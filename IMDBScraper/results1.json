Mercury Rising, I was happy with and entertained, which was what this government cover-up story was all about. As the sort of troubled outcast on somewhat good-terms Willis is a master. This is a lock-fit for him, he does it so well and on the other hand he slips out and accomplishes other performances with just the same skill. I.e. \"The Sixth Sense\" (1999) creepy-good story that he brings that Ole' Willis insight to and gives a leveled measure of believable acting that makes you say \"Wow\". This given, I liked the original working title to the film, Mercury Falling would have worked well too. The autistic boy, (Miko ) is really outstanding at bringing in the over/under balanced brain of Autism to understated believability. He brought that character to it's living end. That is impressive for such young actors to have so much meddle that they can use in their craft. Then there is the one who makes 'hating heavies' a way of life, Alec Baldwin, who always can appear meaner that a bull- rattle snake. His F.B.I man is as solid and scary {as the I would think} the real mean ones come. All in all fairness, this lacked totally connecting everything for a perfect film, but if you watch it uninterrupted and settle in to enjoy what this is, you should get a lot of story entertainment out of it, no problem. There is a lot of garbage made these days, and it is refreshing to see a story that you can watch and take something else away, the next viewing as well.

YOU WILL LIKELY HATE IT!", "Otherwise, you might want to give this one a shot. MDH is far, far off the beaten Hollywood path. It's a quiet, understated film that finds beauty and grace in very unlikely places. Bono and Wim Wenders have put together a love story so unconventional that it nearly defies description... it is certainly NOT a \"tragi-comic, romantic whodunnit\", despite the IMDb plot summary. It's a tale of quiet desperation and pervasive sadness that dares to violate pretty much every unwritten rule in the movie business... further off the wall than \"Being John Malkovich\" but infinitely more subtle and ultimately smarter.", "On the surface it's a tale narrated by an idiot (a dead one at that) which signifies very little. Set in a run-down hotel in which mentally-ill derelicts and freaks are squatting, the film primarily follows Tom-Tom (Jeremy Daviess), a deceptively simple fool who is madly in love with a schizophrenic girl (Milla Jovovich)--who is a heartachingly beautiful hybrid of the Virgin Mary and the Whore of Babylon. The plot is fairly intriguing-- Hardass cop Mel Gibson is investigating the mysterious death of a tycoon's prodigal junkie son. The crazies at the hotel devise an elaborate con job to profit from this tragedy... provided they can bluff a snooty art critic and keep the cops distracted.", "Some humorous moments ensue. But the plot is almost irrelevant here. The film works because of the engaging oddball characters (especially Peter Stormare as an obsessive Beatles fan and Jimmy Smits as a bizarre Native American \"artist\"), because of the brilliantly surreal, postapocalyptic cinematography, and because the sheer naked unhappiness of the film crawls inside of you and doesn't go away for several days. Bono's script, like the best of his music, is deeply cynical about society, but retains a faith in the salvation of individuals. It is neither a comedy, a drama, or a romance... it really just plays out like a bittersweet existential ballad. The only romantic scene features an idiot and a schizoid whore who never actually have sex... but it's one of the most touching love scenes ever captured on film. If that sounds like your cup of tea, check out \"The Million Dollar Hotel\". I don't think you'll be disappointed."]},

(Truly, a sign of the times, and the audience laughed at that one.) Thandie Newton, who I had never seen before, is certainly beautiful, but she carries two expressions on her face through the entire movie, and resembles Ally McBeal in a tighter T-shirt.

His character is more of a James Bond clone than the character is the original movie; I admire his guts and fearlessness for doing several scenes (especially the opening one), and the truth is, he's not bad.
