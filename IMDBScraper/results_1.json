Oakman, great as the heavy in so many westerns, gets a meaty role as the co-owner of a sleazy escort service, co-run with Oscar nominee and major star of the silent era Betty Compson. Compson's daughter, who has been attending fancy boarding schools in other states, does not know what business her Mom is REALLY in, and suddenly appears out of nowhere. When Compson and Oakman learn that the daughter's boyfriend (Robert Kellard, featured in some classic serials, and playing the title character in the 1947 Columbia serial TEX GRANGER) works for the District Attorney's office, things start to get complicated. It's a joy to watch two pros like Compson and Oakman work--Compson's monologues about motherhood and the dirtiness of the escort business are delivered as if they were great literature. Also, this film LOOKS great. The VHS transfer looks as if it were shot yesterday. There's an incredible plot complication about two-thirds of the way through the movie that I won't mention, but is amazing, and the drunken \"confession\" after it is classic. In addition, the great screen drunk Arthur Housman stumbles through one scene, and Rick Vallin is priceless as a gigolo who is stuck with an elderly but rich lady as his date, night after night. It's a running gag throughout the film, and Vallin plays it to the hilt. I've probably watched this film a dozen times over the years. It's not as sleazy as other exploitation films, nor is it weird like a Dwain Esper film--it's VERY competently made. It just has a strange appeal to me. Perhaps it will have a similar effect on you? Fans of Wheeler Oakman or Betty Compson will not want to miss it."]},

Who can define it with certainty about what exactly is life and what truly composes it? Fact: if you're here reading this review\nyou are alive and well and breathing, there's air over your lungs, a pulsating heart with rhythms and beatings, and a brain processing the words you're\nreading and forming an exact view of things at the same time the same brain keeps you alive with all of your internal systems. But there's also this thing\ncalled life where you act, work, play, plan things, evolve or deconstruct the world around you. In the words of Lennon, \"Life happens when you're busy\nmaking other plans\", therefore life is always escaping us when we try to live to the fullest or maybe think that we are living the exact life we wanted or\ndreamed of...or worse, the life others designed for us even though deep down inside we are dreaming of more. Who can truly say they lived a nice life, an\naccomplished life? Life, more than just the terms of breathing and existing, the thing that makes us go forward to some possible evolution or a higher\ndevelopment.", "Although this slightly humored short film \"Esta Não É a Sua Vida\" (\"This Isn't Your Life\") is quite simplistic in its quiet and nice presentation, very\neasy to follow, I overcomplicated for you, fellow reader, because I've got here a very challenging film that made me question things in a manner that very\nfew movies are capable of doing. It begins with actor José Mayer's voice presenting common people and their daily activities and giving one information about\nthem that actually doesn't apply to them. Example: a little girl appears and the narration says that the girl never traveled to the artic; an old lady is\nrevealed to never had been killed her parents. Eccentric explanations but whenever we look to those characters we have the chance to analyze the information\ngiven and if it applies to the person we are seeing. It's all curious to see. Then we get to our leading character.", "Our main star here is a real woman, a lady by the name of Noeli Cavalheiro and she presents some facts of her life through the years. She reflects\nabout her childhood and her past memories as a country girl who married early in life because of her father's influence, a man who created his girl to be\nthe perfect housewife. Those were different times and there are still realities out there who demand that kind of thing. At the time depicted in the film,\nshe was in her late 30's, married and with two kids but as the narrator says \"This isn't your life\". Noeli is more than that, as evidence in a downer bit\nwhere she reveals that she had other plans rather than following the life her father dictated she should follow, she had dreams of being a worker fulfill\ncertain needs and all. So here's the challenge to us: the life she lives as a married woman, although happy and balanced, is a good life, it's a life after\nall or the one where she dreams of accomplishing things she never did and still has the possibilty for it? Living the dream or dreaming the life? We wonder\nyet we don't have enough living time to philosophize those things.", "Writer/director Jorge Furtado, in his early career, made impressive and thought-provoking short films that dared to question things, dared to impress\nus with common people and the strange circumstances of life. His previous entry before this film was the amazing and shocking \"Ilha das Flores\" where he\nstarts the movie with simple statistical facts about a tomato bought by a fictional character played by an actress, the whole process of how this tomato got into\nher hands and later in her meal, and the process of being thrown in the garbage and how some parts of this same tomato, when it finally reaches the dumping ground where is consumed\nby pigs living on a dump island where the food they reject (which they considered unfit for them), is later served to the poorest people of the place who survive\nbecause of the garbage. When you watch the movie, you walk out feeling terrified and disgusted by how mankind can sink so low in terms of humanity. But there's\na catch: that place does not exist in reality, it's all fictional but it's made in such a believable and realistic way that you accept it as fact - altough we\ncan certainly imagine this reality existing somewhere in a less developed country. It feels real.", "I guess the same can be said about this film but in an almost opposite manner. It looks like a fictional work where Furtado hired an actress to present\nsome facts about her character's life and the people audience will try to compose and analyze a view from the woman. Not the case. Noeli is real and the\ndirector simply showed up to her and asked her if he could follow and film her for a while, interview her and then he'd built his film around her. And to\nintrigues us more there's the narration telling us one thing, we process the information and we evaluate if we can believe that or believe the person we are\nseeing it - not to mention that whenever it's said that this isn't your life, the film is making a spoof on the classic TV program \"This is Your Life\"\n(here in Brazil we have similar formats with other names but one can get the spirit of the thing). Here, instead of following a famous personality, we have\nan anonymous from the crowd, with a quiet and simple life, not completely fulfilled but important and magnificent on its own because it is a life, there's\nvalue in there, and there's love, care, and appreciation given to this lady despite her belief that life is a little more than following the footsteps of\nmany other women out there.", "Mr. Furtado throws the matter on us. What is life? Are we living the life we really wanted or we're not there yet? Will we ever be there? Can we\ntruly embrace and accept the life we have at this right moment? What are we doing with the life we have? Is it the life we build ourselves or others did it\nfor us? There's so many variants to reflect and so little time to actually find a meaningful and positive answer.", "Compared to Noeli, I don't have half of\nwhat she has, neither the same positive acceptance with what she has and the quiet resignation with what she doesn't have. I see her as a happy woman, who had\nsome down's and out's but she made it positively well. But we have in common the fact that the life we have isn't the one we wanted. But it's never\ntoo late to get there. And I liked her so much that, if possible, I'd like to see Mr. Furtado going back all the way to that small town and track down\nher whereabouts and show us what happened to her in those 30-something years, like Michael Apted used to do in the \"UP\" series. I tracked down the name on\nthe internet and of the three women with same name as hers, two are from South states (the region where she lives) and could only find (on all) civil actions\nin courts against banks and a condo (thankfully she isn't the source of trouble, others are causing on her). The most recent update is from this year, a\ncouple of months ago.", "For the most part, I can\nonly hope she's alive, well and perhaps had accomplished many things that seemed impossible for her back in the early 1990's since society changed so\nmuch over the decades. And for giving me incredibly difficult insights that actually made me reconsider things about my life (and maybe I can act on it) I'm\ngiving all the praise to this movie and everyone involved with. Thumbs way up! 10/10."]},

It also seems to me to really be about female downward mobility, by a route more usual in real life but less movie cliched than the full fledged drug addiction, leading perhaps to prostitution, chestnuts of yore. None of these girls are going to either themselves, or by marriage \"success\", earn the sorts of incomes their parents did.  Not even close. Dissolution.", "It tracks a few weeks of the \"dating\" lives of four late 20's upper family income girlfriends from a quasi hip strata of west LA.   What they have in common is a battle weary and cynical participation in a relationship scene where low meaning sex is plentiful for reasonably attractive girls (like themselves) and a smaller number of in the scene and very attractive (or skillzed) guys, and taken as the background given.  But where lasting emotional connection, much less love, is very, very elusive -- or non-existent.  Sex with and mostly without lasting personal connection.  But utterly without real romance.  Meanwhile large numbers of guys who don't have player status and who aren't getting any, litter the landscape as a sex needy silent chorus, from the nerdy wannabe younger brother of Claire (Marissa Ribisi), who at least has future possibilities if among other things he'd lose the glasses (and get a few notches in his belt), to Jason's (Giovanni Ribisi) four house mates, who have apparently largely given up, and spend their time endlessly playing scrabble as mating games unfold around them.  All of this is quite realistic, at least as a portrait of the two poles.  (Meanwhile, in the middle, there are a lot of couples that have already paired off, married or most likely not at this late 20's age in the leading urban areas.  But they aren't the subject here.)", "Counter the usual stereotypes, here it is the girls who are easily the most messed up among the ones focused on -- with the partial exception of Neal (Michael Rapaport), April's nice guy and doormat boyfriend, who has a severe case of masochistic clinging and an utter inability to play the game.  One can imagine though that there is hope for him with the right stable relationship sort of girl -- ironically, someone somewhat like Claire, if a bit lower voltage and with more of a take charge personality.  In fact the film frequently draws subtle parallels between Neal's and Claire's positions with those they are seeing -- the situations aren't exactly the same certainly, but there are also many similarities.  Of course neither sees this whatsoever.", "Though the friendship of four girlfriend players (who boast among themselves and for all who care to overhear about the oral skillz) is the near background, the film focuses on Claire, and as well the sort of sex she has decided she doesn't want (any longer), illustrated by her friend April (Juliette Lewis).  April is a full-fledged slut if ever there was one.  In fact her character serves as a current pop culture archetype.  The only possible missing requisite is a fondness for stranger gang bangs, though one could hardly rule that out.  Mostly she doesn't seem ambitious enough to organize them herself.  Her normal operating routine, most nights a week, is to wake up the next morning in some new house she doesn't recognize, stumble to the curb so as not to have to deal with whoever she discovers is lying next to her (and we almost never see these he's), and call one of her girl friends or her doormat boyfriend (!) to come pick her up.  \"Don't ask\", she always says.  So much for the background.", "Claire, whose wildly red and wildly curly hair, framing alabaster skin, make her easily the most interesting looking and exotically attractive of the four friends (if you can overlook her increasingly beaten looking eyes), has settled into a  pattern of serial short term relationships, which invariably break her heart.   This, she quickly spills to Jason, is because within a couple of weeks they either stop calling her, or she discovers they are real jerks.  Either way, another broken heart.  (A bit easy in the heart department, per chance?)  She doesn't want to get it wrong again this time, she plaintively tells him.  \"OK, we'll take it slow\" he reassures her. Actually, he tries to, within the ready sex ethos they are living in.  It soon becomes apparent that she is the one who can't.  What she always does wrong becomes glaringly apparent, for those with eyes to see and enough knowledge to understand.  The problem isn't really sex too soon.  The problem is clinging dependence too soon -- and too much.", "Claire begins as a winningly vulnerable and open character, and initially I had real hopes for her, and for her with Jason.  She may not be good at the game, but she sure seemed to have an open and beautiful heart.  She believes in devoted love.  Their relationship begins promisingly enough.  Their magazine rack scene together is sweet.  He too is a romantic, looking for emotional connection far more than sex (which he takes for granted, as do all the players, especially the girls).  He picks Claire up at a magazine stand in a way that at first appears to be simple understated confidence, combined with disarmingly dispensing with line routines.  He sees her, and as he pretty much just says, is intrigued by the contrast of her flaming hair against her pale white skin,  as she is more than used to hearing.  (He is also attracted to her subtle but evidently submissive demeanor, though that is something he acts upon, rather than expresses.)   He manages to disarm Claire's reasonably robust shields against pretty boy pickups, by calm, not going anywhere, persistence and innocent charm.  It's also the last time she manages to try to resist him.  ", "By the first scene of their ensuing next day date,  I was clued to him being a master pickup artist.  His not specifying on his call where they would go on their first date was a clue to his having already scoped a good part of her nature, but wasn't conclusive.  He first brings her to a laundromat where he casually folds the clothes he had previously left, while soothingly reassuring her, asking her if she's upset.  \"Well\" she says smiling uncertainly, \"what's next -- the supermarket?\".  \"No\" he reassures her, \"although I'd like to do that with you too.  I had something more like a nice restaurant in mind.\"  Then I knew.  Pure seduction genius, for someone like Claire (and a lot of women).   (It's about being together, not about him having to prove his worthiness to her.)  He has her totally on the way by then, of course.  Back at his room, after he's lit the two candles and turned on the opera aria, he says softly after stroking her:  \"I don't want to f*** you tonight Claire\".  This is followed of course by her hiding her crest fallen disappointment, her shields of \"of course\" and \"I brought my car\" coming up as she bravely tries to mask that and HOPES he's just going TOO slow, as he said he would, but will want to the next time.  All this we can see in Marissa Ribissi's wonderfully expressive sad but bravely smiling face.   After a pause, and after gently stroking her arm and the side of her face again, Jason follows that with: \"No Claire. No. ...  I want to make love to you tonight, really make love\".  Of course it's her coupe de grace.  Not for her sex -- that was long a sure thing.  For her heart -- for emotionally deeply connected first sex.  She is totally, totally gone by then, or anyway by the time he follows through.  You can bet they made beautiful music together.  ", "That's the sort of thing a whole lot of women want the first time with someone, almost all women (with whatever lead in approach works for them), but lots of guys seem to either not want, or be unable to pull off with someone they aren't already head over heals in love with.  He's a master, natural or otherwise -- if we overlook his cliched \"just released from college\" room props, which are after all good enough in this context.", "Still though, I wasn't counting out a relationship between them at this stage.  He really is the romantic type.  Relationships and the heart are what he is after.  We never actually learn enough about him to know if he feels compelled to endlessly move on to new full mind and body seductions, or whether he is just looking for the right one, but doing it skillfully. We do learn that he's the sort of guy who's got it down so well that he doesn't have to spend much time in the desert between relationships. Choices he's got.  More than anyone else in the film.  This too is realistic, though he represents the top of the male magnetic pyramid.  (The ones with by far the least choices are the sex needy guys, rather than any girrls, which the film uses only as background noise, and most young female viewers are unlikely to even really notice -- or dismiss simply as losers.)"]},

It was made in the sixties, which was the last gasp of Denmark as a nation of open-minded people.

In some scenes she seems really shocked or at least surprised by the action, not method acting but probably due to improvisation.", "Nuchtern's very poor script structure has Tania's boyfriend Paul (Paul Cox) nearly bowled over by the boys as they exit the building, and he soon embarks on a film-long quest for revenge after Tania tells him about the rape. Nuchtern has done porn, action, drama and horror movies, but I'd hate to see a mystery film (or even police procedural) from him based on the lame plotting here.", "Blundering along, Paul interviews people trying to identify and find the whereabouts of the hooligans, with a prostitute/dancer Lynn (energetic soft porn regular Jackie Richards) giving him info about her pimp -Nick. This leads Paul to a car repair company serving as a front, run by Frank (one-note tough guy actor Alaistair Burr), where Nick supposedly works.", "We've had some okay topless footage and the film has plodded along acceptably to this point, but it becomes very silly in a hurry. Frank is working on some multi-million dollar drug deal (completely unbelievable) for which Nuchtern rented a Peugeot but otherwise delivers puny action footage.", "The good guys, including Tania and Paul (and later Lynn) are kidnapped and tied up in bondage to be tortured for information about how much they now about the baddies' skulduggery, and Nuchtern ends up with an asinine shoot-out finish that is staged like a backyard movie made by kids in elementary school. I know that \"anyone can make a movie\", especially now in the shoot-it-on-video era, but Nuchtern was ahead of his time in blatant amateurism.", "Several members of the cast also appeared in a poor soft porn film by Sidney Knight titled LOVE IS WHERE IT'S AT, in which Alaistair gives a particularly embarrassing performance. Spence is tediously creepy as the pimp/rapist, while thick-lipped Peters as his violent partner in crime is merely awful.", "The moronic blogger/shill Robin who wrote the SWV liner notes makes a big deal of this being R. Bolla's first film in the lead role credited to unknown Paul Cox; it's untrue and the actor looks nothing like porn veteran Bolla, resembling F. Murray Abraham (and that's a real stretch, too) more.

Cherie Chung does very well, she had matured as an actress by then and did not need to rely solely on her beauty. She is completely believable. This is an erotically charged drama which, while not a happy film because its all about keeping yourself under the radar to avoid being deported, is good because it flows well and the characters have that sense of longing for love and redemption etched onto their faces.

It is a moving picture plenty of passion , romances , love breaking , human relationships and many other things . The movie explores issues of middle and lower classes with bad-paid , part-time works , examining the way in which a society , especially young people , react to the ordinary problems throughout their lives . It is an examination of sensitivity contemporary , social and habit concerns . From start to finish the intense drama , enjoyable comedy , thrills , emotion and surprises are continuous . Interesting and stirring screenplay by Juan Flahn , the prestigious Fernando León de Aranoa and the same director Chus Gutiérrez . This brooding as well as attractive flick can be defined as a thought-provoking drama , an exciting fresco with emotion , love stories and a social fable . It contains enjoyable and interesting moments as the picture is more a drama than a comedy film . It's an acceptable movie but it also has ups and downs , resulting to be slow-moving , too . Anyway , its is compensated with the great performances , as the cast gets credible and nuanced acting that enrich the flick . This film grabs our attention , beginning with a really agreeable performance from Cristina Marcos and Candela Peña . In fact , Cristina Marcos won award Best Actress for Insomnio in Peñíscola Comedy Film Festival , 1998 . Support cast is pretty good such as Ginés García Millán , Fele Martínez , Saturnino García , Alberto San Juan , Chete Lera , Mariola Fuentes , Antonio De La Torre who usually plays in Chus Gutierrez's films and Amara Carmona who starred ¨Alma Gitana¨ . The movie packs a charming and brilliant musical score by Mateo Alonso . And adequate as well as atmospheric cinematography by Arnaldo Catinari , being shot on locations from Madrid . ", "The yarn is always dramatic as well as hilarious when is executed with style and the filmmaker certainly seems to have that . The motion picture well produced by Cesar Benitez was professionally directed by Chus Gutiérrez . She is one of the best Spanish directors who has realized some good films such as ¨Alma Gitana¨, ¨Sexo Oral¨ , ¨Sublet¨, ¨Ciudad Delirio¨ , ¨Calentito¨ and a diptych titled ¨Poniente¨ along with ¨Retorno a Hansal¨ , both of them dealing with illegal immigration and a similar cast as Jose Coronado , Cuca Escribano , Antonio Dechent and Antonio De La Torre ."]},

Nothing he reads couldn't have been conveyed with sound effects or dialogue, or even some creative inner-dialogue. It would have been far more interesting to follow the main character in this way, but with the narration it didn't let the story unfold, and it wouldn't let the animation tell the story visually (if you're at all familiar with how an animated movie can be effective you know this is a huge problem).", "The claymation would have been that much more vivid if it had been matched to some sound effects, or even some good music, but that's yet another point of contention: the music for the most part is jingly Christmas music, which doesn't fit the animation AT ALL.

This movie, unlike some dumb slapstick Italian sex comedy, has a lot of dialogue and fairly intricate plot that is hard to follow if you don't understand Italian very well.", "The movie seems to be about a nymphomaniac (Lisa Gastoni), who has become a respectable married woman, but continues to have lots of humiliating sexual encounters with any number of unattractive (and in some cases pretty elderly) men, much to the consternation of her professor husband (Corrado Pani). She has public sex in a bell-tower while a parade is going on in the town below. She gets gang-banged in a night café in a visually memorable scene lit my neon lights flashing red and blue. And when she sees a creep sneaking the room of her nubile maid(at least, I think it's her maid)in order to feel up the nude body of slumbering young girl, she comes to the rescue--by having sex with the guy! She also has lots of flashbacks of her prostitute mother, and I suspect at least some of the sex sequences might actually be fantasies, like the opening scene where she is gang-raped, apparently by what looks to be some kind of androgynous zombiesque motorcycle gang.", "This movie has some elements of a giallo (like the title and the visual style), a horror movie (like the opening sequence), and social drama, which is what Lisa Gastoni really specialized in the 70's. The scene with the young maid(?), for instance, resembles a famous scene from Fernando DiLeo's \"The Seduction\" where the Gastoni character's boyfriend sneaks into the room of her adolescent daughter to check her out while she sleeps. But this sequence here manages to be even MORE kinky. Director Giulio Perio is mostly know for spaghetti Westerns like \"Death Rides a Horse\". He is not as talented as some other Gastoni collaborators like DiLeo or Salvatore Samperi (\"Scandalo\"). Still, I would like to see a better-looking version of this movie (with English subtitles) before passing too much judgment on it."]},

There's a minimum of dialog, only that needed to move the story forward, whatever it was, and an emphasis on slapstick that some might find odd considering who's involved. This was probably aimed at families, and while kids might be amused the real joy here is for genre film enthusiasts to get to see Tony Kendall aping D'artangan & Stan Cooper taking a pie in the face. Who can pass that up?", "Director Silvio Amadio is best remembered for his kinky Giallo sex thriller AMUCK with Barbara Bouchet & Rosalba Neri writhing in bed together, but proves himself a capable action director with derring do + oaths of loyalty galore. The climactic few minutes get a bit hectic with the various subplots weaving together into a whirlwind that manages to shuffle the stars off to the sides with some annoying potty humor, but it's over quickly enough and everyone ends up smelling like a rose.

His neglected, hot-to-trot wife (Swedish porn star Marina Hedman) meanwhile takes every opportunity to cuckold him with the studly butler (although actually he's more fat than studly--he looks kind of like an Italian Ron Jeremy), or, when he's busy with the maid (African-American porn star--and alleged transsexual--Ajita Wilson), she just uses on her own fingers. After several long (and quite boring) sex scenes, the plot as it were kicks in when the scientist's adolescent daughter (Cinzia DiCarolis) returns from convent school. Her sex-crazed stepmother hits on her (at least, I hope to god she is only her stepmother!), but the girl instead becomes quite, um, enamored with her father's genetically modified snake after it protects her TWICE from being raped. She releases the snake, and it quickly makes short work of the rest of the cast (I'm no herpetologist, but I don't think the same snake could be both a constrictor AND deadly poisonous like this one--but maybe it's the human DNA?) ", "It's kind of weird seeing Cinzia DiCarolis in a film like this. DiCarolis started out as a child actress in movies like Dario Argento's second film \"Cat of Nine Tails\", and grew into a kind of slightly more attractive version of Linda Blair. Her most famous role was as a bizarrely dressed nymphet-next-door who tempts John Saxon's character back to his cannibalistic ways in \"Cannibal Apocalypse\" (and in which she delivers the immortal, dubbed line: \"No one has ever bitten me like that before!\"). This is no \"Cannibal Apocalypse\", but DeCarolis, at least, really outdoes herself. She doesn't get as down and dirty as Hedman and Wilson (who briefly share a double-headed dildo in one scene), but she does have naked \"sex\" scenes with the snake, which may be even more perverted, depending on your point of view. And it's best not to even think of the Freudian implications of a girl falling in love with father's \"snake\"--believe me, this movie is sleazy enough on a completely literal level."]},

However, treating concentration camp atrocities such as rape and murder in a jocular fashion actually proves just as objectionable as the genre's harsher and more notorious entries, if not more so. Slapping a whimsical soundtrack over the degradation and abuse of female prisoners is in very poor taste, detracting from the very real suffering experienced by thousands at the hands of the Nazis. At least the likes of SS Experiment Camp, Gestapo's Last Orgy and The Beast in Heat didn't treat the subject matter as a bit of a laugh (even the genre's more camp entries kept a straight face).", "That said, the film's approach makes it one of the more unique examples of Nazisploitation, and since when did fans of the genre worry about good taste anyway? Liebes Lager delivers forced communal showers and internal examinations, with plenty of full frontal nudity. Unlike a lot of Nazisploitation films, there's very little in the way of torture, but the final act delivers quite a bit of violence during a battle between allied forces and the Germans, with the women, tits out and naked from the waist down, making a bid for freedom."]},

Unfortunately, the film is hampered by the fact the film seems to rely to much on jump cuts to different things while the girls are enjoying sex. At one point the two girls watch a stag film and the film cuts to the the film, but then on the version I have it cuts to a film that looks like it would have been made in the 90's or 2000's. Not sure why they did this, my guess is they wanted to vary up the stag film, or perhaps there was an underage performer in it, but it seems to me they could have found something from the 70's to insert so it would not have seemed so out of place.", "The story is about two friends. One who really enjoys sex, Marla, and one who enjoys sex, but likes to act like she is innocent, Debbie. They go from one sex filled adventure to the other. Not much of a plot to this one, but not a lot of dead time either as it pretty much moves from one scene to the next. They go from sex in a van, to a lesbian scene, to a strange couple where the story is told two different ways to the finale at Debbie's house with two guys.", "The two girls are really cute. The girl who played Debbie has a really good look about her as she looks so surprised at times during the sex. She has a real girl next door type look that really makes her scenes work. The other girl, Marla, could pass for Drew Barrymore as she has the same mouth. Though you cannot say she is copying the actress as this film predates Drew. Both are so attractive, but the film is hampered by the fact the sex scenes are so rushed. You get a trade off, films in the 70's has hotter situations and more real like sex; however, adult films today have the ability to get better angles during the sex due to the fact the equipment is probably easier to maneuver. Back then you have film so it covers the girls' blemishes, but today you get way longer sex scenes. I mean, I like the stories and how the sex unfolds better, but it is always so rushed in some of these films and the only thing that lasts a long time are the scenes of oral sex on the guys and I am not wild about looking at other guy's dongs and seeing their sweaty faced reactions. Not sure why guys do like watching these, I like seeing the girls having sex, getting oral and their reactions.", "So, it was not that great of an adult film. The girls were cute, but the scenes suffer from the typical rushed mentality or to many cutaways during the actual sex. The last sex scene was pretty good, but they really needed to pace it better and make it hotter. Actually, just reduce the guy getting oral sex, so again this is a personal preference. However, once he was finished it was hot watching Debbie get down and dirty, only they needed to focus on her more, kept cutting away. Still, it was the best scene in the film with the longest sex shown. Too bad they cannot somehow make films like this today using the technology so they appear on film and with a story, but with the longer sex scenes."]},

It is this precise disjointedness that characterizes \"Madeleine,\" though it's not a complete failure.", "The film does manage to be engrossing even while the narrative feels oblique and arbitrary, and this is largely because the cinematography and visuals are more or less effective, and the film also functions as a time capsule of gaudy '70s European style. Keaton's performance is overwritten by bad dubbing, and, as is the case with most Italian horror fodder of this period, the dialogue feels disingenuous, sometimes absurd, and at times laughable.", "Despite its shortcomings, the film does have a clever ending that is borderline-Hitchcockian, and I was caught off guard by it.

The meandering narrative punctuated by a number of LSD-esque visuals leaves the viewer wanting something a bit more, as none of the themes really coalesce. The conclusion, to some degree, acts as a cop-out to fill in the gaps that precede it. That being said, it is worth watching for fans of Camille Keaton, as well as anyone with a curiosity or interest in 1970s Italian psychological horror--it is certainly strange. 6/10."]},

Fause pays hims $300 to hump her, but he refuses when she insists on a rubber (she's trying for pregnancy from Margold, not him). The concept of a XXX gigolo who is militant against the use of rubbers is preposterous, whether posited in free-wheeling '70s pre-AIDs time or now, and I almost got the impression that CT was mounting yet another dumb soap box in support of \"freedom\".", "Among the embarrassments is Margold, who provides a video commentary for the 2014 DVD reissue (I militantly refuse to listen to such nonsense) and doesn't seem to realize he's the butt of the film's joke. Despite himself and many other characters talking about his erections (and failures), he never gets hard -having the ability (shared with Tobalina's favorite performer John Holmes) to penetrate and even ejaculate while still perennially soft, what is euphemistically called \"semi-erect\", and the visual proof is here. One stupid scene has him supposedly humping his wife 3 times in succession, but the first and second money shots are merely the first one repeated from a different camera angle.", "About four reels too long, dreary picture features not one but two \"surprise\" endings, idiotic and poorly staged which I won't spoil here - Tobalina already spoiled them himself."]},

If you're into that type of thing then I'm sure you'll love this but others should stay clear. The film pretty much has de Sade (Rocco Siffredi) spitting on people, trying to choke them and in one scene peeing on them.

The entire movie was a real pain to sit through because of how ugly it is. Even the rather good cinematography gets lost in all the junk.

He pulls that off again in MATINEE IDOL, a later-day Henri Pachard XXXer that's short on plot but surprisingly long on entertainment.", "The story finds feuding porno thesps John Leslie and Jesie St. James getting into a fight on set that threatens to derail their latest production. With the two retreating to their separate residences, it's up to producers Harvey Cox and Bernard Kuntz (Elmo Lavino and Friedman, respectively) to find a couple newcomers to fill their shoes. Following a long series of auditions, the pair finally pulls in Daisy Cheney (Angel) to substitute for St. James, while the actress herself seizes on studly pool cleaner Herschel Savage to fill Leslie's... er, shoes. With St. James and Leslie forced to work together one last time before their replacements ascend to the limelight, is there any chance sparks might reignite, or is it curtains for porno's marquee duo?", "Having watched MATINEE IDOL several years earlier on what was, at the time, a fairly rare uncut beta, I was impressed by its easy flow, brisk pacing, and pleasantly puerile comedy. Catching up with it again via Vinegar Syndrome's recent reissue, I was delighted to find it held up. Friedman and Pachard manage to wring an impressive amount of mileage out of their paper-thin premise, with the film moving surprisingly swiftly considering how little plot there is. Leslie and St. James basically just sulk the whole time and drown their sorrows in sex before patching things up at the conclusion, which resolves itself as quickly and arbitrarily as their initial falling out. It's a testament to the cast and writing that the material flies as well as it does, with numerous scintillating sexual encounters helping propel the film forward and making it seem breezier than many other features a good reel shorter.", "Production values appear satisfyingly high, and are, again, a result of Friedman's well-honed knack for making the most out of nothing. It's not that IDOL is bursting with locations and cast, but that nothing feels threadbare - the film moves between settings freely and its locations always feel sufficiently populated and decorated, not sparse. Things only fall apart at the end, where the movie shirks its in-film premiere (cobbled together out of stock shots of LA's Pussycat Theater) for a scene featuring Leslie and St. James coming to terms in private. Clearly conceived as the emotional centerpiece of the movie, this sequence (a large excerpt of which forms its teaser-length trailer) features the couple masturbating across from each other on opposite couches, with their growing mutual lust conveyed in a series of longing looks that alternate between desire and constipation. It's only semi-successful, but the film at least earns points for trying, and the sequence remains a memorable moment, even if its thunder is stolen by a mid-film sequence featuring Colleen Brennan making love to Herschel Savage's foot. Toss in plenty of Friedman's trademark bawdy wordplay and you have a fun and frothy concoction that doesn't chart any new ground but delivers a solid and surprisingly brisk 90 minutes of adult entertainment. By 1984, that itself was a minor miracle in itself for a porn film, but old pros Friedman and Pachard make it look easy."]},

It's at a much slower pace than a typical poliziotteschi, though I didn't find that onerous. Typical for the scenes in Sicily, there is a strong Syracuse element rather than being purely Palermo orientated. Typical of mafiosi movies, the protagonist plays a very different role. Typical of an Italian '60s-'70s movie, it's a poliziotteschi with Anthony Steffan, rather than a Spaghetti Western. While there's nothing really outstanding about it, it's a solid, straight ahead poliziotteschi. Personally I would put it in the top tier of the sub-genre, though. My criterion for that is simple. Middle tier is for movies that are good, but you'd probably have to be a fan of the genre to like. Top tier are movies that people that aren't fans of the genre would probably like as well.

Fear and madness begin to overtake them. But is there more to the graveyard than meets the eye? Perhaps, perhaps not.

It could be that they are simply lost in the graveyard, but at times they seem to be going straight but ending up where they began. It plays on conventions and stereotypes as our male lead becomes angry and violence prone. Since it is he who triggers the inciting incident, it is of course him that the obligatory scene at the climax must focus more one. But ultimately it's the female lead and her surreal serenity that leaves us with a climax you won't find in many gore encrusted horror films."]},

The film is interesting in the same way that Leos Carax's later short film Sans Titre (1996) was interesting; offering us a window into his particular creative world and establishing many of the ideas and characteristics that would later be found in Carax's own underrated masterpiece Pola X (1999). Carax, of course, is one of the filmmakers most clearly influenced by Godard, even appearing as an actor in Godard's widely criticised adaptation of King Lear (1987), as well as paying homage to the older filmmaker with his earliest films, Boy Meets Girl (1984) and Mauvais Sang (1986).", "Like Sans Titre, Scénario de 'Sauve qui peut la vie' is presented in the style of an esoteric visual essay, with the use of on-screen titles, still images, stock footage, narration and the usual Godardian interest in visual metaphors, juxtapositions and alienation techniques. On the soundtrack, Godard talks personally about his ambitions for the project, its themes and influences and what he hopes the film will achieve, whilst attempting to contextualise some of the vague and enigmatic ideas expressed in the film itself. While he discusses his intentions we see some early examples of the methods that he is interested in, with still photographs of the three lead actors and crudely shot video footage that presents a germ of an idea later elaborated upon in the eventual, finished film. Godard also talks about his interest in using slow motion and cross dissolves as well as the super-imposition of images on top of images to create the idea of time being literally stretched, and the possible interpretations that these devises could offer.", "Godard also talks about the implications of the title, Sauve qui peut (la vie). At its most simplified level, the title of Godard's eventual film was translated as 'Every Man for Himself', which is incorrect, and lacks the obvious pun of (la vie), since the sentence as a whole simply doesn't translate particularly well from the original French. It does suggest certain ideas that Godard himself talks about in the film in question, with the character of the television director played by Jacques Dutronc, whose selfishness and volatile relationships with the various women in his life make up one facet of the film's complicated emotional design, as well as making an ironic judgement on the once radical 60's generation that Godard was very much part of; a generation now consumed by commercialised consumption, greed and pointless self-examination.", "The title used in the UK, Slow Motion, is also alluded to by Godard, not only with the slow pace that the final film will employ, but with the idea of slowing down moments in the attempt to see beyond the surface action and instead, to see whether or not there is something else happening behind the facade of this ever moving tableau. Ultimately, Godard's ideas remain vague and more interesting than enlightening, forcing the viewer to question whether or not this short work is for our benefit, or indeed, for Godard's. Still, the window that it presented into the director's particular way of working is fascinating, with the accumulation of ideas and images rendered on film before a frame of the eventual project had even been shot demonstrating quite clearly that Godard has a definitive idea of where his film's are going and the shape that they will eventually take."]},

Mary goes home to fetch some clothing, and of course daddy grabs her, takes her up to the attic and ties her up for some good old-fashioned incest. The ugly blonde lady goes after her, and she too is reduced to bondage, with the attic's floor space starting to get mighty crowded (the maid is literally still hanging around).", "Only in idiotic \"movies\" at this level do the dumb twists keep on comin': the \"hero\" and blondie's b.f. keep delaying their inevitable \"to the rescue\" trip, with an old female acquaintance visiting and keeping them very busy in a threesome. Finally the procrastinating pair whips into action, rushes the attic and beats up old daddy. Denouement is so memorably lousy that Alpha Blue Archives uses it as one of its DVD signature intros: daddy is in a strait jacket at an asylum (you have to imagine that -it's just a bare set) voicing over all sorts of self-serving gibberish, meant to remind you of the unfortunately tacked on ending of PSYCHO, minus the fly. For some reason his hair color has gotten real dark for this ending, making daddy look not like Ted Turner but rather like junior.", "Film relentlessly steals music from PSYCHO, even mickey mousing a money shot to the \"shrieking strings\" from that movie, and also throws in Bernard Herrmann themes from some of his other classics like THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL and VERTIGO for good measure.

Meanwhile I'm wondering about the influence on Kurosawa, because he was third assistant director on this movie. Bits and pieces, bibs and bobs of shots and scenes and plot points, and even characters who would later appear in Kurosawa films, show up here, and I am left wondering how much influence a third assistant director has, the half-life of images in movies - if Kurosawa stole them, how long would he have to wait before someone called him out on the theft, especially given this movie's director, Eisuke Takizawa, was still averaging a couple of movies a year when he died in 1966, only 64 years old.", "One of the problems of an American like me, trying to understand studio-era Japanese films is that they are so hard to find. Kurosawa, no problem, and late Mizoguchi, but other than that, we were told for decades, it was just for the local market, nothing you'd be interested in seeing. Although the situation remains difficult, stuff has been dribbling through, with variable image quality and often poor translation into English. Looking at this movie, we can see a Japanese film maker who strongly influenced Kurosawa, and so he is not someone who arose out of nowhere, borrowed from the world's literature, and proceeded to give it a handling unlike anything before seen. I see it here, and it's very entertaining.", "I recognize that some people will think that by writing that, I am slighting Kurosawa. Not at all! If Isaac Newton could write that if he saw further than others, it was because he stood on the shoulders of giants, it was because Bertrand de Chartres had said something very similar in the 13th Century. I bring a message not to sour you on Kurosawa, but to encourage you to dig into old Japanese films as I have: there are giants there too."]},

Of course Franco is a wretched coward - until he wears his late brother's hat which transforms him into \"The Best\" of the neighborhood. The movie just looks good, very nice sets and costumes.

I had had rather mixed feelings towards the book while reading it (kind of a love-hate relationship), and this film actually made me like the entire story much better. I liked it so much that only a couple weeks later I ordered the 2008 version, and just finished watching it last night. Wow, what a difference! Although the 2008 one has the advantage of some higher quality filming and an extra hour of screen time (more is usually better in my mind when it comes to my literature-based time period films), I found the newer to be considerably inferior to this one! This version has a MUCH better cast all around. I don't think you can beat this actress's rendition of Tess; I knew she was good in it, but couldn't fully appreciate HOW good until I saw the other version. 1998 Tess is way more convincing than 2008 Tess. My heart goes out to her, whereas 2008 Tess actually got on my nerves. 1998 Angel is much much better as well. The difference in both roles is astounding. I even thought the smaller parts, like Tess's parents and the other milkmaids, were better done in this one. The only exception I make, is that I did think the 2008 Alec D'Urberville more like how I pictured him when I read the book; 1998 Alec does a fine job, is more subtle in his portrayal, but simply does not match so much what I thought he would look and sound like.", "Although there is an hour less in this film than the other, I still felt like this one is more generally accurate. I am much more tolerant of deletions from book to film (of course they can't fit everything in) than I am about alterations. There was more material in the 2008 version, but they took more liberties, which simply annoys me. This version, while it couldn't have every detail, what was there was very accurate for the most part. And it captures the story in its entirety quite well for its time constraints.", "If you're a Jane Austen fan (as I am), understand that this is NOT a Jane Austen story, which tend to be like fairy tales with happy endings; there are \"bad guys\" in her books, but they are not a real hindrance to the real heroines. This is a grittier story, not set in the posh genteel society of the gentry and nobility; lots of low people, lots of hard labor, lots of reality. And there are the \"bad guys\", and then those characters which tread the line between \"good\" and \"bad\". It's definitely more complex, definitely more drama, but very worthwhile if you're up to it and know what you're getting into. If it is your first experience with this story, don't expect your viewing to be a relaxing ride. There is plenty to make you furious, happy, sad...lots of strong emotions.", "When I first read this book, it was something of an emotional roller coaster (I'd absolutely adore one character, only to hate them intensely a few chapters later, and so on), but now that I'm more familiar with the story, I can appreciate it better. It sinks under your skin and makes you keep thinking about it. This movie leaves you like that, too. It's an excellent rendition of an excellent book."]},

Another comment said She-ra was based loosely off of Wonder Woman...this may be so, but I honestly believe that She-ra was the main inspiration fot the famous \"Xena: Warrior Princess.\"  My friend and I found old tapes of She-ra at the library.  After viewing it today, older and wiser, the stories truly are brilliantly done and there is even more humor than what I remembered.  I recommend She-ra to anyone who loves action and fantasy."]},

She is infatuated by the suave artist and spends the night with him.

In those days women seldom had a career of their own. This drama is presented in a polite and well mannered way, almost too low key taking the subject matter into account.

The film should get some sort of award for setting back the public's acceptance of the mentally retarded at least 50 years with this awful bit. I wanted to laugh at it, but also realized such sick characters are no laughing matter--just sad and pathetic.", "Overall, a stupid film that is bad even for a low-budget B.

And a mere couple of seconds later, he flinches again as the dog-tag is ripped from his neck.", "Featured in ", " (1998)", "The ordinary trajectory in a film like this during times like these is for Vann, like Philip Caputo, Ron Kowalsky and numerous other figures before him, to enter the service on the verge of exploding with patriotism, idealism, and gung-ho-ness, then to learn that the Vietnamese war was a big mistake as he is turned around by the events he witnesses.  Kind of like what happens to David Janssen in \"The Green Berets,\" only in reverse.  Not so here.  This is a complex and admirable story of a complex and not entirely admirable man.  He is sent to Vietnam as a Lt. Colonel, bursting with enthusiasm and with his eye on promotions, true, but he does not undergo an epiphany in which God or the Buddha appears shaking a finger at him.  He wants to win the war but feels it's being fought inefficiently.  We need to coopt the communist revolution by getting rid of the corrupt and cowardly Vietnamese officers and giving the rice back to the peasants or something like that.  He makes his views known to the press and is more or less forced to resign his commission.  (The story is a bit murky on this point.)  After a few years' dry spell at home he is called back to Vietnam as some sort of civilian advisor who now wears the two stars of a general and issues military orders.  He has not lost his enthusiasm or his idealism and comes to believe that we can now win the war by conventional means, even after Tet.  He orchestrates a heroic victory over the North Vietnamese army, then his career ends, as does his life.  That's not what I would call the usual ten-cent trajectory in character development.  It isn't nearly linear enough.  And in that nonlinearity it resembles life more than it does fiction.  Is Vann a hero?  Undoubtedly.  Is he a good man?  Well -- yes and no.  After his marriage (to the character played by Amy Madigan) he sleeps with the 15-year-old babysitter.  In Vietnam he evidently lies to a beautiful young woman he seduces and tells her he's separated from his wife. On his return to Vietnam he looks up the girl again.  She seems just as gorgeous, at least to these eyes, but she's changed her hair or something so he avoids her.  Instead he takes up with a schoolgirl and gets her pregnant. When confronted with his self-evident guilt by the girl's father, he marries her.  On the other hand, he doesn't smoke or drink.  There is an attempt to account for his misbehavior by means of some half-hearted palaver about how his mother was a whore.  He was an illegitimate child and blames this status for keeping him out of West Point and getting him booted out of the army.  The film betrays itself here if the writers and producers really meant to put forward this information as a pat explanation of his various failures, but if they meant it mainly as the way the protagonist attempts to justify God's ways to Vann, they hit the nail on the head.  (Sure I'm flawed.  Wouldn't you be, with a mother like mine?)  The combat scenes are pretty effective, and so is Ed Lauter, playing a sympathetic guy for a change.  Too bad the leads aren't.  Whatever \"charisma\" means, Bill Paxton as Vann doesn't have it, though he looks the part; and the reporter from the New York Times, with whom Vann has a falling out, generates a rather large hole whenever he is on screen.  The girls are indescribably delicious.  Neil Sheehan, on whose book this story was based, has a tendency to stretch for drama and characters that aren't there.  His earlier book could not turn the Captain of the USS Vance into Queeg.  But judging from this film, he has presented a more complicated picture of a man here, a more adult portrait, warts and all.  All together, the time spent watching this movie is well spent.  I'm not sure how close I would like to get to a man who didn't smoke or drink and who called down artillery fire on his own position but it's fascinating to know something about him at this remove."]},

And so on about other \"comments\" available here. The film has a very intelligent plot, written by the famous russian SF writer Kir Bulichev. The director's work is excellent. For example Niya's character is played by non-professional actress Elena Metyolkina, who actually was a model. It was the director's design just to introduce some elements of robot-like behavior. The director managed to make her play as good as possible. All other actors play their characters very persuadingly also. I just wonder how can one abuse the music - it is superb. Of course there should be correction for poor picture and sound quality, presented on the Americanized version. But this film deserves to be watched in its original version and with the TRUE dubbing - JUST TO UNDERSTAND IT. BTW now its remastered version on DVD exists, with both picture and sound quality being superb.", "Summing up I want to say this film is not a cheap entertainment as some comments here suggest. It is a very kind, heartful, gentle, touching and thought-provoking movie. It is about love - love to people, love to the Earth. Of course there is certain naivity about the film, but it only adds positive to its atmosphere. I see everything quite balanced in it. Some may see flaws in film's imperfect setting (compared with \"Alien\" or \"Star Wars\" for example)- of course Holliwood was much more advanced in Sci-fi making (and a lot richer besides), than the Soviet cinema.

With the presence of Ginger Lynn and Nina Hartly in their \"youngest\" days, the sex is mouth-watering to say the least.  From the delicious murder (by electrocution) of two lovelies who are entertaining themselves with a huge double-headed dildo to the opening sequence of Ginger and Harry Reems sex acts with the malicious mail carrier tossing mail through the maildrop and interrupting their exploits, this is great erotic filmmaking at its best!!

Freeman burst onto the film scene with a sharp portrayal of bored inner city kids.  Motivated by stealing, disarmed by love, the film was highly entertaining if a bit flawed.  \"Desert Blue\" is Freeman's second film and represents his attempt to reach the opposite end of the spectrum. This time, instead of a population of millions, we now get a population of 97. The film is set in fictional Baxter, California, the home of the world's largest ice cream cone and the factory of burgeoning cola company Empire Cola.  When a truck carrying Empire's secret ingredient has a massive accident and subsequent spill, the town in quarantined and put on alert for possible toxic contaminants.  The town locals, who never thought about leaving their boring town before, now become antsy and think about life outside of Baxter.  Kate Hudson (\"200 Cigarettes\") and John Heard play two travelers who were passing through Baxter during the spill.  They become part of the quarantine and befriend the locals. Brendan Sexton III (\"Hurricane Streets\"), Casey Affleck (\"Good Will Hunting\"), Christina Ricci (Everything independent), and Ethan Suplee (\"Mallrats\") play the local kids.  The ride around all day in ATVs and spend their nights drinking by the long aquaduct.  Each kid harbors a long standing resentment to Baxter, and each kid expresses that uniquely.  Ricci by anarchy, Affleck by ATV racing, Suplee has a long dream of becoming a deputy, and Sexton tries to keep the family business alive, thought it died a long time ago. \"Desert Blue\" is somewhat a comedy, somewhat a drama, and somewhat a commercial for poor actors.  While it's nice to see old faces like Sara Gilbert (\"Roseanne\") and Michael Ironside (\"Total Recall\") in small supporting roles, the rest of the cast is laughably bad.  I do understand that they might be trying to conveying boredom, but they do it just a touch too realistically.  That leaves the film with a very awkward static atmosphere. The best moments of the film come when Freeman lets his actors and the plot get a bit silly.  The film comes alive in scenes of Orange baseball, potato guns, and an ad-lib by Casey Affleck that made me laugh the rest of the picture.  \"Desert Blue\" could have worked better if Freeman would have lit a fire under the plot.  Too many scenes include drunken ramblings, proof that a film isn't trying.  While I came out of the film with a good feeling about it, I wished the movie could've taken more advantage of it's possibilities.  ------- 6"]},

One particular aspect of her life I appreciated as portrayed in the movie, was the importance of faith and family to the entire extended Mandrell family.", "Produced 1997, it coincided with Mandrell's retirement from performing.

No question about it, plot is unadventurous and outcome is hardly in the realms of the twisty surprise. But dialogue and character interactions are sharp and vital, often cutting and witty. The actors are ever watchable (especially Gleeson and Caffrey), while the fact that the story focuses on a different Ireland to the one that's often tainted by \"The Troubles\", gives the film a freshness that off sets the standard buddy buddy road movie formula of the plot.", "Director Breathnach goes for the slow burn approach, choosing to let McPherson's script dominate the picture. Yes there's some action, and good sequences flit in and out of the narrative, but the director is mostly about letting his characters breath, fully forming them with each passage of play during the guy's journey/mission. Even a sex scene is deftly slotted in and comes out as tasteful and a further expansion on the character of Git Hynes. It's thoughtful film making as regards being a character driven piece. There's a most interesting side issue involving the women in Git's and Bunny's lives, two men just about traversing the path on the wrong side of the law, both with gal trouble that gnaws away at their masculinity.", "It's not the Irish Midnight Run, as I was personally led to believe it was, and any expectation of a violent fun fest will only lead to disappointment. But it has many virtues to make it a safe recommendation to those that enjoy crisp and intelligent dialogue and fully formed characterisations. Nice photography, too. 7/10"]},

However, \"I'll Build It Myself\" is an inferior film in most ways. Much of it is because of the inclusion of Florence Lake and her obnoxious family, as they got in the way of Kennedy being stupid and making mistakes. In other words, the focus of the the latter film is more on the in-laws and this tended to make the humor more forced and more like just another Kennedy/Lake outing.

I was quite impressed by the way it started though. It has the main character trying to escape from a prison and getting caught only to be told he was being tested for a mission. He and a train load of other misfits are to be sent to a space colony to kill everyone. The introductions to the characters automatically tell you what they're like. Theres Koosman, a pilot. Goodis, a dumb acrobatic who is great small range. Cutter, a rapist and killer. Po, a huge black guy who killed loads of people and so on. There are more but I'd take forever explaining them. They all arrive on the space port anyway and find that everyone has been butchered and mutilated by an animal or something. Is it Bigfoot? Is it the Loch Ness Monster? No. It's just the usual alien monster cover up type thing but its fun to guess WHO it is. An adult Corey Feldman and 80's pop idol Rick Springfield give good performances and make it quite suspenseful. It just turns into a rip-off of Predator at the end though. Quite bloody, good fight scenes and a good monster make it worthwhile too. Overall the good and bad points it gets a 6 out of 10. Now go and find it!"]},

This was the first film I shot in 35MM film. All my previous efforts had been shot in 16MM. I saw this film recently, along with 18 or 19 other pictures that I made in the Seventies, as part of the process of revisiting the work I did back then. Some of the films I watched were dreadful. Some were acceptable on some level, especially considering their budgets, and some were quite watchable. Midnight Desires was by far the best of this group. Because of budgetary constraints I liked working with scripts that contained vignettes tied together by a central core. Shooting to this structure was much more cost effective than a linear story line where you moved from a to b to c to d, all the way to z, each scene depending on it's preceding and following scenes in order to make sense. In Midnight Desires four well dressed adults gather around the fire place in a Long Island mansion and each one reveals a long hidden, and as yet untold sexual fantasy. Each vignette takes us to a remote location where that fantasy is dramatized. At the end of each fantasy episode we return to the mansion where the complexities of the fantasy are discussed by the participants. Four stories. Four totally different sexual fantasies. Four explanations. At dawn a limo picks up one of the couples for the drive back to Manhattan and the film comes to its end. This picture was nicely shot by Bill Markle in his first 35MM effort. The locations are tangy. The dialogue is crisp and intelligent. The actors provide acceptable performances. The music, all stolen of course, is delicious. This is a clean, nimble, tidy, watchable movie. Very good of its kind."]},

In the first  half of the feature, Tom and Huck (\"Hucki\" in this version) witness Injun Joe rob  and kill a traveler, and come to the defense of the wrongly-accused town drunk.   The second, more engaging portion of the story, centers around Tom and Becky Thatcher discovering Injun Joe's treasure stash while lost inside a  deep system  of caverns.  Tom and Huck return the loot to the grateful townspeople, and Injun  Joe meets his fate when his partners in crime come for their share.  Production  value is adequate, though noticeably low budget (lots of people wear holsters without guns) and the picture is rife with continuity errors.  The score by Vladimir  Cosma is quite pleasant.", " This film, as well as Aventurile lui Tom Sawyer, played in a retrospective of  Romanian children's films in Bucharest in November 2003.

The clearest example of this for me is THE NAUGHTY SHUTTER, a 1963 theatrical release of such amateur technique and poor quality that it makes today's You Tube (and yesterday's home movies) seem professional by comparison.", "Be warned that this was made in the Silent Film tradition, as so much 1960s soft porn was executed, with an annoying hayseed voice-over narration by the reporter protagonist filling in as many blanks, and at times even making fun of the idiotic \"action\" on-screen, as possible. The film is so cheap that even its topical Nudist Camp theme is reduced to off-season \"Wintertime\" sunbathers, who hang out nude under heat lamps in one of the hotel rooms, or wander around naked in the corridors -no exterior shots! The film's content would barely fill out a Mack Sennett short circa 1913, and the aptly named director Sammy Helm's lack of understanding of film technique seems to predate Georges Melies. Basically the unattractive cast motion for the camera the way kids & neighbors do in backyard home movies, and the SW DVD ran an interminable 53 minutes of repeated filler, notably each cast member rummaging through garbage cans in search of a missing camera. Even so notable a genius at the exact opposite of the film-making talent spectrum, Stanley Kubrick, realized in moving from preview to final release version of his classic 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY that repetition for effect is not always wise (witness his famous excising of several scenes of the Gary Lockwood character that were adequately handled in the final version of the film by similar footage of Keir Dullea -designed to show the repetitive tedium of daily activities on the spacecraft). Tedium is the name of the game here.", "Even in seemingly intentionally crappy films like this (the SW-revived THE PEEK SNATCHERS comes to mind as a similar stinker), sometimes the basic premise is interesting or mildly diverting. Here, the idiots who concocted this storyline come off as especially braindead: the camera that is the center of attention takes polaroids of clothed people, resulting in magically nude photos -so far so good, but later the same camera pointed at members of a nude sun worshipers association supposedly creates images of them with clothes on (not shown, however), a completely illogical concept -it is one thing to suspend disbelief and imagine the camera making something disappear (in the manner of Superman or an airport Homeland Security attendant delivering an X-Ray vision image), but how does a mechanical photography device create the fabric not present on a nude woman? Thank God I was too young to get stung sitting through so-called \"Adult\" movies like this in the early '60s - I can only imagine how irritated the poor audience felt at this insult. The only element in the entire film that strikes some sort of chord is a serendipitous segment of 3 of the female nudists playing with an Undertaker's coffin, one lying inside, and the others holding candles in some makeshift ritual; this sort of sex/nudity/coffins motif keeps popping up in '60s softcore films for no logical reason, which I can only speculate is related to an ongoing interest in satanic rituals."]},

It does not deliver. Instead it is fairly tame by X-rated standards. \nThe main reason for watching \"Niccole\" is to see Suzanne Fields (credited as Sandra Dean) who's main claim to fame is a (non-sex) starring role in Flesh Gordon. She has also acted in several non-sex roles & fully participated in other X-rated films including with John Holmes in \"Around the World with John \"The Wadd\" Holmes, a major X production of the 1970's. \nThis film is basically a six scene porn with a minor plotline. The story of 'O' (the book) is basically only borrowed slightly as a plotline. There is some bondage and spanking but fairly brief and hardly graphic in nature. Suzanne Fields plays the part of Niccole. She narrates (besides her performance) between scenes which helps to connect the scenes and maintain the plot & her character. There is actual dialogue by others in the cast. \nIt should be noted, this film is never included in lists of movies based on \"The story if 'O'\" book. There are several other softcore & hardcore movies based on the book with Gerard Damiano's \"The Story of Joanna\" the best known for X-rated.\nBe aware if you look to purchase a copy of this film, the picture quality is not very good. It was filmed on a budget that did not include quality cameras or film. Available prints which were used for video or DVD are heavily degraded decreasing picture quality further. \nThis is worth watching for Suzanne Fields fans or that are interested or curious on bondage films of the early 1970's.

Chubby, amiable rural barkeep hands customer Jerry Butler a series of tall tales about the local Blair Mansion, not haunted but notorious for the sex-crazed family that lived there through three generations. ", "Embedded monochrome flashbacks within flashbacks illustrate his stories, beginning with the partriarch Eric Edwards, working in tandem with wife Honey Wilder in the Victorian era; then daughter Sharon Mitchell running a brothel in the house during the Depression, and finally grand-daughter Sharon Kane as a vocalist with a band using the home as a music studio. Present day it's turned into a convent of sort for cloistered nuns, but oddly enough Damiano doesn't show that incarnation at all. Film ends cryptically with Butler in a phone booth making a mysterious phone call, apparently taking these b.s. stories as intel for some project he's working on.", "After the ending we are treated to a brief, cute, fictional \"behind-the-scenes\" vignette where Damiano impersonates himself giving Candida Royalle direction on some future movie - removing the fourth wall. I recall hating this finale when I first saw the film three decades ago.", "At times HUNGER conjures up the best of Damiano's work as in MISS JONES and MISS AGGIE a decade before, with purple-prose dialog (often unsettling in its explicitness) and pushing the boundaries performances by the leading actors. Edwards as papa Blair has the affliction of satyriasis which he hands down to his offspring in the form of nymphomania. The seriousness with which Damiano treats this topic is amazing, and the three talented actors give performances that, just like Georgina Spelvin as Miss Jones, deserve to be studied and admired by mainstream thesps. ", "Mitch is the most definitive, and one of her career highlights, while Kane has a field day, incorporating a split personality (named respectively Slut Pig and MaryLou) enacted via CCTV for the alter ego, insatiable sexuality and even singing a song, as well as incorporating quite amusing stream of consciousness cultural references.", "The team of Edwards and Wilder is less adventurous, but quite polished in presenting Victorian personages that are believable rather than quaint.", "Verging on high camp at times, based on Damiano's often over-the-top dialog, film's greatest asset qualifies it for my recently concocted Jazz Porn genre, with Eric Bouchet's varied keyboards musical score constantly changing to fit the scene and always invigorating -virtually a classic underscore that deserves separate recognition.", "Like Orson Welles, Damiano's later career has been largely ignored, but films like this one plus his better-known video work like ALPHA BLUE, cry out for consideration. It is unfortunate that the most prominent archival video companies of the past two decades have focused on porno hacks instead of key figures like him, giving a highly misleading presentation of the genre's history (currently Stevens and Tobalina are all the rage with their assembly-line junkers)."]},

She explains how important body language is (especially in seduction) and lectures Tina on how to carry herself. It's a strong performance by the strikingly beautiful actress Ariana, and she is amusing in managing to name-drop such disparate celebrities as Theda Bara, Madonna and Katharine Hepburn (quite a trifecta) to make her points.", "Victoria Andrews also plays herself in a role near the end of her brief porn career. She lectures and demos the art of aromatherapy to Tyler, stressing how important one's natural scent can be in creating a sexual mood. After pouring samples of key ingredients like rosemary into the bath, she and Tyler take a plunge together and she treats Tina to a watery shoulder massage. The scene effortlessly segues to lesbian sex, highly sensual and very effective in what emerges as the New Age segment of the movie.", "As the title suggests, the show climaxes with Tina lighting candles and welcoming boyfriend Jon Dough, who is quite impressed (along with the audience) with her magnificent new look. She does the tutored striptease for him, moves on to masturbation and seamlessly morphs into a XXX encounter that ends the movie on a high note.", "Rather than compare \"Night of Seduction\" to the thousands of mediocre sex films of the VHS era, I would place it in a time capsule, enshrined as a prime example of what Adult Cinema could have been had it not lost its way in a stupid quest to be the raunchiest, sleaziest -choose your own adjective."]},

It's a lot better than what passes for soft porn nightly on pay-cable (esp. Cinemax) so many years later.", "Now there might exist a hardcore version of MILLION DOLLAR MONA, but for once, who cares? Its qualities derive from a creativity born out of self-censorship -instead of gynecological closeups of women's privates and extreme closeups that make penises look like John Dykstra space ship models, this film focuses on feminine beauty of the secondary sexual characteristics, and convincing simulation of ecstasy.

Who's to say which approach is correct? ", "The odd gimmick here, one which Costello never indulged in, is to recruit a familiar cast of hardcore performers and have them staged and photographed in strictly softcore content. There's no danger of explicit penetration or a money shot appearing on screen, but like several of Joe Sarno's self-touted exercises, it appears the actors are actually \"getting it on\" at times, even though we're not allowed to see it. Davis scrupulously avoids any closeups during the sex scenes, relying upon unedited (read: CHEAP), real-time theatrical stagings and aloof camera, but one keeps expecting a XXX payoff. Like most porn, this movie could easily have been spiced up by post-production (or even years later) addition of hardcore insert closeups, but the SWV DVD-R reissue plays integrally as 100% soft.", "\"DOLL\" is a showcase for Cleo O'Hara, a porn actress who was only given a chance to shine in several of Davis's films. She plays over-the-hill Hollywood actress Gaye Ramon, now giving acting lessons out of her home (alleged by the SWV notes to be Davis's actual home). With her lipstick smeared unattractively throughout the film, she is clearly less a Gloria Swanson (SUNSET BLVD.) or Bette Davis (BABY JANE) than a Sylvia Miles, fresh from Morrissey's classic HEAT. I saw Miles on stage in \"It's Me, Sylvia\" during the '80s, and that one-woman play is also in exactly the same vein as \"DOLL\".", "O'Hara's improvised dialog is extremely well done, and the film suffers (and falls to earth with a thud) whenever she isn't on screen camping it up and dominating the frame. Davis's conceit here is that she isn't merely another self-deluded diva bitter about aging and falling from starry heights of yesteryear, but frankly an admitted whore, constantly proud of her former status as \"the best c**ksucker in Hollywood\". The subtext that resonated with me was obvious but effective: both O'Hara and Davis are talents who clearly never got even a remote chance to strut their stuff in a \"real\" Hollywood movie. I would have loved to see them do a semi-straight biopic on Tallulah Bankhead, for example.", "Another talented comedian is on display, Keith Erickson as director Rodney Lecoq. With a truly phony wig hiding his famously receding hairline, Erickson camps it up in Taylor Mead fashion, and proves a great foil for Cleo. At one point he reveals a huge erection on camera, the closest to hardcore for \"DOLL\".", "The rest of the cast seems hamstrung by the softcore structure, causing one to infer that the film would have been better simply shot hardcore. Sandy Carey is virtually unrecognizable in a red wig, upstaged by pal Andy Bellamy's big, pointy breasts sticking out, while the team of lovely Jill Sweete and boy friend Billy Lane are extremely dull when left adrift to ad lib consistently boring, ho-hum conversation. In a real film their desultory scenes would be dropped, and Lane would probably have been replaced altogether, given that his scenes opposite Cleo are completely carried by her (he's a blank).", "Ultimately, burdened with a boring non-ending of the \"life goes on\" variety, \"DOLL\" emerges as a coulda, shoulda been a contender. Alongside Davis's notorious horror/porn THE DEMON IN MISS JONES, it's still in search of its cult."]},

The film at one point follows the creepiest-looking gangster (Flavio Bucci from the \"The Night Train Murders\") to his home where he is shacking up with another gangster's wife and her kid, but more than character development this seems to be more an excuse for another sex scene. The Placido character has an interesting flashback of him working on a filthy fishing barge, which is contrasted with a fantasy where he is piloting a yacht. This movie is very class-conscious in the way it has this poor Sicilian boy falling for a rich, northern girl (the Italian title \"La Orca\" comes from the designer outfit she's wearing). Placido is pretty good here, but this handsome, light-complexioned hunk is not too convincing as a lower-class Sicilian ruffian. As for Neihaus, I can't decide if she is a bad actress, or is just playing a really obnoxious character (she's more Paris Hilton than Patty Hearst). She does get naked several times which, judging from the English, title was the primary consideration.", "This movie has a bit of a bad reputation, but I don't know why. It's not nearly as brutal as similarly-themed American films like \"Date with a Kidnapper\" or \"The Candy Snatchers\". I believe Niehaus' character is underage, but the actress obviously wasn't (she'd been in \"Playboy\" two years earlier). Maybe it offended people that the victim is made so unsympathetic, but that doesn't explain why she returns in a sequel. . . I dunno. Check it out for yourself and see what you think."]},

He sneaks off to make it with his more liberated girlfriend Betty (Jean Dalton), while the horny Miss Evans manages to talk Sue into a bit of sapphic action after school - I guess since she's a chick it doesn't count? Bill keeps pressuring Sue to no avail, though once the two appear to be on the outs, a fateful encounter with Stinger and Betty might just change her mind. Will Sue finally give in to her urges and give her classmates what they've been lusting after ONCE... AND FOR ALL?", "Well duh. Even for a porn movie, though, ONCE is pretty shaky in terms of story. It less has a narrative than backs into one, with the first two-thirds of the film filled out with an excess of random encounters - the whole character of Miss Evans could be cleanly lopped out and nothing would be missed but some sex. You may profess that that's the point, but I'd still rather watch a porn film that didn't insult my intelligence. Marlow, a consummate professional, at least provides expert cocksmanship, while Dell and Davis, both with much shorter resumes, perform merely adequately, making it clear why Marlow became the genre mainstay. Distaff counterparts Houston and Dalton are about the same - just okay - while Ultramax, another fixture of shoddy New York porn, hams it up at about a 5 of 10 on her usual scale, seeming to suggest that really no one's heart was into making this thing.

A bunch of desperate drug-addicted drag queens and various hangers-on lurch through a night of debauchery in a night-club - while an HIV positive drag queen pontificates from far on the magic of gaydom.  If this film is intending to be an anti-gay film it succeeds admirably.  It makes our culture look drug-dependent, witless and boring.  One or two of the cast members have talent, but mostly they are pretty lousy.  Surprisingly it is quite well shot and seems to have had a decent budget - why then was money not spent on assembling a better cast and on writing a better script?"]},

I really love this series from MGM as they offer up fascinating stories even though they are mainly thrown at the conspiracy theorist inside me. This episode is yet another interesting case that I had never heard about but it does make for a good mystery, which is the entire point of the series. Frank McGlynn, Sr. plays Lincoln here, a role that he would play over ten times in his career including the 1924 film ABRAHAM LINCOLN, John Ford's THE PRISONER OF SHARK ISLAND and THE LITTLE REBEL.

His accidental death at the age of 42 deprived Latvian film of an incredible talent who would have been entering the prime of this career. His skill and talent combined to make a filmmaker who would be considered great not only in the context of Latvian film, but by any global cinematic standards. This is made even more extraordinary when taken in the context of where and when he made his films. Working under Soviet rule as a documentarian, a genre that demands clarity and truth under a government that provided neither, he managed to make singular films that withstand the test of time. Perhaps no other film exemplifies this better than \"Vai Viegli But Jaunam?\" (Is it Easy to be Young?). Released in 1986 the film played to packed houses across the Soviet Union and to critical accolades in the West. The film opens with rock concert footage spliced with coverage of the trial of several youths who were charged with the vandalism of a train at the conclusion of that concert. Podnieks contrasts the exuberance and implied rebel spirit of the concert with shots of the accused standing uncomfortably before those who would judge them. There is no question how this trial will turn out. It's a forgone conclusion. They don't stand a chance before these authoritarian figures who deliver the \"facts\" without passion or emotion and with an unwavering conviction of their \"right\" and \"righteousness.\" The accused don't even attempt to defend themselves, not as an admission of guilt, but with a hopeless resignation to their fate. The only one of them to even attempt to raise a defense is eventually sentenced to several years of hard labor. And so starts the exploration of whether it is easy to be young. Podnieks presents a variety of subjects in various settings providing us with a wide cross section of youths from various walks of life and divergent destinations. He creates a snapshot of time which not only captures the difficulties of growing up, but also of the Soviet Union as it was beginning to unravel under its own banality, hypocrisy and utter disregard for humanity. We meet an eager Krishna who seems to be rebelling against what he perceives as a corrupt society, but who does so by replacing one form of blind allegiance with another. Down with Lenin Up with Hari! We meet a young punk who is exceptionally articulate, intelligent and informed, but for all of that can't see beyond his own fatalistic nihilism. There's a young girl who failed in her suicide attempt being browbeaten by those who are supposed to cure her and a first time filmmaker who isn't sure of what he wants to say but knows that he needs to say something. All of them will seem familiar to those of us who can remember entering adulthood regardless of where and when we did so. But perhaps the most poignant moment in the film is the before and after interviews with young conscripts who were sent to Afghanistan. The contrasts are as shocking as those of the most cynical and broken combat veterans as seen in any documentary about war and its consequences. Watching a young veteran walking through a city filled with people on whose behalf he had believed to be fighting and in defense of a system and ideals that he no longer can share is as powerful of an image as I've seen on film. Podnieks greatest strength is in getting these individuals to reveal so much of their selves. We get the feeling as if we are sitting in on a late night conversation between friends where they let down their guard and reveal their true selves and feelings. Even more extraordinary is that Podnieks got them to do so in a time and a place where public introspection of this kind often had severe consequences. A place where thinking the wrong thing was considered to be as bad, if not more so, as doing the wrong thing. The film's greatest strength is in the way that it shows what it means to \"grow up,\" and answering the title question with: It never is, nor should it ever be."]},

In 1995 he decided to try and catch up with the lives of the other people born in the city on the same day. The result is a film that captures the daily lives of a collection of people.", "This film has won awards and was considered to be quite the darling of the European festival circuit back when it was released (although I only have the internet to believe for that \"fact\"). Despite this I am the first person to write a review on it for this site and I must admit that the temptation is to write a pretentious and glowing review of it because it is a Russian documentary that is real and gritty and has clear artistic intentions  to write such a review would mark me out as a man of clear taste who seeks out little-seen foreign films. It would also mark me out as a fraud because this is not how I feel about the film and I could care less if my opinion leaves me open to higher minds telling me that I \"didn't get it\".", "What I saw in the film was the potential to draw together an understanding in the casual viewer of what life is like in this part of Russia as lived by a diverse group of people who only happen to have the connection of being born in the same city on the same day. However in delivery we do not really get that but rather we get a slight glance at the lives of this group of people without a great deal of expansion or thematic extension beyond what they are doing or saying when the camera is on them. This produces some moments of interest and Kosakovsky is not afraid to get right up close to the reality he is shooting (I had to look away from the graphic birth scenes) but the problem is that so much of reality is dull  we all know this because all of us life with some degree of it. Too much of the film is like this though and it offers the viewer almost nothing as if Kosakovsky was out to deliver reality whether it made for interesting viewing or not.", "Overall then this is a weak film in my view. It was occasionally interesting and I suppose it does offer a real view of the mundane detail of life in Russia but this is not much of a selling point and I suspect many viewers will be left as uninformed about the bigger picture as they were at the start and only a feeling of boredom to show for it."]},

Blackjack is along the line of \"Do you think we can fit one more subplot to the other 7000 ones, Let's see how it works!\" There is of course the color phobia, Lundgren being a new parent, the homoeroticism between Lundgren and Rubinek, the supermodel and her psycho ex,The bad guy being a failed actor, the supermodel addicted to prescription drugs, his best friend's injury, the friend's company which is taken over, the parents of the little girl who die under mysterious circumstances, Lundgren's shrink and Lundgren's tragic past. That is like five more subplots than the movie needs and really Woo cannot make it work, especially when there is too much going on. Still Blackjack has it's moments.

The idea is okay, but the leads are very irritating and they talk way too much which only makes their lousy acting skills more clear. The gore highlights are quite memorable, including a pleasantly deranged \"This Little Piggy...\"- game and of course the absurd baby-killing sequence.

They did take advantage of the opportunity with an intro and the thing I mention to in the summary, if neither really add to the whole in any meaningful way, and the opening bit, with the knowledge we have now, makes it sad if you stop to think about it. If you don't know, this is a variety show. They would perform this many nights. It keeps to an immense pace, for the nearly 80 minutes of running time. The many famous names(like Daimi) from back then perform really well, and they must have had just enough time to change costumes between the tons of largely short bits. It is over the top much of the time(it is a stage production, after all); with that said, a lot of it is genuinely funny(and Passer as a Russian clown is really good). There are jokes about typical everyday stuff and family life, silly ones, cleverness, wordplay and some raunchy or otherwise crude(it is mainly light and inoffensive) and a *ton* of references. There are sketches, singing(pop music, ridiculously catchy tunes) and a few running gags. This has dancing and half-naked women, too. There's something for everyone, and the amount of material that holds up today(taxes!) is impressive. The DVD comes with subtitles and four trailers for other Danish productions from the period.

This here gets right down to business with the fact that there's a good start here giving away the strong opening in the caves where the ceremony takes place as well as the vampires' encounter at his followers house which is a great cheese-filled sequence by itself that is all the more fun for being the opening of the film.

Even with this cheese, there's some rather fine moments that really undermine the cheesiness aspect of this one which occur at a few places here, from the somewhat chilling attack at the house where the guard finds the source of a disturbance while out on patrol to be one of the zombie henchwomen and begins retreating as she backs him up to the opposite side of the yard in a really well-done sequence that's quite suspenseful than expected, while the two big action scenes here in the second half come off rather nicely here with the first ambush in their cave hide-out makes for a rather enjoyable series of action set-pieces spread throughout the base before the villains make their getaway leading into the big finale in the high-rise building that's quite fun and enjoyable ending this with a nice bang. Coupled with a stellar pace that never really lets the film drag on despite the several subplots running along at the same time it's quite a fun and wholly enjoyable time here with these providing enough to like against the few flaws on display. The film's biggest issue here is the fact that there's never any real solid information given about why these particular groups are after each other, for there's a big rivalry between these two that's brought up out of the blue as they begin fighting over the invention no real reason. This really could've made mention of a past duel between them that's carried over here over the specific formula, but there's nothing given here which really causes this to feel very shortsighted and quite rushed. As well, the fact this one seems to go to great lengths at incorporating the police's investigation into the two in the second half by showcasing their efforts to recapture the stolen formula but they still seem like such afterthoughts at that point it's hard to wonder why they were even included at that stage as they visually don't do anything to warrant them being present.

In the dream her husband gets tired of their high mortgage and land taxes so he decides to make their house fly so that they can save money. For the rest of the film we see the two flying around in their house trying to find a cheap and safe place to live. I think the idea behind this film was much better than the actual execution. There's no doubt that the animation is top-notch as McCay never had a problem getting interesting visuals on the screen. There are many great ones here including the entire bit where the house takes off and begins to fly over various locations so that the husband can find one he likes. There's also some very good stuff in outer space that looks terrific. With that said, the majority of what we see just doesn't have any sort of emotion behind it. There's really no laughs, no drama or anything else. Everything is pretty much flat in regards to any type of entertainment coming from the actual story. McCay fans will probably still want to watch it but there's no question that it doesn't rank among his best films."]},

This dream here just happens to take him to a circus where various bugs do tricks on the stage. I'd be lying if I said this here was among McCay's best works because it's certainly no where near that. It certainly falls well short of his earliest films but overall this here isn't too bad and fans of his should still want to check it out. The one thing lacking was an overall passion from the film. I didn't think the material was nearly as lively as it should have been and this includes scenes that are just rather flat and don't contain any laughs or charm. I think this might be due to the fact that everything we're seeing is pretty much just repeating itself. We see a bug doing a trick and then we get to the next bug who just does another trick. The animation itself is quite good and it's clear that it came a long way since McCay's first film ten years earlier."]},

Desperate to prevent her becoming president, James convinces injured jock Paul to run, prompting Paul's love-scorned sister to also stand. Where once the presidency was a good clean-cut race, Tracey takes the competition badly, and it descends into something a lot more sinister.", "I wasn't totally sure about this film but I had heard good things about it and, even though the fact that it was an MTV Production put me off a bit, I decided to give it a try. The film is quite clever for the most part and takes the worn genre and clichés of high school movies and makes them into a quite good little political satire of sorts  albeit one that is rather downbeat at times. The comedy is not laugh out loud funny and maybe that's a problem, but I enjoyed the parallels with modern politics (and sexual issues) and found it to make some good points in a funny way. Of course the end is rather downbeat but only because it is sadly believable.", "I must say that I was rather put off by a couple of different things. The first was the amount of sexual material in the film  not a real problem but I was a little put off by how graphically the subject of underage sex was dealt with. This was a minor problem (if you can pardon the pun!) but what I found a little worrying was Payne's apparent misogynistic touch on the film  all the men were hapless saps and the women held the real power all the way; I'm not saying this is not true but Payne has little sympathy for his female characters and they may come off better overall but there is no love lost for them.", "The cast opens with an amusing bit of role reversal that sees everyone's favourite high school student become a teacher in the shape of Matthew Broderick. Hardly having the best run of roles for a while, he is actually pretty good here even if some of what happens to his character doesn't seem to fit very well. Witherspoon is annoying but the difference here is that it is intentional! She easily fits into the character and her role has a great touch to it  I'm not saying it is easy to enjoy her performance but she is good. Klein does his usual dumb jock thing but is fortunate that he has the material to support (this time) but I felt Campbell was left with a sympathetic character that was placed on the sidelines too much.", "Overall I enjoyed this film but it had its limitations. It isn't hilariously funny as many coming to this genre may expect but it is quite cleverly written. The story struggles a bit as it goes along, with threads left hanging that stop it being as tight as it maybe could have been but generally I enjoyed it but can see why some others have problems with it."]},

They make contact with and simultaneously fall foul of their near neighbour the landowner and his wife and daughter who have some serious problems developing in relation to a relation who is being chased by a manic blackmailer Herbert Lomas. Unflappable wife Marie Lohr takes every ridiculous turn in events in her stride in the same way she did later as Professor Higgins mother in Pygmalion and provides an anchor to the main characters nuttiness. Apart from Walls himself the landowner Hubert Harben has a couple of great lines in here, the best complaining of Walls & Lynn's \"rank savagery\" after being warned they'd \"hang his hide on the doorpost\". The scene where 52 year old Walls is trying to bed - no better word for it – the 24 year old Veronica Rose playing the distressed Diana is borderline embarrassing for his continually thwarted hopes, in this case it's just too drawn out and almost ruined the whole film for me. Robertson \"pardon my effrontery\" Hare played Walls' badly used secretary with his usual endless supply of serious fortitude in the face of such eccentric hostility, even to being threatened at one stage with a \"scalping\" by his employer.", "It has many good almost classic moments of fun, farce and bizarre verbal exchanges throughout but the last few minutes tapered off into laboured slapstick which possibly only attempted to verify the satirical title. I suspect most people would have a real fight on their hands if they come to this cold - I enjoyed it and like to see it again every so often, but then again I've always appreciated this lost art form."]},

But, for all those beyond puberty you will enjoy this sweet, sensitive movie about getting old and being married. It moves at a slower pace than a younger audience can handle. The music is from the 40's and sets the tone of the piece as a bevy of excellent older character actors go through the emotions of a long time couple looking back at their lives and wondering if they are happily married after all these years.", "I think this movie should be required watching for anyone getting married. The children from the family also look at their own lives as they watch what their parents are going through and wonder, should they also be re considering their own situation.", "I watched this to see some real old pros at work again together and I was not disappointed. I haven't seen Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara (Ben Stiller's parents for those that don't remember them) together in many years. Add in the wonderful Doris Roberts and the then young upcoming actor Mark Ruffalo and you have a nice round cast. If you decide to watch it without high expectations you will have a nice surprise."]},

I'm really not sure how much of this film is actually lost and how much of it just never got completed. There are several bits of footage with a sign showing \"Argument 2\" or \"Argument 3\" where I'm guessing footage was supposed to either have been added or perhaps this is just some that is lost. Either way, one at least gets a very good idea of what the film was going for, which was just Flip doing various tricks with the dinosaur. As you'd expect, the animation was quite good throughout and I thought the character of Flip was nice and strong enough to carry you through the movie. The dinosaur was clearly modeled after Gertie and looks good as well. Fans of McCay will certainly want to check it out as well as those interested in this eras animation."]},

Then we move to a café where the discussion proper begins with the great \"New Wave\" critic Serge Danay questioning Rivette about faces and bodies -- the reason that he was invited to the Fautrier exhibit being that the filmmakers saw a link between painter and director in this area. Most of the next two hours proceeds with Danay attempting to elicit interesting responses from Rivette on a variety of topics and themes: the beginning of the New Wave, his childhood, language and literature, Paris, architecture, acting, and most of all, the joys of filmgoing and criticism. This is an exceptionally well-done and involving documentary that shifts between various types of locales within Paris, mirroring Rivette's own fictional explorations of the city....it never quite gets to the depths, the heart and soul of this great filmmaker, but that's OK: we are constantly reminded of how private and solitary an individual Rivette is. No doubt my high rating reflects both my passion for the director's work and the resonance I feel with his solitary intellectual (largely self-taught) lifestyle, but I think that anyone genuinely interested in the Nouvelle Vague who has seen a couple of films by the subject will get something out of this nicely-shot and minimally edited film. Scenes from several of the director's works are included, all rarely scene outside of (maybe in?) France, the longest and most fascinating being from Duelle and L'amour fou.

To solve the problem Wang buys an 8 year old orphan. His happiness turns into dejection, when he finds out that \"the boy\" actually is a girl. Despite his displeasure he keeps the girl and trains her as an acrobat. One evening he takes her to a performance of the opera \"Attaining Nirvana\". There Master Liang plays a princess, who hangs from the ceiling by a rope, which she threatens to cut if the officers don't stop the execution of her father, the emperor. Some days later the girl rescues a 4 year old boy from his confinement by some child-traders. Believing he is an orphan, she brings him to Wang, who she knows is longing for a male inheritor. But the boy is actually kidnapped from a wealthy family, and soon Wang is accused of the robbery and sentenced to death. To persuade Master Liang to help her rescue Wang, the girl climbs the roof of the opera house, ties a rope around her leg and hangs to it from the ceiling. She threatens to cut the rope, and when she actually does this, Master Liang throws himself forward and catches her. He is moved by her action and decides to do whatever he can to help the girl rescue Wang."]},

Credits are mainly crude pseudonyms, though Knight is listed on-screen.", "Plot hook is very cornball -the porno staple of a girl answering an ad for participation in an \"experimental movie\", and later ruing her own naiveté. This sort of ploy dates back to the exploitation films of the 1930s, with the girl from a small town answering a \"no experience necessary\" ad, coming to the big town and falling prey to white slavery/bondage, as in Elmer Clifton's still watchable \"Slaves in Bondage\".", "Attractive porn mainstay Tina Russell is the stupido in question, egged on by her leech of a boyfriend Jason Russell, who digs the idea of her earning a fast $250 a day. She arrives at a private mansion, and when she balks at the downright mistreatment by \"genius\" film director Tom (actor's identity is a pseudonym, and I'm hoping that it was really Sidney Knight in the role), she is kept prisoner for the duration of filming at gunpoint.", "The plot twists here are thoroughly unbelievable, just functioning to keep the porn pot boiling and to amuse both jaded and perverted fans (I would like to plead guilty to the former attribute, please). Tom's shrink Dr. Clayton gives Tina a phony song & dance to help keep her on board, and later on boyfriend Jason is convinced by Tom to move into the mansion too as an assistant, with obvious ulterior motives. A maid and butler are on hand to join in the sex.", "What makes this nonsense interesting is the reliance, Warhol/Morrissey style, on baiting dialog. Anyone who's ever been to a job interview where the professional tries to get a rise out of you knows the routine, and it is executed here with a nastiness that is breathtaking. As Tom, the guy credited as \"Claude Rube\" is so mean to Tina that one wishes for Gloria Steinem to barge onto the set and make a citizen's arrest. As with some of the best Warhol efforts, e.g. \"I, A Man\", this baiting goes beyond the character to impinge on the actress and I, for one, felt that Tina was being mightily mistreated here. But that dovetails exactly with the film's theme -exploiting of would-be actresses, and in a moebius way a self-indictment of the filmmakers themselves- Knight and company are the title Debauchers.", "This is rough stuff, segueing to a snuff film final reel with some cruel twists that have to be seen to be believed. Tom's final line \"you gave me just what I wanted\" at the film's open ending is chilling.", "Casting is most of the battle in this genre, and Knight is blessed by the unrelenting creepiness of his surrogate on screen, the villain Rube, who is one horrible hothead. Infant terrible doesn't begin to describe this role, and the Rubemeister does it justice. An uncredited Frank Darlin as the shrink is a slimy old guy who really got on my nerves with his snake-oil talk to Tina. I was frankly shocked when the old buzzard finagled her into giving him a blow job and more later in the film -presumably some old geezers in 1972 got a kick out of this but it is a sight that makes for sore eyes.", "You can't help but feel sorry for Tina while watching this, especially since it mirrors her own career trajectory. Real-life hubby Jason is suitably sleazy and unsympathetic as the money-hungry boyfriend: it's amazing how many of these male hangers-on we've seen in film history from the Ric Lutze & Murrill Maglio types in porn to John Derek as Svengali to the ultimate MILF magnet of yore, Robert Wolders."]},

It has been done, either similarly or nearly identical more than once beforehand elsewhere, such as the Daffy Duck cartoon 'Quackodile Tears' (which is not a classic but has always been enjoyable to me despite the overbearing wife character), though similarities are not blatant. It is also a premise that can/could go either way, it could have been cute and amusing or it could have been too cheesy and too sugary.", "'Mud Squad' is a bit of both and actually on first watch it was better than expected, something that stayed on rewatch. As far as the Tijuana Toads cartoons go, it is in the better end as it at least had amusing moments and didn't annoy me. Is it a particularly good cartoon? No. Is it watchable? Yes. Despite not caring overall for the Tijuana Toads series, none of the 17 cartoons in it are irredeemably bad in my view. Something that 'Mud Squad' most certainly is not.", "Shall start with the good things. The baby alligator character Georgie is just adorable and is also surprisingly feisty, his treatment of the toads is quite amusing. The ending is the highlight and it was not expected either. The music is character filled and vibrant, with a great main theme.", "Pacing is lively, it is cute without being too cutesy and there are more gags than what can be usually seen in the series, and ones not too badly executed.", "None though are quite hilarious. Most are also predictable from having been done before elsewhere so the outcomes are never in question (not helped by that the series is already quite formulaic), a variation of the rocket gag for example was even seen in 'Never On Thirsty'. The story has energy but is very thin and derivative, couldn't help be reminded of 'Quackodile Tears' at some points.", "Also felt that some of 'Mud Squad' is quite repetitive, not unusual for the Tijuana Toads series, which would have been solved with more material and more variety in it. The mother alligator is another very annoying and overbearing character that is reduced to very old material, thankfully she is not in it much. Neither El Toro or Pancho are either interesting or funny, though El Toro actually has his moments like his first encounter with Georgie. The dialogue tends to be awkward and the animation badly lacks smoothness and is too simplistic.", "Concluding, watchable but fairly average. 5/10."]},

We are shown clips of salmon spawning, wild horses running, old fashion lo-glitz rodeo, Indians doing a tribal dance for show. In-between, there are men punching, flying, riding and shooting, and a really lame love story. Take it for what it's worth, I enjoyed it as a pre-dawn distraction from insomnia. I liked all the western plaid coats and handsome hair, but would've liked more pickup trucks."]},

Some of the most haunting moments includes also story of soldier, which received serious face injury and now must try to reconcile himself... The main storyline follows the story of two young Czech pilots - Student (falling to an unhappy romance with British radio-operator) and Prcek, both excellently acted (by remarkable talents Jiri Bednar and Jiri Hrzan). Music fits the whole film very well, featuring funny scene, where the famous tune \"Skoda lasky\" (originally Czech and in England known as \"Roll out the Barell\") is performed by the traveling soldiers in two languages...

Hill, a great actress of the era, is particularly convincing as the prudish undercover officer, who ends up having a crash course in sex with strangers in order not to blow her cover, and adds immeasurably to the story line's effectiveness and final twists.", "Madam of The Palace is Nici Sterling, magisterial with her British accent adding to her frequent narration, who is carrying a mighty torch for her lost love, Peter North. An unusual aspect of the film is that a lengthy flashback sex scene of North & Sterling is interspersed (accompanied by her voice-over) at many points in the tale, constituting an eleventh XXX scene -this and the ten integral sex bouts are a throwback to the Golden Age, diametrically opposed to 21st Century porn's insistence on stand-alone (for streaming/downloading separately) lengthy sex vignettes.", "Steven St. Croix runs the place, and is suspicious of the newbie couple (Jonathan and Melissa), but their uninhibited sex with each other and with brothel staff assuages both his and wary Sterling's fears. ", "Filmmaker Justin Sterling, using the moniker Michael Santangelo, wisely avoids the attempted action scenes or location hopping that most Adult Cinema used to adopt (think Private Media sub-par releases) in a vain effort to pretend to be a \"real film\". Instead, this period piece set during Prohibition has fabulous costumes (including vintage undergarments for the ladies), jewelry, hair styling, terrific jazz score and even classic cars to set the mood. As Sterling's character says as a riposte to an insult by Morgan on how easy it must be to set up a brothel, \"It takes artistic vision to create the right atmosphere\".", "Between the frequent gambling scenes, where winning a special silver or gold coin entitles the punter to a roll in the hay with a designated whore or gigolo on staff, the sex scenes are sensual and arousing, performed by a most able cast. Crystal Gold, the busty blonde bombshell back then, is terrific as an assistant to St. Croix, as is Felecia in her usual lesbian scene and the beautiful Madelyn Knight as fellow prostitute. Future superstar Stephanie Swift makes waves as a newbie hooker, and Sid Deuce's humping in a roadster as one of the lucky gamblers was worthy of excerpting into Ultimate Pictures' effective compilation film \"Outdoor Ecstacy\".", "Slowly unfolding with a charm all its own, \"The Palace of Pleasure\" is highly recommended to any fan of the erotic romanticism that A & E embodied two decades ago, and is no longer pursued by today's gonzo video folk."]},

A lot more effort than usual was expended on creating a professional, stylish narrative, with the two leads being well-drawn and winningly acted, a twisty story with a few zingers in the dialogue, and fine Cassavettes-like direction from nudie/roughie vet Frost (who went on to more \"legitimate\" titles later). Although, in comparison to other efforts in the genre, the sex and exploitation elements take a back seat here, the realistic context gives them a more intense edge than usual -- it'll remind you of all the times you spontaneously ended up in the sack with some sexy dame and lived to regret it. One particularly electrifying (I mean that literally) scene of torture is right out of Michael and Roberta Findlay's playbook.

The fact that they always managed to get hold of some of the biggest names in the business certainly didn't hurt matters either. What people often seem to forget about the Golden Age is that both the talent pool and number of films produced was but a minuscule fraction of what we have today. To put it bluntly, if performers wanted to put bread on the table, they couldn't afford being picky about the projects they appeared in. Not that the Lewis Brothers represented some kind of industry nadir, far from it. Their frugally produced features frequently looked as though they'd spent a budget several times bigger than they actually had thanks to their photography and editing skills.", "Their mainstream knockoff 8 TO 4 (take a wild guess !) may have been their most financially rewarding title but was somewhat overrated by both fans and critics alike at the time. Being a huge Veronica Hart fan, I would personally place TOUCH ME IN THE MORNING (taking its title from a syrupy Diana Ross ballad) at the top of my list. PLEASE MR POSTMAN and MEMPHIS CATHOUSE BLUES would share a close second place, well ahead of TRASHI, BRIEF AFFAIR and HER WICKED WAYS. I'm not even going to mention \"11\" or LADIES NIGHT ! The premise is simplicity itself. Overworked postal delivery person Barbara Cohen (Loni Sanders) barely has time for a quickie with fellow postie Jesse Adams, the guy on the boat with Sharon Kane in SMALL TOWN GIRLS, before both have to rush out for their daily delivery rounds. The letters and parcels they deposit provide the set-up for the various erotic episodes.", "When a freshly developed home movie turns out to be a porno loop (featuring, for the record, Phaery I. Burd, Anna Turner and an uncredited Shaun Costello), the action on screen is mirrored by Tigr and Lynx Canon (a/k/a \"Jean Damage\" from Fred Lincoln's SAME TIME, EVERY YEAR) in a tremendous Sapphic number. I particularly like Tigr acting all flabbergasted by the movie, effectively leading into Lynx's masterful seduction of her inexperienced girlfriend. Luscious Loni actively takes part next in the Nina Franks shrine sequence with Richard Pacheco as a doting fan mistakes her for a famous actress and requests her to model a lacy bit of lingerie she wore in \"her last film with Al Pacino\". Charming interaction and superb chemistry highlight this sparkling encounter that rightfully plays to the performers' strengths. While he's being all funny and nervous, tripping over his pants in excitement, she's adorable and giggly.", "Sorority sisters Misty Regan (star of John Christopher's VELVET HIGH) and rarely seen Sonya Sommers (who has thankfully discarded her braces since Gerard Damiano's NEVER SO DEEP) find a package full of sex toys delivered to their doorstep, courtesy of horny frat brothers Mike Horner, Blair Harris and Perry Mann (also in Juliet Anderson's pioneering video ALL THE KING'S LADIES) who naturally proceed to join in the fun. A lonely pervert  Milton Ingley (a/k/a \"Michael Morrison\") who seems to go for a heavy breathing Peter Lorre impersonation  makes a few phone calls from the ads in his dirty magazine and winds up with demure, white-wearing Erica Boyer (this Hall of Famer should need no introduction) and domineering, black-wearing Nicole Noir (Mata Hari in Edwin Brown's IRRESISTIBLE), the lucky sod ! By far the most outrageous scene has frustrated housewife Holly McCall, who won a Best Supporting Actress award for Sam Weston's NOTHING TO HIDE and does despair really well, trying to lure TV addicted husband Paul Thomas away from his favorite game show by impaling herself on a male blow-up doll ! Most unusual for a movie made in the early '80s, there's a preponderance of sex toys permeating almost every scene. Remember this was when they were still being referred to as \"marital aids\" and invariably credited to Doc Johnson. I've often deplored their use as a staple ingredient in girl/girl scenes, decrying the actresses' laziness when fingers and tongues would've done the job just as well, but here they're employed with an infectious curiosity by people still feeling their way who don't always seem to know exactly what to do with them. Call it the shock of the new or the joy of discovery but either way it works a treat.", "At one hour and 15 minutes, this snappily paced movie never wears out its welcome, juggling sex scenes with deftly executed bits of physical comedy as Loni and Jesse struggle to make their deliveries, scored with a brass band rendition of \"Oh, Suzanna\". It should also have great crossover appeal. The sex, which I would categorize as good-natured raunch, will satisfy the most hard-up of rain-coaters while the breezy and often surprisingly sophisticated humor could quite easily win over the couples crowd.

If you tackle the sexploitation genre then you're going to find a lot of films that deal with swinging or women out of control but this one here really stands out due to the wild dialogue from Wood. I'm going to go on the record by saying he was a great screenwriter because I've yet to see a film that features one of his screenplays that is ever boring. I've seen this same story in dozens of sexploitation pictures but Wood's wacky screenplay really makes the material fresh, entertaining and funny. It goes without saying that all of the performances are way below average but this does bring a certain documentary like quality to the film, which works well with the ugly cinematography. The soundtrack is laughable throughout but the story never gets boring. We get countless softcore sex scenes and plenty of nudity to keep things moving.

Like so many Golden Age filmmakers, he had his roots in '60s sexploitation cinema, producing Corey Allen's notorious EROTIC ADVENTURES OF PINOCCHIO. As a dirty movie director, he rarely showed much ambition beyond stringing together loops he had shot for the 8mm market – ah, those were the days ! – into makeshift \"features\" like FULFILMENT, BEYOND FULFILMENT (clever, huh ?) and SHEER PANTIES. With every rule, there are some exceptions though. The glossy, big budget rom com CHAMPAGNE FOR BREAKFAST with Lesllie Bovee and John Leslie was the one he clearly considered his Magnum Opus, signing with his real name in an industry known for (frequently stupid) pseudonyms. While shot on a much more modest scale, PURELY PHYSICAL proves to be its equal in every respect however, taking a hackneyed hardcore premise into a new and surprising direction.

The longest erotic encounter in the movie, it doesn't even begin to wear out its welcome. Bulky Milton Ingley (a/k/a \"Michael Morrison\") plays a good-natured traveling salesman who's also a big fan of old movies, a weakness fully taken advantage of by hardened hooker Tigr. Lonely business woman Juliet Anderson – still identified as \"Aunt Peg\" in the credits, a precaution surely superfluous at this stage of her distinguished career – finds her advances rebuffed by Lazare and settles for a scorching solo instead, a stunningly lit claw the sheets number that stands as one of the best of its kind. Down on his luck Joey Silvera receives a pair of sympathetic streetwalkers (Nicole Noir and Fay Burd) from a compassionate friend. This is one of those scenes – all too rare in adult – where, once you think you know where it's going, they throw you a curve-ball. Joey's too tired for both girls so decides to take on just one, which is when they reveal that they are in love with each other and can't bear to be apart. They subsequently draw the guy into their passionate lovemaking ever so gradually, to truly touching effect. The performers in the next sequence will probably seem alien to all but the most ardent aficionados.

In this film, Anthony Hulme plays Temple, but in the other three, Temple was played by John Bentley. This is a very good one. Of the four films, only three have been issued on video or DVD. The first and the last are both better than CALLING PAUL TEMPLE (1948, see my review), which is not as good, although it is notable for Dinah Sheridan playing 'Steve', one of her most renowned roles later on being the mother in THE RAILWAY CHILDREN (1970, see my review). (Dinah Sheridan's real name was Dinah Ginsburg, and her father was a Russian.) The story of this film deals with a ruthless gang of jewel thieves who frequently murder people when they carry out their robberies in England. It is realized that they follow a similar pattern to that of an earlier jewel thief gang in South Africa some years before, and that they must be led by the same man, whose true identity is not known, but who goes by the name of the Knave of Diamonds. One night watchman just before dying manages to say something about 'the green finger', which makes no sense to anyone, though its meaning later becomes very clear. There is a mysterious little woman called Miss Marchmont, played with verve by the character actress Beatrice Varley, whose true identity also turns out to be a surprise in the story. There is another mysterious name, 'the first penguin', which is important, but what or who is meant by it? The film is entertaining for those who find a 1940s detective film interesting."]},

While the technique screams \"Araki\", as does the casting of Kathleen Robertson, the narrative is so conventional that you find the combination hard to reconcile. I loved an earlier comment that \"Splendor\" is like a John Hughes remake of \"The Doom Generation\"; i.e. very conventional and without the sex and violence, with a three-way relationship (two males-one female), Johnathon Schaech, and Director Araki's absolutely amazing production and post-production skills-along with his less than dazzling scripting.", "Although Araki is paying homage to the great screwball comedies of the 1930's: \"Topper\", \"It Happened One Night\", \"The Awful Truth\", and \"Bringing Up Baby\"; the style and substance of \"Splendor\" is closer to Mike Nichols' \"The Graduate\" (not to mention an amusing parody of the \"Graduate's\" climatic wedding scene).", "Kathleen Robertson has the Rose McGowen part in this version of \"The Doom Generation\" and is generally well suited to the role. I have not decided yet if Robertson is in McGowen's class as an actress, or in the class of her fellow Canadians Mia Kirshner and Sarah Polley. Robertson was excellent in \"Maniac Mansion\" and \"Beverly Hills 90210\", but these were similar roles that appear to mirror her own cool and detached personality. One thing that is clear is that she was a great choice for Ariki's trademark close-ups. Anyone perceptive enough to close the camera to face distance when shooting McGowen, Robertson, and most recently Michelle Trachtenberg has a eye for breathtakingly beautiful visuals.", "The premise does not really have enough substance to sustain a feature although it might work as a half-hour television sit-com (see \"Three's Company\"). When the premise becomes tired the story brings in a new character, Eric Mabious; and the film self-destructs, killing time until a decent ending sequence. A tip-off that a screen writer has limited life experience to draw from is having cast and crew occupations for the characters. Robertson's character is an aspiring actress and Mabious is directing her in a made-for-television drama. His character is so hopelessly one-dimensional and painfully pathetic that I was convinced that he had a sinister side (what was with those blue contact lenses) that would eventually manifest itself. But this does not happen, maybe Araki had something interesting in mind and abandoned it in re-write. Mabious becomes a non-factor (see totally irrelevancy) and his scenes were simply inserted as padding to get this thing up to feature length.", "The bottom line is that Araki fans will be a little disappointed with \"Splendor\". It is very conventional, it isn't much of a story, and the good banter is limited (although Kelly MacDonald has fantastic dialogue in all her scenes) . But if your Araki appreciation is more for his directorial talents (casting, mise en scene details, camera movement and placement) and his post-production originality, you will find \"Splendor\" measures up very well to his prior work. The morning after scene early in the film simply blows away anything similar from any director."]},

VHS version of this anime series was available in the late 70's and early 80's and I watched it again back then. The drawings are effective but rather basic, with lots of blank spaces. By the standard of later Japanese animations like \"Akira,\" \"Ghost in the Shell,\" and \"Cowboy Bebop,\" it is rather sparse and basic to say the least. ", "I compared this animation with cartoonist Jiro Kuwata's original manga graphic novel \"Eito-Man,\" on which the TV series was based. The graphic novel is much better drawn than the TV animation. The drawings in the graphic novel are much more sensual--like many of Kuwata's drawings. It is not very clear from the TV series, but Kuwata's graphic novel shows obvious influences from American comics like \"Superman\" and \"Batman.\" Some anime connoisseurs say that \"Eito-man\" is Japan's answer to Superman and Batman.", "Kuwata and late story writer Kazumasa Hirai added a touch of Buddhist philosophy to \"Eito-Man.\" The word \"Eighth Man\" is really referring to Buddhist god Hachi-man. (\"Hachi\" in Japanese means \"eight.\") In Buddhism, Buddha reincarnates in the form of different gods to save humans. Hachi-man is one of those gods. Kuwata, who later became a born-again Buddhist, wanted his robot Eighth Man to be a manifestation of the Buddhist god Hachi-man so Buddha can save the innocent people from evil men and women. What is unique about Eighth Man's Buddhist influenced theme is that Eighth Man showed mercy to everyone--even to some villains. In one episode, Eighth Man, with a great risk to his own safety, saved the life of a gangster, who earlier tried to destroy him. The gangster greatly appreciated Eighth Man's deed and promised to reform his ways and be a good person. Story writer Hirai, with his Buddhist philosophy, must have believed that most humans--even some gangsters--can be salvaged. This is greatly different from other superheroes who just kill and destroy villains without showing any mercy to them. Even as a child in the 60's, I was greatly impressed with Eighth Man's sense of mercy and forgiveness.", "Unfortunately, Jiro Kuwata could not complete his graphic novel series \"Eito-man.\" In the mid 1960's, just before completing the last installation, he was imprisoned for illegal possession of firearm--which is a grave offense in Japan. (The story writer Hirai and his publisher hired another cartoonist to finish the Eito-man series. However, Hirai was not satisfied with the finished product.) In the 1970's, Kuwata suffered from depression and alcohol dependency. Later, he became a born-again Buddhist. Finally, in the early 1990's Kuwata, who by this time became sober and regained his confidence, finished the very last installation of the Eito-man series. ", "It is interesting that there is such a dynamic human drama even behind a children's cartoon series. I am glad that Kuwata, a child prodigy who completed his first graphic novel at the age of 13, overcame his alcohol problem and is currently utilizing his awesome talent. Kudos to Jiro Kuwata!! Also, may the soul of Hirai, who died in January of 2015, rest in peace."]},

Her mature adult Zena voice is often heard in roles like \"Mom Racer\" and any other adult woman/teenage/or small child roles (girl or boy) of the three aforementioned shows,sans The Mighty Hercules.(I have met her in person on two occasions.)

Veteran Peter Fernandez was the writer of the Johnny Cypher series as well as the voice of one of Cypher's reoccurring villains,\"Nero Tyrannor\".In addition to Nero,Johnny has other reoccurring adversaries as well such as \"Gorlok\",\"Doctor Root\",\"Mister Mist\",\"Napoleon\",just to name a few.

Made by Saban Entertainment, the same company behind Power Rangers (and therefore, the company partly responsible for TMNT's downfall, other factors being the horrible third movie and the fact that the Turtle train ran out of steam, resulting in a drop in quality for the toys and cartoon), it's an okay attempt at a live-action Ninja Turtle series, but sadly, it is a flawed one.", "The series is a loose continuation of the New Line films (therefore, we have the subway lair seen in the second and third film, and Splinter is still missing an ear).

The heroes-in-a-half-shell are now 18-years-old in this show and are in for new adventures along with a new female Turtle, Mei Pieh Chi, a.k.a. Venus De Milo, a Shinobi apprentice (which in this show, Shinobi is another word for chi magician). Shredder is there, but only for the first two episodes, as he is defeated and replaced by a new villain named Dragon Lord, an evil dragon who leads The Rank, a group of dragons who were imprisoned by the ancestors of Venus' sensei, Chung I. Other villains used are all exclusive to this series, and that includes Silver, a yeti who is a crime boss, Dr. Quease, who is basically the show's Baxter Stockman, only he is into studying mutation, and Simon Bonesteel, a big game hunter who hunts and sells endangered species.", "So, with this series, it is live-action with suit actors (like in the New Line films). However, the editing is poor, as you can see the suit actors missing stuff and a scene where Mikey accidentally touching Venus' chest in one episode due to the suits not giving much vision. Also, Saban make a lot of continuity mistakes in the series (like the controversial dialogue where Leonardo tells Venus the four Turtles we know and love are not really brothers). Plus Venus herself has been a controversial character. She is basically a fish out of water who uses \"Shinobi magic\" and her main thing is getting sayings wrong (like calling the Turtles' home a toilet and Raph correcting her that it's sewer).", "Those flaws were enough to turn many TMNT fans away. The reason for its cancellation is conflicting, with official sources saying the ratings were not good, with another source saying Saban pulled the plug due to the show being expensive to produce and as Fox Kids did not own the TMNT franchise, they did not make any money from merchandise sales. From there on, the story continued online, however, when Kevin Eastman sold his share of the franchise to Peter Laird, Venus and all the other characters introduced would be erased and locked away, never to be used again (even as a joke, as Kevin Munroe would say in an interview for the 2007 TMNT film). While this is okay, the flaws do detract this show from being great, but I believe characters like Venus and Simon Bonesteel should be used in future series, especially if they were given improvements to fix the flaws this series showed."]},

This dub has become infamous among fans due to its mangled translation work, unprofessional-sounding voice works delivered by only a handful voice actors, mispronouncing names or outright renaming characters, and for oftentimes drastically toning down the original dialogue or inserting new bits of inappropriate language like swearing or unintentional innuendos. The dub was mostly available through bootleg tapes, but it has been released on various DVD sets in the West officially, beginning from the early 2000s.", "Featured in ", " (2015)", "The first Transformers series produced entirely in Japan, \"Headmasters\", is worth watching and purchasing if, like me, you're interested enough in seeing more G1-style Transformers episodes to overlook some serious flaws. It is not for people who liked the 2007 movie and want to try some earlier incarnations; for that look to the original 1984-87 series. I might even say it's not really for people who lost interest during the 3rd series of G1, as it carries down an even more esoteric path. This is not to say some of these people definitely wouldn't enjoy it, but in my own personal estimation it has some flaws only a serious Transformer fan could love. Of course, every other version of TF has had serious flaws, but many have reaped far greater rewards for getting past them.", "The series is infamous for its poorly produced, ill-researched and risible English dub. It is often very funny, but I couldn't help but think how great the series could have been with a dub from the G1 cast. Unfortunately there are problems with the series no matter what language one watches it in. The show has a continuing plot throughout the 35 episodes, which is initially promising but it gets muddled quickly with some truly far-out concepts. Several familiar characters (chiefly Galvatron's henchmen Cyclonus and Scourge) seem to have had their IQs diminished in the move to Japan, which is a shame because most of the new characters aren't that interesting. The score is often grating; not a patch on the original series and especially not Vince DiCola's inspired work.", "But I digress; there are some nice things about Headmasters. The censorship restrictions in Japan are nowhere near as severe as they are in America leading to some interesting scenes; chiefly some deaths which while they are not a patch on the famous scene in the 1986 movie, are quite effective in their own way. The animation is not great, but it adapts more overtly Japanese motifs to the style of the classic series quite nicely. Of course the main appeal for many fans will be to see many TF characters in the classic style for the last time. Though their behaviour and movements may be different, all the characters from the G1 series who appear here are based on the same animation models they always were. \"Headmasters\" does allow us to get a closer look at many characters who were underused in the original series, such as the Gestalt teams and most notably Fortress Maximus and Scorponok, characters based upon the two biggest toys in the original line. If that last sentence interested you, \"Headmasters\" is worth watching, if not necessarily going too far out of your way to do so. If it didn't, don't bother! BTW, the theme song contains lyrics which roughly translate to \"This current suffering we are going through will be of benefit to future generations\". Catchy!"]},

The assured, creative B/W photography and grimy art direction is uniformly excellent, and the eerie jazzoid score by clearly talented composer, Gyorgy Vukan is a chilling, Lalo Schifrin-style delight! I sincerely found 'Defekt' (1977) to be a hugely entertaining downbeat thriller, and I hope that a great many other similarly broad-minded, treasure-seeking Euro-cult cinephiles will also get a chance to appreciate this offbeat macabre masterpiece of Hungarian, jazz-fuelled terror!"]},

From the three films I've seen with him, Psilander seemed an okay actor given film acting at the time, but, here, he falls folly to the common way of pretending to be religious and moral in a picture that's supposedly the same--that is, by being stiff and rigid in pseudo-reverence. Apparently, many filmmakers thought muscle tension and lacking vivacity were next to godliness.", "Furthermore, the pacing is rather slow and meandering (but at least it's only an hour long). The exception to all of this is the beginning of the flashback sequence. The lurid episodes of sex and crime leading to the protagonist's imprisonment and reformation are congruous with the thread of sensational film in Danish silent cinema. The rest of it (except for the climax), with its lackluster reverence, is quite opposed to what one expects from the era.", "There are also some interesting film techniques here. A dolly-in and dissolve simultaneously for the transitions around the flashback to the sensational. There's low-key lighting, including a silhouette of a woman undressing. The filmmakers actually stopped filming to add lighting before resuming scenes when the preacher turned on a lamp, seemingly lighting the set by itself. The window that features prominently in these scenes at the preacher's room adds to the overall effectiveness of the mise-en-scène.", "(By the way, the timing and execution of that gunshot scene sure was wretched.)"]},

The real problem that's stated here, in my mind, is how a court order is really nothing, because she still loves her husband in a sick way to where she doesn't turn him in the instant he shows up on her doorstep.", "The only problem is that I got the feeling the actors were just going through the motions. Amy Pietz is seen here as the crisis center volunteer who shows no emotion when she gets the call from O'Grady. And O'Grady didn't hold her character because you could see the fear on her face when her husband was walking up the sidewalk and later that night when they're all in the house, but that fear found a courage (from somewhere) out of nowhere.

That was just primitive of the animation standards being followed. Their gait, mannerisms and action were also pretty primitive and repetitive.

Plots were excessively simple and had no twists or any real attempts at storytelling. They all revolved around some sort of moral motive which was summed up by an annoying talking bat at the end of each episode. Ghostly Aesop's fables perhaps? There were also plenty of clichés and there was really no real action or dialog (from the heros) worth mentioning or remembering. But that can be forgiven if one considers that the intended audience were just young children.", "Some fans of the admittedly superior \"Real Ghostbusters\" cartoon series unfortunately have a filthy reputation for slandering things that are not their cup of tea, especially Filmation's GB series.

The best of all Ghostbuster cartoons was however, Extreme Ghostbusters (XGB) which actually was mature and made for adults for a change.

He claims to be under the gun to pay a debt, and pimps her out as an \"escort\" to help raise money, with Gigi soon finding out that she's merely whoring for him.", "She doesn't get wise (or angry) until she finds him one day in her bed with another woman.", "In present-time, Ruth answers a want ad for a photographer's model, and the film's most tedious sequence unfolds. The Village photographer looked (and acted) to me to be character actor Philip Baker Hall, uncredited in this softcore assignment which obviously wouldn't look nice on his résumé. His improvised, slightly French-accent hambone performance is terrible, as he pretends to be just doing his pro shutterbug job, when in fact he is manipulating the girl into split-beaver poses (not shown). He ends up stiffing her out of the $25 he promised for the photo session.", "After this horrible vignette blows over, Sylvia (Linda Boyce) relates her tale of woe. Her husband (a creep with terminal acne) later in their marriage insisted that she whip him, to get him aroused for (conventional) sex. Eventually he turned the tables and started to whip her -a no-no, cueing their divorce.", "Gigi is working as a topless waitress at a bar, where a pesky customer keeps insisting she go out with him. Appealing to Sylvia for help against this stalker type, Sylvia suggests that Gigi bring him home and the gals will enact revenge.", "They tie him up and then absurdly play strip poker to decide which woman will service him first. Threat is that if he can't perform and satisfy all three of them in a row, he's in for a whipping (Sylvia having nostalgically kept hubby's whip all this time). Twist ending is predictable, stupid and unsatisfying.", "Much of the film is cheaply shot MOS, with one or the other of the actresses narrating. Direct-sound is used for dialog scenes, but the improvising is poor. A guitar solo, running at least an hour in total, dominates the visuals, and is occasionally effective in setting or amplifying a scene's mood, but this baby couldn't be saved in post-production."]},

Between synthesizer-driven vignettes of people running, falling from high buildings, getting shot to pieces or giving CPR to a squashed cat, we get some dialogue in short parodic sketches, the best of which are the television news flashes serving as info dumps and taking the mickey out of a few contemporaneous celebrities. The mandatory (for the 1990s) Silence of the Lambs parody manages a few hits as well, but director Neil Hardwick's cameo as a jiving gangster is just as unfunny as the Tarantino soliloquies it parodies.", "Visually, the film is impressive in creating scene after scene of bloodbath and stunts with breathless pacing.

Nice for them, but the jokes may be lost on the viewer."]},

The movie is about a man who is accused of murder with no real evidence except for his name, which happens to be Jurek Kiler. He gets himself into a much deeper situation throughout the movie. There are several real funny lines in the movie, but I doubt they are quite as funny when translated into English. Jerzy Stuhr, arguably Poland's greatest actor, plays the lead detective and anything he says is funny. In Polish comedies the humor is not so much in what is said, but how it is said. The humor for the most part comes from the ironic tones and facial expressions of the actors. For those who are not familiar with Polish film history the first, and for a long time only, film making academy was in Poland. Many of the camera crews, set directors, and props directors from Hollywood were actually educated at this Polish institute. I hope you enjoy the film. Cheers."]},

This is because Park Ki Yong tried his hand at depicting something different. However there is a serious problem with this film as it runs out of steam too soon. This is because there is very little coherence between what is being filmed and what the director intended to portray. As far as the erotic elements are concerned, to my mind they are too fake, arty and simply pretentious.

Produced and directed with great care by Bill Milling (a/k/a both director \"Philip Drexler\" and his producer alter ego \"Bill Eagle\") who made this between his surprisingly witty SATIN SUITE and his frivolous fantasy DELICIOUS, it does a good job of recreating the early 20th century and more specifically Hollywood depictions thereof, occasional anachronisms (such as electric lights !) notwithstanding. ", "The part of convent-bred rich girl Heather was a breakthrough role for talented thespian Veronica Hart, just hitting her stride following her supporting turns in Leon Gucci's Seka quartet (PRINCESS, TARA, CONFESSIONS OF SEKA & SEDUCTION OF CINDY), and she brings out every single nuance as her character evolves from dewy innocence to knowing worldliness. As stated in her father's will, she's to marry handsome young Frederick (Paul Thomas in an excellent, brooding portrayal worthy of Vincent Price in his Roger Corman/Edgar Allen Poe heyday), the gardener's son who  it is disclosed by the spoilsport family attorney on their wedding night moments prior to consummation  actually turns out to be her brother ! Unable to make love to his beautiful wife and sister, Frederick arranges for his bride to be erotically awakened without taking part in the act himself. The trusted chauffeur, well acted by Robert Bolla (who was to be Hart's partner on many a subsequent outing), will do just nicely instead. One stormy night, he gently seduces Heather in the barn as they shelter from the rain for one of the most thoroughly sensuous seductions of all time. Meanwhile, Frederick releases some pent-up tensions of his own with fiery cook Vanessa Del Rio and fledgling kitchen help Tracy (not late '80s actress Tracey) Adams, the dream girl from Larry Revene's FASCINATION, highlighted by some explosive back-door loving' courtesy of the Latina mega star. ", "Little-seen Nicole Scent lends her throaty voice and succulent slender frame to the part of maid Margaret, caught in flagrante with the Master and making up for it with the Mistress. She'd go on to play Jerry Butler's girlfriend in DELICIOUS and join the cupcake cast of Milling's lavish BLONDE GODDESS before disappearing from sight. Another now largely forgotten Golden Age actress worthy of mention is busty amazon Lisa Be, who would deliver a career performance in Cecil Howard's complex carnal confection SCOUNDRELS and provided solid support in movies ranging from Roberta Findlay's ill-fated LIQUID ASSETS to Fred Lincoln's exquisite THAT'S OUTRAGEOUS, portraying Heather's scandalous aunt losing her honor in flashback to sweet-talking soldier Ron Hudd and therefore called upon to instruct her young charge in the ways of the world. Ultimately, Heather and Frederick can no longer deny their passion for one another and agree to one night of incestuous lovemaking to be concluded by their suicide pact. But there's a kicker to all this high melodrama, provided by another fleshy flashback, this time involving Heather's mom as brought to lusty life by bug-eyed cutie Christie Ford, a performer forever attired in typical French maid's outfit in my mind due to her appearances as such in both Shaun Costello's AFTERNOON DELIGHTS and Ron Sullivan's A GIRL'S BEST FRIEND. With all the preceding heavy breathing and bodice-ripping, it's safe to say the remarkably cynical conclusion is not what you'd expect. ", "Great ambitions heighten expectations so, as a result, shortcomings tend to be magnified. While Milling demonstrates a good eye for detail, truth of the matter is that this is still a low budget effort by mainstream standards so rough spots in acting and production do rather stick out a bit. Of course, none of this should bother longtime adult fans who get to feast their eyes on a cult cast doing what they do best."]},

Seems that Monet, a much overlooked performer by the way, was always causing trouble for mom, faking a pregnancy by her rich married lover Steve Drake just so she could get him to part with a stack of cash or making the hired help (maid Crystal Gold and butler Tony Martino) perform sexually for her masturbatory benefit. By contrast, her other daughter Kirsty Waay was as loving and supporting a spawn as any self-sacrificing noir mater could hope for. What has really happened here ? ", "The story works fine, not taxing the performers too much even though several of them, the women especially, seem quite capable. Not much star power on display here, so it was a chance for some underestimated talent to strut their stuff. Waay, at the beginning of an interesting career that somehow never really fulfilled its initial promise, and Monet shine as the contrasting offspring and each provides the kind of sex that makes good on this movie's title. Monet's hot with the ever dependable Drake. Waay has a totally sensuous Sapphic slurp with ravishing Rayveness and does a high voltage number with Alec Metro, but it's super-busty Gold who'll score with solo strokers in her scalding kitchen scene with a chomping at the bit Martino. That's above average for story and sex. Wish I could say the same for production. The video has a cold and flat look similar to early '80s shot on Betacam offerings but quite unacceptable for a feature of this vintage. Still, to quote Meat Loaf, 2 out of 3 ain't bad !"]},

This turns on the more adventurous of the two teachers, Margaret, but literally shocks prudish Constance.", "Mr. Wally pushes Constance up on stage for the followup audience participation segment, and Reynolds introduces her to the fine art of cunnilingus.

Even so, Kandi still looks like exactly what the part called for -an amateur from the audience, and not someone in the Rolodex of Pretty Models Agency.", "Attempted kinkiness falls short, as Kandi tries twice to demonstrate \"toe-humping\", first with Constance and later the emcee, but it consists of merely softcore rubbing of foot against her private parts. She also repeatedly refers to the emcee as \"sir\", an odd but effective kind of domination/submission motif.", "The gals wake up next day with a hangover and are planning their next $19.95 trip for summer vacation, with the calendar handily turned to June 1973 with \"End of School\" date circled to give an idea when this baby was shot.", "A real cheapie, film's effectiveness emanates from the use of 1-shot, believably amateur talent. I prefer the superstar opuses of the early '70s, when the biggest names worked for a pittance, but unlike \"Elvira Simpson\" and \"Sylvia Conners\" the presence of Suzanne Fields or Rene Bond in the lead roles would have destroyed all credibility, given their over-familiarity."]},

This kind of scene would now be referred to as a b/b/g (short for boy/boy/girl) but was then more commonly known as a \"queen triad\", just to show that times don't always change for the better.

Dia does a creditable job keeping the heat at a fairly constant level with plenty of attention towards female enjoyment of the sex acts on display. From a production point of view, it's a relatively polished affair with bright, colorful cinematography, some snazzy editing and a deliciously eclectic soundtrack that grooves along infectiously with each lewd gyration.

{"title": ["The Seduction of Lyn Carter"], "plot": ["A housewife finds herself strangely attracted to an abusive sex researcher."], "ratings": "7.3", "director": [], "writers": [], "stars": ["Andrea True", "Jamie Gillis", "Sharon Thorpe", "Tony Rousso", "Robert Cole"], "img": [], "descriptors": ["1974", "X"], "url": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0127824/?ref_=chttp_i_3", "synopsis": [" (1975)", "Arguably the best of the \"Wes Brown\" movies, a pseudonym employed by the late great Sam Weston - a/k/a \"Anthony Spinelli\" - during the first half of the '70s, SEDUCTION OF LYN CARTER provides a chamber piece setting with a small group of characters and a limited number of locations he would return to when shooting on video over a decade later. While the reasons therefore were on one hand undeniably economic, its pared down structure simultaneously offered him the opportunity to explore people's nature and motives regarding their sexual needs with an entomologist's eye for psychological detail. His findings weren't always pretty as this movie and its equally scorching companion piece PORTRAIT OF SEDUCTION illustrate.", "Married for 15 years and mother of an unseen teenage son, elegant Lyn Carter (Andrea True) is the treasured trophy wife of apparently successful business man husband Darrin, persuasively played by Robert Cole (billed as \"Peter Gibbs\") who was also in PORTRAIT and Brandon G. Carter's mesmerizing DEVIL'S ECSTASY. Financially secure, there's no need for her to work. Along with the fact that she wed the first (and only) man she has ever known sexually, this has created a social vacuum all too easily pried apart by devious Don Juan Sean (Jamie Gillis) during Darrin's absence while he's on a business trip. Not coincidentally, Sean just happens to be a psychology student ! They meet and chat at the eye doctor's office - she has an in-grown eye lash - and he casually invites her for lunch the next day. After a few drinks too many, he lures her back to his place, all but forces her to smoke pot and takes advantage of her. Shocked and confused, Lyn learns she enjoys the treatment, sending her on a downward spiral as she keeps coming back for more humiliation. Initially threatening to tell her family, Sean soon discovers he doesn't need to resort to coercion in order to keep her in line...", "Once the affair between Lyn and Sean takes off, the action becomes practically non stop and it's down to the thespian talent of Gillis and True that the intensity never lets up. No surprise as far as he's concerned, but Andrea True has rarely received praise for anything other than her 1976 cross-over disco hit More, More, More. Still living comfortably off its royalties, she was one of the major female adult performers of the early '70s but seldom recognized as such in retrospect. Presumably, this blatant oversight's due to her lack of industry longevity, unlike Georgina Spelvin for instance, or the absence of skeletons in her closet, like Linda Lovelace. Always the great actor's director, Weston drew a searing performance out of her that should be enshrined in the annals of adult cinema history, never putting a foot wrong as she goes from picture perfect middle class respectability to unbridled out of control sexual addiction. Put like this, it sounds like macho wish fulfillment (you know, any prissy demure woman just being a slut secretly waiting to happen) but, trust me, that's not at all the way Weston allows things to play out on screen. Actions ring uncomfortably true, including the husband's unexpected response when faced with his spouse's self-confessed infidelity.", "In keeping with the film's modest scope, informed as much by subject matter as budgetary restraint, the form is stark and to the point with intimate camera work by Kenneth Jackson who also did a fine job on Weston's unsettling NIGHT CALLER. Basically a two character drama with the cuckolded husband added as some sort of bookend figure, its cast is augmented with one shot Italian stallion Tony Russo and the amazing Sharon Thorpe  who would garner considerable praise as well as several industry awards for her indelible work on Weston's subsequent SEX WORLD  as strange couple Doll and Angelo whose \"services\" Sean has acquired for Lyn's on-going debasement. Film's downer ending may not be what most would expect but it's honest and refreshingly free of moralizing."]},

", "The premise is that old adult movie stand-by : the object that awakens its owner's dormant sex drive, in this case a gold pendant crafted by pagan druids ! Following a brief solo stint by then current Penthouse Pet of the Month Mariwen Roberts, the trinket's first owner is spoiled party girl Dee Dee (the vastly underrated Lesllie Bovee who would partner as well as match huge John Holmes in that same year's ERUPTION) who doesn't quite remember how the jewel came into her possession except that it somehow wound up in her purse after a booze-soaked night on the town. Giving her lowly gardeners a hard time, the blue collar crowd exacts their own brand of revenge on the \"rich bitch\" in a rape scene of the \"they may protest at first\" variety. Bovee's bucking resistance is fairly credible as is her subsequent more than willing cooperation, so I suppose it's up to individual viewers whether they can stomach this sort of thing. For the record, the guys are Mike Ranger (Kay Parker's son in the original TABOO), under the radar stud John Galt (from the cult favorite TEENAGE CRUISERS) and early industry legend Ric Lutze (who partnered cute Rene Bond in Richard Aldrich's wickedly funny beach movie send-ups HIGH SCHOOL FANTASIES and BEACH BLANKET BANGO) as the lout who taunts Lesllie with the indelible line : \"See what I mean, Jellybean ?\" ", "Lonely French teacher Abigail (Georgina Spelvin bagged another award for portraying suppressed spinster passion as only she could) winds up with the gem next, which gets her into a slightly coercive if rather erotic threesome with Monique Cardin (a minor mid-'70s starlet whose main claim to fame came with the starring role in Charles Kaufman's idiosyncratic SECRET DREAMS OF MONA Q) and a youthful Jon Martin. Dear Abby bequeaths the necklace to her favorite nephew, philandering senator Turk Lyon (Randy West's cross-dressing partner in crime in Svetlana's tremendously enjoyable SEX BOAT) who's trying to squeeze in some afternoon delight with saucy secretary Laura, played with piquant insouciance by genre goddess Serena, for what amounts to the film's funniest segment with Lyon forced to hide in the bubble bath to avoid detection by his unexpectedly returning spouse.", "The movie's most satisfying sex is up next however with gym coach John Leslie finding himself at the mercy of a redheaded double whammy courtesy of Dorothy Lemay and Lori Blue, gap-toothed Marium from Joanna Williams' LITTLE GIRLS BLUE movies. After having put the bench-press to good use, the three of them retreat to the steam room for a bizarre but undeniably arousing swim cap and goggles number, imaginatively photographed by one \"Max Wellman\", a surefire pseudo as this credit doesn't seem to appear on anything else. Sadly, it's all downhill from there with Richard Pacheco (Lenny to John Leslie's Jack in Sam Weston's TALK DIRTY TO ME and NOTHING TO HIDE), who found the gem at the gym, trying to talk Cris Cassidy (the blonde amazon who started out as \"Suzette Holland\" for the same Sam Weston in SEX WORLD and EXPECTATIONS) into going all the way in the backseat. He's the only one in the flick to strike out but the magic jewel grants him professional success instead.

Handling of the glass high-heeled shoe (rather than slipper, Cindy being a prostitute after all) gimmick is very poorly done in a slipshod rush to provide a happy ending after the clock strikes midnight and the orgy ends.

At the close of the Sixties Davis had directed several minor softcore movies, however in the early Seventies Davis developed a kink for mixing sordid sexploitation with Herschell Gordon Lewis brand of gore slaughter which manifested itself in two supremely shocking features.  The other is the outlandish Evil Come, Evil Go (1972) a gruesome tale of Sister Sarah Jane Butler, who butchers `love generation men' in LA to the theme song of `Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane you're insane'.  Whereas Evil Come, Evil Go cleaned up, the earlier Sex Psycho fared less well- it was simply deemed unreleasable, never showing up anywhere either on video or the cinemas.  Even the efforts of the producer (Cuban born sex film pioneer Manuel S Conde) and a change of title to the more X friendly Widow Blue, all proved in vain.  The Sex Psycho of the title and our hero of the piece, if he could be called that is Nick (Mike Haven- the cat burglar from Al Adamson's Brain of Blood) a pudgy faced average Joe who taunts and ridicules his sloppy wife (Sandy Demsey) over her coke-bottle glasses and natty blonde wig.  A marriage made in hell, he's a sexist pig who complains about her burnt cooking, while she threatens to run back to her mothers whenever he says boo.  Despite his low opinion of his wife's sex appeal, Nick is convinced that someone out there finds her attractive, especially when he overhears her talking to her lover on the phone.  Enraged, Nick promptly goes out and buys a large meat cleaver, then takes to fondling it in his car with a look in his eyes that suggests he has more on his mind than cutting cake with it. Oddly his other half isn't the intended victim, instead Nick speeds over to his mistress Eva Blue, only to find Eva's bi-sexual husband Jerry Blue (played by none other than the director himself) getting under the sheets with Eva's brother Marshall.  Egged on by Eva and helped by Marshall, Nick sinks the cleaver deep into Jerry's neck.  Things become even more vomitious when the whacked out Eva Blue drags Nick onto the bed for some post-homicide heavy petting despite Jerry's dead body providing interruption `Don't worry about him, he's dead, dead, dead'. Dim Marshall is suitably horrified but agrees to hide the body in a big, black coffin, yet again though libidos provide a distraction.  When the three Sex Psychos finally remember they have a corpse to dispose of a pair of Jerry's swinger pals Ron and Sarah show up and (only slightly fazed by the big black coffin in the middle of the room) quickly turn the place into a suburban swingers party!! Well remember this is the Seventies and only then could a scriptwriter get away with the line that comes from the ubiquitous John Holmes `we're all 21 and responsible citizens, so let's just take off our clothes and get it on right here'.  Despite Holmes alarming presence, Davis reserves the freakiest moment for the completely basketcase climax that leaves Eva screaming her guts out, Nick bleeding to death holding on to a bloody stump and his wife choking to death.  Not without credence is the legend that a single showing in the dawn of the Seventies had potential buyers running from the theatre as if the Blob had invaded.  What distinguishes Sex Psycho from typical XXX movie house fare, sealed its commercial fate.  If the extreme gore didn't get to them, the scenes with Davis and friend would have had dirty mack dwellers deeply suspicious that they had gone to the wrong theatre.  Davis evidently saw allot wrong with the world, Evil Come, Evil Go takes several pot-shots at religious fanaticism while Sex Psycho sees the world behind every picket fence as a cocktail of violence, insanity and false morality.  Even so for their grim storylines and messages Davis's features remain cartoonishly over the top and always on the very dark side of black humour.  His Sex Psycho script is so mockingly vulgar as to bring laughs to the most morbid melodrama, also hilariously jarring is his taste in music with demented organ music and liberal uses of the theme from The French Connection and Night on Bald Mountain.  A personification of the skinny, ear muff sideburned, long haired LA freak that every conservative feared, little is known about writer/ director/ erst-while Mr Jerry Blue and all round enfant terrible Walt Davis- other than the movies.  Soon after getting Sex Psycho and Evil Come, Evil Go out of his system Davis wrote his way into obscurity, his last known credit was a script for Deep Jaws a film made in 76 by Manuel Conde.  Today Sex Psycho is best viewed as the black sheep never invitied even to the table of the most extreme films from America's most extreme era and most extreme medium.  Too much for audiences of the day, its still not for everyone but if you're looking for something unique, especially outrageous and with the explicit sex and death that comes with Seventies excess then Walt Davis is your man."]},

So let's just consider these as his top five personal best then. Like those other titles, SEX WORLD stands as an adult classic that truly seems to have everything going for it.", "The screenplay, consisting of intertwining story lines involving a large group of exceptionally well-played characters, is realistic and rich with incisive observation . Production values are on a par with anything pouring out of mainstream studios at the time. Editing in particular – with artistically composed and juxtaposed imagery – could very well be the best ever witnessed in the adult field. But holding it all together is Weston's subtle guidance, picking out tiny details that throw a whole new light on a dramatic situation and teasing once in a lifetime performances out of a superstar cast.", "As the original ads proclaimed at the time of the film's original release, SEX WORLD picks up where pop science fiction flicks WESTWORLD and FUTUREWORLD left off with a theme park aimed squarely at adults. The promise of being able to set up every possible sexual scenario attracts a disparate bunch of characters whose stories are followed from the flashback drudgery of daily life to the exhilaration (and, tellingly, in one case disenchantment) that comes with finding their deepest longings satisfied.", "Lust legend Lesllie Bovee, an exquisite light comedienne in movies like Chris Warfield's CHAMPAGNE FOR BREAKFAST, and fly by night performer Kent Hall who had bit parts in Stu Segall's YOUNG STUDENTS and THE SPIRIT OF SEVENTY-SEX have an endearing chemistry as the happy couple seeking to spice up their marriage, only to be confronted with doubt and insecurity. As a painter of female nudes, Lesllie harbors suppressed lesbian tendencies so a passionate encounter with gorgeous next door neighbor Abigail Clayton (star of Antonio Shepherd's 7 INTO SNOWY) is in order. For the less complex husband there's a threesome with giggly Chinese chick Carol Tong and cult favorite Amber Hunt who'd delivered a standout performance in Weston's CRY FOR CINDY, her adult film debut. Comic relief comes from the director's male muse, John Leslie (who has of course starred in most of Weston's masterpieces), as a loudmouthed racist who gets a tumble with the only black female superstar of the '70s, Desirée West (a/k/a Pat Lee) who's resolved to prove that \"his spigot ain't no bigot !\" Momma's boy Jack Wright, an outstanding character actor (mostly for Weston but also in Alan B. Colberg's NAKED AFTERNOON) forever rumored to have resorted to a studly stand-in for his hardcore footage (though he certainly did perform with Jesie St. James in EASY), and belligerent spouse Kay Parker – making her porn debut following a non-sex performance as Madame Jacinda in Gary Graver's V - THE HOT ONE – provide a much darker shade of humor with their incessant mind games. Watching his wife being taken by force (by longtime actor Joey Silvera, still active today) from behind a two-way mirror, Wright finds solace in the arms of little-seen Maureen Spring whose only starring role was in Jesse Pearson's LEGEND OF LADY BLUE.", "It's back to Heartbreak City with Annette Haven, the uncrowned Empress of Erotica and perhaps the most beautiful adult actress of all time (surely the only possible choice for the role of the alluring Sheherazade in Edwin Brown's A THOUSAND AND ONE EROTIC NIGHTS), as a Sapphic recluse who has just broken up with her girlfriend of five years (blonde amazon Cris Cassidy, billed as \"Suzette Holland\", making a fleeting debut before knocking viewers flat on their backsides as one of Bob Chinn's CANDY STRIPERS) in search of male companionship.", "Saving the best for last, AFAA Best Actress Sharon Thorpe (too frequently overlooked but she should be high on any real dirty movie devotee's list of people to enjoy in movies like Gary Graver's 3 A.M.) burns up the screen as a mousy secretary trying to break free from her lonely existence through a scorching romp with big black stud Johnnie Keyes wearing his iconic white peekaboo BEHIND THE GREEN DOOR outfit, though her sad phone sex conversation with Peter Johns earlier on is just as riveting.", "With such a vast number of characters running and playing around, SEX WORLD risked becoming just a long series of sex scenes with little time left for plot development. Fine filmmaker that he was, Weston effortlessly managed to sidestep this probability by encouraging his talented cast to make love in character. Too many people still seem to think that just because the sex is for real, and instinctively we all know how great that can feel and how it can make you forget all that is going on around you, surely there can be no room for any acting left, as if an actor's capacities were somehow magically zapped away at the moment of penetration. My spelling it out should prove once and for all just how ludicrous that notion really is. Sadly, even critically acclaimed yet occasionally explicit art-house movies like Marco Bellocchio's DEVIL IN THE FLESH or Patrice Chéreau's INTIMACY have done little to alter that perception for the average viewer.", "Nearly three decades ago, SEX WORLD achieved an audience's full interest, nay, involvement in the plight of its set of characters whose story's effectively furthered through the sex. Not wanting to come across as an apologist (i.e. someone who feels the need to find a legitimate reason, other than his penchant for looking at pretty naked people, for viewing and enjoying pornography), I would have to say that SEX WORLD accomplishes its goal of being a complete cinematic experience – looks like a real film, sounds like a real film, so it must be a real film – far better than most XXX movies made since."]},

I think Walter Long played the role in all five versions (American, Spanish, French, German and Italian). In any case, we have now the proof that it was Walter Long in the Spanish and German versions, as the first one exists on video (\"De bote en bote\") et a segment of the German one has been found, and shown on TV and DVD, and Walter Long plays the same role in this. If Karloff was really in the movie (whatever the version) he would have played a little role. Why ? because he wasn't fluent in French, as proved by the fact he was replaced by other actors for French-language versions of two of his films made at the same period : \"The Criminal Code\" (he was replaced by Daniel Mendaille in the French version, \"Criminel\") and \"The Unholy Night\" (another actor played his role in the French version, \"Le spectre vert\", directed in Hollywood by Jacques Feyder). So, if Karloff was replaced by French actors for the French versions of two of his movie, it seems highly dubious he replaced an American actor, Walter Long, for the French version of another movie !!! Of course, the only way to solve the problem would be to find this French version, but unfortunately it is \"lost\" since decades. Since the immediate post-WW2 period, the film known in France (where I live) as \"Sous les verrous\" is in fact a dubbed print of the American film, NOT the original French-speaking one. To date, the only French-speaking movie of Laurel & Hardy still in existence is \"Les carottiers\", released on DVD by Universal, which is \"Be Big\" and \"Laughing Gravy\" combined together (same thing for the Spanish versions, \"Las calaveras\", also available on DVD). The Italian version of \"Sous les verrous\" is apparently lost too."]},

I consider myself a fan of sleazy hardcore films, and this film couldn't have been too much sleazier if it tried. The 'plot' focuses on Rebecca, a young girl who is the victim of a father who sexually abuses her. We know he does this because we get to witness it! In a scene that doesn't hold back and goes on for rather a long time. After that, Rebecca runs away to a school where the headmaster abuses the female pupils, all of which are nymphomaniacs anyway. The atmosphere is very grubby, and it's always clear that this film cost little more than a few pennies to make. The acting is completely ridiculous, but the film gets points as the bondage and torture scenes look very real. I have to criticise the choice of actresses though; why do the makers of rough porn flicks always hire ugly women? The soundtrack is memorable...although that's because it's been lifted wholesale from John Carpenter's Halloween! Overall, The Taming of Rebecca is likely to be a hit for fans of this sort of stuff. I can't say I really loved it, but at least it did what it says on the tin."]},

Brian Green did a terrific job playing the role of a father considering at the beginning of the movie he was a college 'kid' who was willing to give up his paternal rights.  I was quite upset with both sets of parents at first; understanding that it is a mother's worst nightmare to have her child relive the events from her life.  I thought it was unfortunate that Jason's stepmother was so selfish about her marriage and her beauty sleep that she forced him out using the excuse that her marriage (to Jason's dad) was in jeopardy.

This is the show that established Peter Gantzlers career as Taxa Mike a tough action-hero/taxi driver who is not afraid to get his hands dirty but is also a loyal friend and an overall charming guy. There are a lot of other great actors in this, but it would take me too long to mention all of them. I do have to mention the main villain \"Herman fra City Bilerne\" the CEO of the competing taxa company. Herman is a cold businessman who is deadset on taking control over Krone Taxa due to some mysterious past he has with the company. Whenever you see Herman he will present himself as a gallant businessman, usually offering help to some character. Eventually Herman will show his true face as a ruthless capitalist and his gifts will turn to poison. He reminds me in many ways of some sort of devil from fiction.", "A great cast of characters is also accompanied by great writing. There are a lot of storylines throughout the show and you should be prepared for love triangles, recovering alcoholics, car chases, drugdebts, murdercases and incompetent policemen, just to mention a few. I will say that in some ways, there will be so many things going on in an episode that even if you don't like a particular storyline, you shouldn't worry too much cause there will be b and c plots in one episode to take your attention. Some storylines feel like they don't have a satisfying conclusion, some feel like they are completely forgotten a few episodes later. I suspect that the show might have been produced under a tight schedule, which may have caused some things to feel a little rushed.", "With that said, I definitely recommend people to give it a try - if you are from Denmark, which I assume you are if you are looking this show up - you can find it for free on DR's service 'Bonanza'. The show is not in the ideal format and you might have to use an obscure browser app if you want to see it on smart-tv and there won't be subtitles, but it's 56 episodes of great entertainment for free."]},

In keeping with the themes explored here, he exchanges the glossiness of those aforementioned films for more modest if solid production values with lighting and camera work particular standouts. After more than two decades, the frequently venomous satire has lost none of its bite though it generally tends to steer clear of the mud-slinging approach of Joyce Snyder's RAW TALENT series. ", "Former adult filmmaker (and Sullivan's alter ego) Harry Crocker, exceptionally well portrayed by veteran performer Eric Edwards (who was in those pre-DEEP THROAT loops with Linda Lovelace), has built a respectable life away from the industry with his snooty spouse Miriam (Sharon \"Mitch\" Mitchell, very funny and surprisingly credible as a prude after nearly a decade's activity within the genre), his lofty documentaries gaining respect yet losing money, forcing him to go back for \"one last time\". Yeah, right ! ", "Producer Lorraine Loveborn (nasty Lee Carroll has never been better) has her personal reasons for luring Harry back to the fold and her own style of auditioning new talent, as evidenced by her jaw-dropper of a scene with aspiring starlet Sharon Kane (who made her debut in Alex deRenzy's 1978 PRETTY PEACHES and is actually still around today), possibly the most high voltage Sapphic sizzler this reviewer has ever witnessed. As shooting gets under way, this allows Sullivan to add all sorts of cute little observational gags. Personal favorite may be Joanna Storm's bungled audition (with Allan \"Spike\" Adrian) that opens the film. Struggling to find an appropriate ending, Harry has to create a fresh spin on the typical porno situation of the master seducing his maid, the enactment of which (with Mai Lin looking scrumptious in domestic garb) leads to an unforeseen conclusion.", "Sullivan clearly knows his turf and the material here is simultaneously bitter and upbeat (so shall we call it realistic instead ?) about the industry. Dialogue is clever and delivered to perfection by a highly talented cast. Funniest line (perhaps ever in porn) must be Sharon Kane's reply to Carroll's request as to whether she would consider back door intercourse : \"If the script justifies it.\" ", "Sex varies from light and breezy such as the on-set stuff with master Michael Bruce and maid Ashley Welles to hot and heavy, a good example of the latter being the incredibly intense sequence with Edwards talking a totally turned-on Tiffany Clark (who made such a splash in Richard Milner's highly enjoyable CENTERFOLD FEVER) through a professional performance with stalwart George Payne. More affectionate and milder (yet still with an axe to grind), GREAT SEXPECTATIONS proved an equal as well as a sequel to this fine film, recounting the further adventures of Harry Crocker, this time as deeply immersed in porn as he has ever been. The glamorized beyond recognition (courtesy of producer David Friedman whose soft core classic STARLET ! was re-adapted for the occasion) Matinée IDOL unofficially completed Sullivan's industry insider triumvirate."]},

On the contrary, if this has any value as masturbation material then, frankly, the filmmaker didn't do a good job since the aim is to keep it on subject and on the experiences of women and their bodies and images of themselves and society and health and so on. Indeed, I would be a little circumspect of one who came across this on DVD or, if it ever plays again, late night on HBO or Cinemax and used it as a means for pleasure. You might as well go to the supermarket and pick up a pair of ripe melons and take them home and squeeze them and uh, well, you get the idea.", "No, this is semi-serious film-making meant for premium late-night viewing, but it shouldn't have to be just for the late-night types. This is intimate in setting but not in tone. All of the women, in all their variety of shapes and sizes, and races, and even with one man thrown in with fake breasts, have something of value to say, from life experience in the most straightforward way. If I say semi-serious it's due to the several little segments that the director feels she needs to throw in, with the archival footage of old \"how-to\" videos about puberty and sex and breasts and super-rare cartoons with the knockers flying about. This isn't a problem but an asset: we need a few little visual seg-ways to go between these interviews.", "Nothing is held back, and we see it as feminism in a liberating form: they don't need to cover up, and even if they choose not to take their tops and shirts and bras off they're still open as can be about a natural part of their body that is an object of sex, surprise, comfort, discomfort, curiosity, motherhood, and, sadly, cancer. In that last part, there's another brave step taken as we see a woman who survived her cancer with only one breast. You know you've become mature and an adult when you can see this woman who has somehow gone on to live a semi-normal life with one breast (the most bittersweet moment is when she says if a fairy godmother said she could have one wish to have two full breasts she would have to think about it), and you don't snicker or go \"eww, gross.\" That's the test, folks.", "It's not shot under the best of circumstances, but then again for TV it's edited with a tight pace. It's never dull for a moment, and we never feel like anyone is holding back, especially when a man might hear the hard truth like that breasts may not really be erogenous, or that a flat chest is very attractive to some men. Breasts: A Documentary is about deconstructing myths with real faces and breasts and minds and hearts laid bare. If that's worthy of a \"I was alone\" session, then, well, more power to you, I guess, though it's not the intention."]},

These men were loved by all even the Nazi soldiers, but ironically three of the six men happened to be Jewish. And just like the rest of the Jewish of people during Hitler's rule, they were not able to continue to lead their normal lives, celebrities or not. You see spectacular scenes in this film were the group performs and you get good examples of the harsh treatment of the Jews by the Nazi. There is a love triangle with in the group that brings out a steady stream of character development. This with the racial segregation makes all of the character come to term with their futures. There was a wonderful performance by the entire cast; I could not imagine any other actors or actress for the roles. The lighting and sound of the movie was good, with great shots to go with them.

His most famous story which received wide acclaim is called 'The Warriors.' Now director Daniel Hugh Jones initiates this fascinating Yurick novel entitled \" The Confession. \" It's an important story taken from the pages of todays headlines. Harry Fertig (Ben Kingsley) is a well respected, devoted and loving father who's six year old son is suffering from acute appendicitis. Upon rushing him to the Emergency ward of the hospital, he is told his son who needs immediate attention will have to sit, wait and fill out forms. The result; his son dies. Concluding someone has to be held responsible, the grieving father sets out to punish the hospital receiving attendant, (Eric Malabar), the admitting nurse (Becky Ann Baker) and Dr. Mason Gillett. (Mark Ethan) all for putting their own troubles ahead of an emergency patient. After his son's death, Fertig murders all three and then surprisingly enough, surrenders to the police. While awaiting trial for murder, Fertig is given a public defender whom he promptly fires. However, his new defense lawyer Roy Bleakie (Alec Baldwin) is a well connected, ambitious attorney who is instructed by his client to plead him Guilty! With many rich and powerful people concerned his client might be given the death penalty, Bleakie is ready to plead him Not Guilty by reason of insanity. However, Fertig insists, he knew what he did was wrong and is willing to accept punishment, even if it means being executed. The story is intriguing from it's onset and the collected cast does a marvelous job of imbuing understanding, sympathy and deep emotional drama to the characters. All one needs to do is live in our speedy, fast food, hectic style of life to realize what this case is all about. Anyone who has ever been run-over by the uncaring freeway of ambiguity we've created or have experienced the churning frustration we daily endure, know what this movie is all about. The result; this film has become a Classic and is easily recommended to anyone who cares. ****"]},

So, viewing a dark Russian tale in such a colourful, lively environment added to the already heightened feeling of high quality weirdness that 'Stakha' (English title: 'The Savage Hunt of King Stakh') conveys. The wonderful and adventurous strangeness of later Soviet era films, so little seen in the West, is here evident, but with an added ingredient of genuine gothicness, somewhat akin to Herzog's 'Nosferatu', but with a thrust further into undiscovered corners and shadows. Rather than discomfort though, this film brings with it a certain coziness, more Poe-like than horrific, much more Byronic than Stephen King-ish. There is a sort of perversity in the art direction, which perfectly accompanies the singular mood of this obscure picture. It was 20 years ago that I saw it, and it is the mood of the piece, not so much the imagery or the soundtrack, which remains in the memory. Naturally, I wish it were accessible. At least one sale of a DVD version would be assured."]},

In fact, the intense and rather downbeat narrative unfolds against a backdrop of class manipulation and ruthless banditry in 19th century Sicily: the young sister of protagonist Fernando Lamas rejects the advances of a middle-aged baron (who boasts of having had every girl in the village!) and leaves her home on a stagecoach, which is then waylaid by outlaws – the passengers are all killed but not before she has been gang-raped! ", "Lamas, knowing the reason why she had tried to start a new life elsewhere, sets out on his revenge by first eliminating the lecherous nobleman (after literally playing a game of hide and seek with him during a religious procession!). His plan to get even with the desperadoes, however, is more elaborate – as he determines to infiltrate the outfit and learn the names of every man responsible for his sister's violent death; to this end, he finds an unexpected ally in British lady journalist Lisa Gastoni (less showy than either of the other roles for Lenzi that I have just watched her in, namely QUEEN OF THE SEAS {1961} and MESSALINA VS. THE SON OF HERCULES {1964}) intent on interviewing – and, by extension, bestowing celebrity upon – the group. Anyway, the hero's baptism of fire sees him single-handedly liberate one of their number from the gallows; besides, he falls for the redheaded sister (played by Liana Orfei) of another member.", "Before long, the true nature of both Lamas and Gastoni are discovered: the latter is shot dead in cold blood, but he is hounded all over the plains by his would-be cohorts (the title presumably refers to his showdown with the mob leader) and, unsurprisingly, the girl sides with her lover in the matter (even if he is forced to kill her own sibling). The last act, then, acquires Shakespearean overtones (specifically \"Hamlet\") – as the dusty ground becomes riddled with corpses, including the romantic couple expiring in each others' arms. This particular fate of the protagonists, the film's very title and the presence of bandits in the narrative also points towards the shadow of David O. Selznick's super-production DUEL IN THE SUN (1946) looming large over it. With this in mind, the film has a modest tragic power to it that, effectively complemented throughout by agreeable visuals, makes for an undeniably interesting (if minor) outing in the \"Euro-Cult\" stakes."]},

The guys have to figure out what they are going to do, so they decide to go camping and wind up getting chased by some hillbillys who try and shoot them!  Meanwhile Benny, (the only roommate with a job) slips at work and lands in the hospital.  To make things even more tough, Jim, (the antagonist roommate)is caught stealing some food in Ray's room and breaks his leg diving out the window to get away from the confrontation of being caught by Ray and Steve. Now Jim's in the hospital too, but not for long, when the doctor is not around he makes a mad dash out the fire escape and hitch hikes home, back to the Flophouse. Great performances by all of the roommates and rest of the cast, but the chemistry between actors Thomas Wilson Brown and Bernie Coulson as best long time friends Ray and Steve is impeccable. It's so real. The makeshift fun things like a homemade pool table with coffee cans to catch the balls, (a broom stick for a pool cue, that is actually chalked up before shooting) and the homemade jacuzzi made from a refridgerator all add to the uniqueness of this hilarious film. Also, the music is great, bands like Electric Frankenstein, Frisbie, Kevin Lee, Nutrajet, All Systems Go, make for a very tasty and fresh soundtrack.

I am a fan of Paolo Villaggio, and normally I like his movies, the Fantozzi series for example, but also many of the less known movies from the 1970's, but this one is a stinker. It's a spoof of the classic 1950's and 1960's horror movies, with Villaggio as the improbable hero, Fracchia, a man afraid of virtually everything. The feeling is actually that of the classic horror stories, and if it wasn't for the attempts at comedy it would indeed make an almost decent b-movie... but unfortunately it tries to be a comedy, failing all the way. The plot is as thin as it can be (Plot? What plot?), and there isn't a single memorable scene, nothing at least a bit funny. Actually, I felt almost sad after watching this movie. Why would Villaggio accept to make a film like this in 1985, when he had already had quite a lot of success with his Fantozzi movies? I guess he needed the money badly, I can't see no other reason for him to do this.", "This is a difficult one to find (my copy is a videotape I bought back in the 80's), especially outside of Italy.

Rather than simply giving audiences a overly-flattering theatrical trailer, it instead offers a behind-the-scenes look at the musical-making process. Songwriters Mack Gordon and Harry Revel, usually relegated to unseen duties, are the two main stars of the film, working together (in true Hollywood musical fashion) to spontaneously invent hit song numbers that audiences will fall in love with. Gordon is quite a personality; he acts, sings and dances both confidently and enthusiastically, and I was surprised to learn that his time spent in front of the camera was very limited. He might have made an entertaining performer, and has got an excellent voice. Revel is more conservative with his acting, remaining vigilantly at the piano and playing music as he does best.", "Setting the film from the songwriter's perspective is an interesting move, contrasting their relatively unglamorous lifestyle with the extravagant musical numbers later seen on the movie screen. The short largely follows the creation of two songs. Firstly, the title number \"College Rhythm,\" which has already been written but needs to be rehearsed in front of the camera. Roberti and Oakie are seen practising the song, with the director looking on behind the camera. Then Roberti goes to join Gordon and Revel, and the three of them ponder another song that is to appear in the film. \"Take a Number from One to Ten\" gradually takes shape, and we briefly follow its progress from simple words inside a musician's head to a fully-fledged extravagant set-piece complete with Lyda Roberti, a complete band and a chorus of waving cheerleaders. 'Hollywood Rhythm' is a brief, immaterial piece of advertising, but it's also a suitably pleasant and interesting inside-look into the studio music-making factory."]},

But as more medical staff are found dead around the hospital by unusual circumstances, there may more at play this day than initially thought. Through all this chaos, Bock may find some meaning in life in dealing with the case of patient Edward Drummond, who came into the hospital a relatively healthy man, but who has fallen into a coma the result of that staff mismanagement/incompetence. That meaning comes in the form of Drummond's daughter, Barbara Drummond, an RN herself, who wants to take her father back to Mexico where he had been doing missionary work.", "Dr. Herbert Bock (George C.

Barbara Drummond (Dame Diana Rigg) has come to take her comatose father back to the Sioux reservation, where he operates a clinic, and they each reach out to each other for emotional support, as a shadowy figure stalks the patients and staff of the hospital."]},

Keep in mind though it's not as exploitative as you might expect. Unlike modern-day, American zombie parodies that are every bit as bloody as the \"serious\" movies they're parodying, this has no more grue than your average Abbott and Costello or Three Stooges movie, so definitely don't go into this expecting a gory Italian flick like Lucio Fulci's \"Zombi\". The director of this, Nello Rossati, was responsible for the Ursula Andress sex comedy \"The Sensuous Nurse\", which thanks to a lot of late-night cable showings in the 80's is probably THE most well-known 70's Italian sex comedy for America audiences. I was definitely expecting more sex therefore. But even Montagnini, who typically played an unlikely stud in Italian sex comedies, doesn't manage to get laid here, and there is very little in the way of T and A. What there is, however, is provided by Nadia Cassini (who pretty much had the Platonic ideal of the perfect female \"A\").", "Cassini was probably the third most ubiquitous actress in 70's Italian sex comedies after Edwige Fenech and Gloria Guida. She was actually a trained dancer and she does a zombie striptease here that pre-dates the one done by porn star Jenna Jameson in \"Zombie Strippers\" by nearly 30 years. Of course, she does it without the benefit of special-effects make-up(and she doesn't go all the way regrettably), but it's much more hilarious because she manages to perform it in an awkward, shambling zombie gait. Much like Cassini's striptease, this isn't as high-tech or as an exploitative as the countless zombie (and zombie sex) parodies they make today, but it was really a film way ahead of it's time in 1979."]},

Some of the great scenes involved, oddly enough, two underaged porn starlets. Well we know Traci Lords was underage. It's also been said by many that Ali Moore was under 18 for a portion of her abbreviated porn career. But Ali, who in her own right was a real sexy girl, never created the total and complete captivating attention and delirium that Traci created when she burst onto the porn scene in 1984.", "Moore's scene with the native tribesman, while her father watches was both very hot and very disturbing. But this is porn so put aside the instinct to turn away thinking the old man in the room was actually Ali's dad.", "The scene with Amber Lynn and Peter North was also very hot. She gets bitten and finds herself alone in the elevator with North. She and North go at it like two kids in heat. And do they ever heat up that elevator. Amber possessed one of the finest bodies in porn and at that point she was simply beautiful to look at. And North reciprocates her advances taking Amber from behind, grabbing and pulling her hair, squeezing her large breasts while she shows enormous enjoyment.", "There are other scenes but the viewer I'd bet waits in anticipation to see if Traci will get bitten. She plays a nurse who along with the doctor/researcher Harry Reems, are on a mission to find and capture this magic mosquito. So does Traci get bitten? Well, you have to see the movie to find out. But it is no sunrise for you to reveal that Traci and Harry have an extraordinary sex scene. Reems actually was a pretty fair actor. Traci herself would go on to a post porn career as a straight actress of some repute. When these two porn legends finally get naked their scene is so well shot and lit. We have Humphrey Knipe and his wife Suze Randall to thank for that. The viewer actually can count Harry's six pack even through his stomach hair. And Traci's magnificent 36D breasts, so full and demanding the viewer's attention, were never lit and filmed so the viewer can understand what a turn on she was. She writhes and contorts while being sex'd up by Harry. This movie had to be one of Traci's all timers. Even though she only had the one scene believe me that scene is well worth waiting on."]},

Soon a retarded girl (Man Chung Han) witnesses Dee getting rid off the body parts and so he should kill her, too, but can he really kill that innocent and really harmless girl just like that even if sadistic May tells him to?", "\nThe film has also little roles by Michael Wong and Kent Cheng (why is he involved with this junk?) and they play naturally police inspectors trying to solve the mysterious murder cases as body parts appear in various places. The actors are pretty talented and do their roles with care but that's perhaps the only good thing in this film.", "The film has absolutely no point other than exploitation in the sex and violence departments. It tries to be very visual and stylish but fails pretty miserably because the weird and twisted camera angles don't mean anything in the film, they are just there but there's no reason for their existence. Ivan Lai's PEEPING TOM (1997) is another example of this: the camera angles are all the time very twisted and \"unusual\" but it becomes very pointless and unnecessary as it doesn't depict the characters' emotions or anything else in the film's world, because there's NOTHING to be depicted because all the films want to be is exploitation, violence and sex. The director thinks the film is now very wonderful and even \"artistic\" but it requires much more than just wild angles for film to become a seriously noteworthy piece of cinema. The first scenes showing Dee in the street walking in the crowd in slow motion are genuinely pretty effective and work because at that point, nobody knows about his character too much and it creates a very ominous atmosphere to the scene and the effect is not used throughout the whole film.", "The film includes also the retarded girl being captured by the killers and treated pretty much like a dog so the film is far from being \"correct\" on any level! Also the explanations and motives for the killers' acts are very ridiculous as the film tries to hide its exploitation status and tell something important about being bullied as a child and the traumas of that kind of experience. The violence and nudity is mediocre but still strong enough to secure the CAT III rating and nothing less and that's exactly why the film was made in the first place. I cannot appreciate this film more than 2/10 and I'm happy most other CAT III rated films are much more noteworthy and have many cinematic merits, too."]},

Stuck at home, she decides to entertain herself by seducing the handsome doctor/college professor (Pino Colizzi) who lives next door. After he (quite unbelievably) spurns her amorous advances, she decides to sneak into his house and catches him en flagrante with her voluptuous stepmother (Nieves Navarro). She takes pictures of them together and uses them to blackmail, humiliate, and generally take revenge on the adulterous couple.", "This movie has elements of each of the three earlier sexy melodramas Amadio did with Guida--the weird dream sequences from \"La Minorienne\", the strip-tease in front of an open window from \"Quella Eta Malizia\", and, of course, the photography and blackmail plot from \"So Young, So Lovely, So Vicious\". But this is a much more of a comedy, where Guida's character is more mischievous than malicious and isn't (necessarily) going to get anyone killed. It's not a bad film per se, but it's more on the level of Guida's later \"liceale\" (\"college girl\" or \"schoolgirl\") movies, and it's just not as entertaining as something like \"So Young, So Lovely, So Vicious\" (and it's definitely not as good as \"Amuck\" or \"Smile Before Death\"). It is a good role for Guida since she gets to play a very mischievous character, which gives her a lot more personality than in some of her later comedies where she was sometimes reduced to just kind of a bland piece of nubile ass. (Moreover, at no point does she do any disco singing, a second career Guida unfortunately would take up later). Pino Coizzi as the doctor is pretty weak, but Jacques Dulfino as Guida's military officer father (whose arm is stuck in a cast,unfortunately, in the \"heil Hitler!\" position) is pretty funny. And if Guida is a little too young for some tastes, Nieves Navarro(as always) makes for a very good MILF (or since she's a stepmother here, I guess she'd technically be a SMILF).This the the weakest of the Sivio Amadio/Gloria Guida films, but it's not bad."]},

It's hard not to cry and not to feel empathy with the indigenous workers in \"The Land Burns\" or \"It Happened in Hualfin\". Gleyzer loved the working men, women, and children of this earth and it is reflected in his documentaries. He considered himself a humanitarian and a revolutionary and felt that this vocation could best be served in field of cinema. Sadly it was his vocation, his ability to show the brutal exploitation of the Ruling Elite and the gentle nobleness of the indigenous people that led to the Argentinean military government assassinating him.", "\"México, The Frozen Revolution\" is a brilliant documentary worthy of being on a top 10 list of great documentaries. Gleyzer shows how despite all of its rhetoric the 1910 Revolution was anything but revolutionary. At the onset of the revolution 97% of the land was owned by the 1%, by the end of the revolution 50% of the land went to the peasants. In reality as the documentary shows. The workers never got a change to enjoy the land at all. Given poor land and forced to borrow at high rates or sell their crops at low prices, the workers continued to be marginalized which is true to this day. Images of the 1970's presidential campaign praising Mexican democracy are interwoven with images of exploited, noble hard-working peasants as well as the brutal 1968 Tlatelolco Massacre in Mexico City; claiming over 400 lives, mostly naive students who thought they could change the government by peaceful protests. After all Mexico is a democracy, right? Ultimately Gleyzer shows how democracy and elections are a sham to pacify the people: Because at the end of the day, the Ruling Elite(oligarchy), not the people (democracy) control all the strings and will use force before conceding even one dime to the workers who actually toil."]},

American adventurer Alan Foster (Richard Harrison) has the misfortune of running up a huge gambling debt with a 'friendly' Indian Rajah (Daniele Vargas) who demands that it be repaid in full on the very next morning; the latter will only relent if Foster – who boasts of having been the one to rob the Bank of New York – acquires for him \"The Mountain Of Light\" (the film's original Italian title), the aforementioned jewel in a temple heavily guarded by religious fanatics.", "Apart from the genuine fun to be had as the tale itself unfolds, the most remarkable thing about this film – especially for one coming from this stable and from this timeframe – is the fact that, while all stock characters and situations associated with the genre(s) are present and accounted for, they often take an unexpected form: every self-respecting hero has to have a damsel-in-distress (love interest) to rescue, a dastardly opponent (villain) to defeat and a charismatic sidekick (comic relief) to abet him. However, the woman only comes into the picture in its last third(!); likewise, the obligatory dance number that is always one of the ingredients in exotic adventure fare comes very early on here and serves a definite plot point rather than just adding local colour. Indeed, it is the unheralded whipping of the girl (Luciana Gilli) after she accidentally bumps into the Rajah that reveals the latter's true colours for the first time, just as Foster's defence of the girl here will lead to her helping him eventually; by the end of the film, however, even the Rajah has seemingly converted and concedes that the rightful place for \"The Mountain Of Light\" to be is inside the statue's forehead. ", "Similarly, the hero's volatile association with an impoverished, smelly fakir (Wilbert Bramley) runs the whole gamut from amicable banter to professional partnership (his participation in the ingenious TOPKAPI- style robbery sequence inside the rat-infested temple is essential to the success of the enterprise) to homicidal pursuit; it is from his clutches that he is running when he bursts into the dancer's quarters! As it turns out, the fakir had been the Rajah's henchman all along and is not averse to whipping the girl himself as she is strapped to a stone in a cavern. Apart from the aforementioned cheekily irreverent epilogue (with Harrison suddenly addressing the audience straight-to-camera), another comic highlight is watching our hero, painted black and donning a turban, parading as a mute outside the temple because he has stuffed the stolen jewel into his mouth for temporary safekeeping! In conclusion, I think that this handsomely-mounted production, lensed by cinematographer Angelo Lotti and set to a pleasantly atmospheric score by Francesco De Masi, should be much better known than it is and, as far as I know, has bafflingly never even been shown on terrestrial Italian TV! I guess I also ought to mention here in passing that an earlier India-set Umberto Lenzi/Richard Harrison collaboration, THREE SERGEANTS OF BENGAL (1964), remains an elusive entity...since the sole available full-length copy (only a half-hour's worth, dubbed in English, is accessible via \"You Tube\"!) was ripped off Italian Cable TV but, then, bafflingly had the original Italian audio replaced with the English track!! Similarly, one other Lenzi-helmed epic set against this colourful backdrop i.e. TEMPLE OF THE WHITE ELEPHANT (1964) is only accessible via either a French or German-dubbed version...the original title of which, incidentally, would literally translate to SANDOK, THE MACISTE OF THE JUNGLE!!"]},

I sure do. But more than that, I like it when the plot bends in favor of that borderline self-insert, at the expense of making every single character in the movie seem completely unrealistic. Because when everyone around you is an immoral pathetic pervert or a doormat who only exists to satisfy basic desires, your words will sure have more weight, even if the gist of these words is \"listen, there is no heaven and that means no hell because I said so, that means no one's life but mine matters, if I want something I'll just do it, it's my desire and nothing else matters, since there is no one to judge me in the end, that's why I will bring Sodom wherever I go and this script will in fact let me do just that and that's why I'm right\". And that's a good takeaway from this film.", "As you probably have guessed, I completely disagree with the nihilistic masturbation presented in this movie, and especially this type of storytelling where the only thing that can respond to a preacher is his echo, not because he's right but because the opposing side of this pseudo-debate just spills spaghetti and in literal terror backs away from him. Other than that, you should, in fact, watch this film and make your own judgment. The movie has very good shot composition, and it's very interesting to watch.

Emanuela (Sherry Buchanan) is married to an abusive, insensitive man, and seeks solace with her fantasy dream lover, Marco ... a high school heart throb who perished in an accident. In contrast, her estranged sister Giovanna (Paola Montenero) runs a fetish brothel, reveling in the darker side of life. Emanuela's mother urges her to reconcile with her sister, but the initial encounter terrifies and repels the girl. By strange coincidence, she then encounters a young street merchant who is the spitting image of her Marco. Emanuela pursues the boy, only to find herself betrayed and raped. This trauma results in the disappearance of Marco - her only source of comfort - from her dreams. Without Marco, she can no longer endure her husband's brutality, and turns to her sister for a way out. Ironically, it was Giovanna who had orchestrated the cruel affair in an act of \"tough love.\" Emanuela lures her husband, Roberto, to Giovanna's brothel so that he can witness her involvement in a staged orgy, and grant her a divorce. Giovanna is happy to oblige, taking matters a step further after Roberto has seen his wife's apparent infidelity ... beating and raping the misogynist. Having thus freed Emanuela from her bondage, the two sisters are physically and spiritually reunited as they were in their mother's womb - Giovanna's evil and Emanuela's goodness melding into one whole human being."]},

But overall it has enough merit to it to warrant at least a single viewing.", "The story is set in the 17th century, during a period of strife on the eastern fringes of Polish territory, in today's Ukraine. The main plot centers around a rebellion of Cossacks against the oppression of Polish landowners, in the greater setting of a conflict between Poland, Muscovy and the Tartars.The book was written from a Polish standpoint, so there is some obvious favoritism shown, but the main characters are not one dimensional. The motivations of the characters are clearly explained, and the good guy is not always good, and the bad guy is not always bad. The political intricacies may be a bit confusing, but at its heart this movie is a love triangle, so as long as you focus on that, you can follow along.", "The main reason to watch this movie is visual. If you are one of those people who likes to have a movie transport them to another time and place, this movie is for you. The costumes, props and scenery are simply beautiful. All the characters speak in the language they are supposed to speak, so you have conversations in Polish, Ukranian and even Tartar. The performances by the main characters are wonderful, ranging from comedy to romance to drama to action.", "The movie has a bit of something for everyone. If you like action, the battle sequences are fantastic, very massive in scale. If you like romance, the lead characters are not too hard on the eyes, and their passionate feelings come across the screen quite strongly. There is a very strong comedy element as well, but you might have to understand Polish to appreciate it fully.", "The special effects in this movie leave a bit to be desired. It certainly is a bloody, and at times gory film, but really no worse than a lot of recent US offerings.", "If I was to use a US movie as a thematic comparison, Last of the Mohicans might be a good choice, with the hero looking for his love in a wild and savage environment.", "Overall I would recommend this movie to fans of historical films. The plot is fairly straightforward, so you can focus on watching the visuals instead."]},

He's surrounded by peppy co-stars: Janet Banzet as an aspiring actress he keeps misleading and taking advantage of, a loyal secretary (credited under pseudonym Elizabeth Easter), a rich socialite girlfriend Willi (soft porn veteran Uta Errickson) and a pornographer/photography associate played anonymously by \"Stanley McAvoy\".", "With endless yapping credited to screenwriter Walter Berger (all of whose credits are suspiciously for Larry Crane-directed movies within a one-year period), film revolves around Damon's machinations to blackmail folks so that he can make a quick buck, his p.r. company notably failing. He even has to borrow 50 cents (those were tough times) from his secretary at one point.", "An untalented country singer badly played by anonymous \"Biff Williams\" is sought by our hero to represent, but he has to deal with his irascible manager Joe Kugel. Damon has conveniently inherited a 145-acre Long Island estate, so he plots with McAvoy to wire up the place for hidden photography and blackmail the hick singer and his manager.", "Cheap movie has no budget for sets, so the L.I. mansion is totally unbelievable, its scenes look they were shot in the Brill Bldg. too, or more accurately, on the same sets purporting to be his office there. A restaurant/night club scene is ineptly staged, merely as an excuse to see the wonderful soft porn superstar Linda Boyce strip.", "In fact, the only reason this film was made and its sole content is the female cast members disrobing frequently to show bare breasts and bums to the camera. Chief participant in this charade is the tragic Banzet, a starlet who committed suicide in 1971 and who looks embarrassed throughout this farrago. Her character makes no sense and the happy ending of her going away with the country boy to get married is absurd. The ending is so sudden and sloppy that it would stand out if it weren't for the sloppiness that precedes it.", "That said, it would be interesting to sit through the other remaining titles from this production outfit (Lark Films) to see what else they perpetrated from a camp point-of-view. The other 3 of their titles in IMDb all appear lost at the moment: the aforementioned SUGAR DADDY, a tale of the Marquis de Sade titled THE DEVIL IN VELVET and the cleverly named THE MASTER BEATER. Given the current weak state of the porn reissue industry (streaming has killed DVDs of this sort just as surely as the DVDs put their VHS brethren out of business) I doubt if anyone else cares enough to get them back in circulation."]},

The characters in this film were likable, even if underdeveloped. Most of their relationship conflicts were less than interesting and worked mostly to set up the plot. This is typical of slasher films, so I won't hold it against this film in particular. Once the slaughtering began, this movie became a non stop Gore fest that actually took some unexpected turns. The ending was a bit confusing, as I'm not entirely sure what happened to the surviving character. Still, it did seem to tie the film together, while adding a much appreciated element of mystery.

They drive the bus to the house of the judge who originally sent them to prison, where--since this is after all a women-in-prison picture--the hostages undergo various forms of physical and sexual abuse in various degrees of nudity.", "A blue bus loads a number of college girls from a coffee shop in the snowy meandering mountain road - tennis players (ARTEMIA TERENZIANI, ANGELA DORIA), the black champion Terry (INES PELLEGRINI), and Claudine, a girl who has first aid training (MARINA D'AUNIA).", "About the same time, four women convicts are escaping from Portobello Penitentiary: Monika Apler (LILLI CARATTI), a 25 yer-old terrorist; Ursula (ZORA KEROVA aka ZORA KEER); a hefty 25 year-old serving time for robbery with violence; Diana Brandley (DIRCE FUNARI), a hustler serving time for blackmail and murder; and Erika (ADA POMETTI), a lesbian drug addict and smuggler. They run through a green valley, but are intercepted by the criminal police. In the shoot-out, Monica and Pierre, the terrorist who helped the girls out, kill the two policemen. Pierre is wounded. They take the white police car and drive up the mountain. They overtake the blue bus, and then force it off the road. Then, they go on board, and hijack the bus.", "Pierre is attended to his wound by Claudine. Willy, the bus driver (FRANCO FERRER) tries to jump Monika and take hold of her gun, but she beats him back, and menaces to shoot him, keeping him quiet.", "Monika directs the bus to near a mountain villa, twelve rooms. She knows it belongs to a judge (FILIPPO DE GARA), who is the father of Terry's girlfriend. Monika takes Terry with her, and comes to the house. Terry seems to recognize the judge, but not vice-verse. The middle-aged, spectacle'd magistrate serves the two girls sandwiches, then he hears a radio announcement giving the identity of the four escaped convicts.", "The convict girls hold the college girls hostage in the mansion. In a flash-back, one knows the judge has raped a young woman. Hefty takes Pierre away away from the lounge, as they await the coming of a Female Warden who tries to talk them to surrender. Ursula recalls how that bad woman searched for her day and night, and now she can take revenge... Erika calls the warden 'bull-dyke', and shoots her, out of lesbian love for Ursula. Of course, the police has the house surrounded, and used the parliamentary as a distraction to enter the house. Only, Diana sees a Policeman coming down from the roof, and they exchange gun shots; the girl is wounded in her lower right leg, but another cop dies.", "Monika distributes free whisk from the judge's cupboard, and discusses politics with the Nurse. The Nurse throws away her drink, to try to keep sober for the expected hard time ahead, but Monika sees the girl's gesture. Erika confiscates the bottle from Monika, who is already under the influence. Asked by Nurse what she intends to do, Monika answers: \"Right now I can think only of two things. One is to smash your face. The other is too personal.\"", "Everybody is expecting a final assault by the police. Diana decides to take Claudine - the Nurse, in white leggings and hot pants - up to a bedroom, and make love to her, while there's still time. Ursula talks with Erika, and recalls how she was afraid of not having enough food to eat, then decides to go to the kitchen for a snack. Diana keeps drinking, and makes love to Claudine on the bed. Downstairs, Willy and the college girls are dancing around Terry - as if they were actually hosts, and not hostages of Monika and the other criminal girls. The judge is alone, having yet a nightmare with Monika's crotch - was she the girl he raped?", "Claudine must have escaped Diana after her exertions, and hides behind the couch where Monika sits. Then, Monika goes to the kitchen, has some words with Ursula, and they engage in a shoot-out, and Ursula falls dead.", "Meanwhile, Claudine attacks Erika, and the two women fight over a kitchen knife. One of them dies, with the big knife cutting through her belly.", "Diana jumps out of bed, nude as she was when she laid with Monika, and walks away through the corridor. Monika calls after her from the bedroom door, and when she looks back at her, she shoots her dead point blank.", "The criminal police police surrounds the house. Monika is sobbing by Diana's body, when Terry comes to her, and offers her to go with her in the escape car the police finally left in front of the door. The two girls drive off - only to be machine-gunned to death by the police ambushed beyond the next road bend."]},

The disparity of Rick's tiny-looking member at rest and its porn-level measurement when tumescent is actually the film's dominant contrast.

Wayne is home from the sea, and ready for some girly action. While he and his mother exchange a lot of sexual innuendo, nothing develops along those lines. His father is a Bible-thumping minister who is sexually dominated by his wife behind closed doors. Mom generously points son Wayne towards young Sally Porter, who has grown to womanhood during Wayne's long absence at sea. Fortunately, Sally is as big a horn-dog as Wayne, and they get it on almost immediately. The next morning, Wayne drives mom to work, but finds that \"work\" is just a ruse, as she hops in a cab after Wayne drops her off. Wayne tails her to an apartment building, where he spies on her through the skylight. Turns out good old mom is a Satanic priestess, conducting a ritual of initiation for a young woman on this particular morning. The Satanists eventually spot Wayne spying on them, with potentially dire consequences for the boy. He must endure a life-threatening ordeal - involving \"sexual communion\" with the new initiate. While it never appears he's in any danger, he survives the \"ordeal,\" joins mom as a fellow cultist, and acquires supernatural power over women ... which you'll get to see in the sequel, Happy Days [1974, International Home Video Corporation, in which we also meet Wayne's sister, \"Debbie\"]."]},

Having the women moan, groan and writhe in exaggerated fashion has earned him in some circles acclaim for \"depicting female orgasms\" on-screen, but I found Spelvin's shrieking like a water buffalo in heat to be disastrous, mere camp. Compare it to several of her excellent performances for other directors (including Damiano) and one wonders why Sarno had her overact so obviously here.", "Tina fares even worse: she's supposed to be a traveling bible saleslady employed by American Bible Society (a real-life organization, with headquarters not far from my office on Broadway), and her transition to sexaholic by the time Hamilton and Spelvin get through with her is very poorly directed. It's evidence of a \"who cares?\" attitude Sarno took to the dozens & dozens of hardcore movies & videos he directed and thoroughly disowned, but which remain part & parcel of his career (even though apologists choose to dismiss them).", "Although it is the Spelvin/Russell incest that is meant as the story's climax, much attention is given to a May/December romance between Central Park guitarist Davey Jones and Spelvin. Jones, who had a brief career lasting just a year, appearing in many important NY movies like ILLUSIONS OF A LADY, NOT JUST ANOTHER WOMAN and MADAME ZENOBIA, is convincingly very young looking, sporting tons of acne. Makeup effects maybe?? Just kidding.", "Hamilton's overacting here is pitiful, and her hirsute styling (not just legs & crotch but heavy under the armpits) is a turnoff. Sarno surprisingly cast her again in his softcore comedy THE SWITCH, who knows why.", "Sarno belabors the climactic orgy scene interminably, adding to the film's quite bloated 93 minute running time (70 minutes was the norm at this point in porn history, or 55 minutes for a 1-day wonder). His editing is poor, with some shots out of sequence (watch for a false start insert of Central Park late in the day), some orgy master shots repeated ad infinitum, and the previously mentioned sloppy inclusion of completely extraneous scenes, notably Gillis's and Stevens's. ", "The dialog, including pointlessly dirty talk, is poor, but at least generally avoids the ad libbing so common to films of this era, esp. where Gillis and Stevens were concerned.", "The happy ending is as phony as a 3-dollar bill. I took its supposed \"irony\" to be merely Joe thumbing his nose at the audience."]},

She's much better in bed, going from a plain Jane in glasses to quite a turn-on beauty with large nipples as headlights.", "Film's rather lame twists have Nita filing for divorce and having sex with her lawyer Richard (Dave Ruby, who sheds his usual masochist role to be mighty aggressive here, treating Nita -under protest- to some very well-photographed anal sex on his office carpet). After Richard's copious money shot, Nita flees back to reconcile with her hubby.

Bud Lee directed both in tongue-in-cheek fashion, but missed the boat on this one.", "In the 21st Century we are used to the movie concept of \"rebooting\", as adapted from the world of computers, in which movie concepts are regurgitated with some tweaking. What Christi has done, alongside scripter Carl Esser and helmer Lee is to re-jigger the story and characters in a fairly confusing way, and then louse up the needed transition from one film to the other.", "\"Deep South\" was about sisters Kylie Ireland and Anna Malle, living with a white-suited \"Big Daddy\" styled Southern patriarch played by Mike Horner. He inherited the family plantation Whispering Walnuts after marrying their late mom.", "In \"Sex Southern Style\", Malle is still a central character but has different sisters: Christi Lake and Missy, both of whom appeared in the other film but in different roles. Kylie is absent, and Bud Lee's wife Asia Carrera has a small supporting role.", "While Malle was married to (now missing from the script) Nick East in the other film, here she is engaged to Horner (rather than being his step-daughter), the marriage just two weeks away. If that's not confusing enough, John Decker, who was Kylie's love interest in the other movie, is back as a different character this time, ready and willing to have sex with the lovely ladies.", "Esser's script has a lot of amusing Southern films references, hammily applied by a cast having fun with their fake Southern accents. One scene establishes the time frame as 1965, as Horner discusses the impending \"invasion of Beatles\", referring not to local bugs but rather the Fab Four's upcoming concert at Shea Stadium. ", "Sexual infighting and treachery is not much fun in this film, though the able cast provides quality sex scenes, especially Malle delivering an out-door d.p. Unfortunately the feature has no ending, just leaving the viewer hanging, as if there were another film in this fake trilogy. But of course, the 2 extant films do not really go together, but play more like a repertory theater in which many of the players adopt new roles for a new production, though quite similar to the ones they've just essayed.", "Horner gets some sex this time after merely acting in the other feature, and exec producer Lake's role is much more significant in this one.

The sex is extremely hot and includes considerable tease which adds flavor to the expected (and mandatory) XXX interludes.", "Storyline gets a bit far out concerning Decker's role as Bobby WIiker. He walks hesitantly with a cane and complains of a groin injury and has to put up with Horner's verbal abuse, the rest of which is saved to criticize good for nothing Nick East. Carl Esser's interesting script has many off-beat touches, such as emphasizing that guest Wilker is put up in the former slave quarters on the property. Both potential racial and incest issues were set up in my mind, but neither comes to pass during the film.", "Ultimately Wilker is sent to Horner's lavish brothel, where he is serviced by that tall drink of water Christi Lake in a fine scene, after which he's cured of impotence and throws away his cane!

When the chorus girls and headliner Sparkle aren't singing and dancing, they're servicing the leather-cowboy patrons.

When gang leader Jock `rapes' Sparkle in his apartment already full of `whiskey-laden, naked' bodies, his jealous, white-trash girlfriend, Brenda (comparable to actress Yvette Mimieux), spills the beans about Beth Sue (Sparkle) and her non-sensual, highly dramatic Mom. This info allows Jock to blackmail Buster and seize control of his tavern. Jock sends an invitation to Mrs. Blake for a free night at the tavern...", "`Sparkle's Tavern' is a lusty, bizarre, sexually-dripping marvel of the emotional dangers in a dysfunctional family crippled with secrets and lost passions. Marion Eaton as Mrs. Blake is the marvelously pinched backbone of this body of decadence and Dionysian mania. After the `enlightenment,' Buster is stunned that his kooky, closed mother comes to his tavern. She brings a mysterious guest, Mr. Pupik (`pupik' is Yiddish for belly button), who sings revealing jingles and eats things like Christmas candy wrapped in slices of olive loaf.", "Several incest references unfold. There's a terrific scene where the mother, emotionally inside herself, slides onto the kitchen floor, and in her print dress flows through a protracted orgasm; it's at first hilarious, then embarrassing, then glorious! Although her wish was granted instantaneously (she relived her entire life, this time without moral stresses), the orgasm was a kind of residue from the experience. Now everyone else wants to try it!", "Director Curt McDowell died of AIDS in June 1987. Primary shooting of the film was done in two months in 1976, but it took eight years to finance and finish. An NEA grant finally secured McDowell's film. It was meant to open at the 1984 Seattle International Film Festival (SIFF), but the print and borrowed projectors couldn't play the film and the premiere was a disaster. It returned to San Francisco but has never before been shown in the Northwest. 1992's new premiere was the time to see this film, and it makes sense that it took so long. The complex moral issues of AIDS threaten to dam up our sexualities. Let this film pull the plug!", "McDowell preferred to make sex films. Actor and fellow filmmaker George Kuchar told me that McDowell `had lost interest in the film because it didn't have hard-core pornography.' The four-stall fellatio scene is still highly suggestive - and hilarious! The `rape' scene is undeniably sexy, especially with the others crawling on the floor. Said Kuchar, `Curt was unhappy about casting his sister, Melinda, as Sparkle, because he felt she trailed off in her dialogue and singing.' Melinda's Sparkle comes off as lethargic and highly eroticized -- a kind of schoolgirl Mae West, superlative to David Lynch's `Laura Palmer' of `Twin Peaks.'", "Kuchar also said McDowell wrote the clever, cliché-parodying story while high on acid in Yosemite National Park. The film is autobiographical, with Buster representing McDowell. Its humor, nerve and unconscious logic blow away the strangling, goof-ball irrelevancies of dubiously avant-garde filmmakers John Waters and Andy Warhol. Masturbation for McDowell is part of a sexual catalog, not a closed system of self-conscious art.", "`Sparkle's Tavern' is also visually dense. Unlike McDowell's previous film of shadows on white walls (`Thundercrack') the sets here - all built in a loft - are crowded with rambling wallpapers covered with flowers, fruit, or significantly, wide-eyed children dressed as adults.", "The moral is to find relaxation in the release of moral turpitude by separating judgement from sexuality.

Most successful at the time was the wild 'n' wacky Jennifer Welles vehicle LITTLE ORPHAN SAMMY, but Godfrey Daniels' SPIRIT OF SEVENTY-SEX proved superior in almost every respect and has stood the test of time remarkably well. \"Godfrey Daniels\", posing here as both of the equally fictitious \"Krelmn Sisters\" (\"Rikki\" & \"Michelle\" for all you trivia fans out there), has since been revealed as TV producer Stu Segall, the man behind such popular shows as HUNTER and THE CHRONICLE. In another life, he was one of the most talented yet  ironically  unsung directors of dirty movies best known for his '80s Marilyn Chambers classics INSATIABLE and UP 'N' COMING. Prior to these show ponies, he had already perpetrated a number of cult favorites fondly remembered by true longtime genre fans like the ludicrously titled but highly entertaining TEENY BUNS with Nancy Hoffman and her little friends discovering the joys of play for pay or the equally effective SUMMER SCHOOL with the late lamented Laurien Dominique trading her maidenhead for passing grades at her new college.

Sandi Pinney (who made an impression as Caroline, the woman who unwittingly inspires Annette Haven's descent into depravity in Gary Graver's superlative V  THE HOT ONE) has an all time Sapphic bit with achingly pretty Gail Lawrence a/k/a \"Abigail Clayton\" in the barn before being ravished by the Minute Men, played by Jon Martin (star of Harold Perkins' HOT LUNCH and a solid supporting stud well into the '90s), Radio Ray Wells (John Leslie's hapless cab driver colleague in Svetlana's \"F\") and Clay Hyde (one of the \"Magnificent Seven\" in Antonio Shepherd's 7 INTO SNOWY, though he had already done some orgy stuff in the Mitchell Bros. early '70s classic RESURRECTION OF EVE).", "Perhaps because it's such infectious, at times positively anarchistic fun, liberally sprinkled with anachronisms, and everyone appears to be enjoying themselves too much to be labeled \"professional\", it might seem easy to dismiss the finer points of film-making Segall so deftly exhibits. Evocative lighting (usually described as \"too dark\" by current carnal critics) and smooth camera-work combine with flawless editing rhythmically set to another superb, song-packed \"Long John\" soundtrack to assure one of the more visually appealing and perfectly paced porno picks of the era. For the record, \"Long John\" (or \"John Long\" or any possible permutation thereof) were actually two mainstream songwriters whose services Segall frequently called upon. If additional proof were needed that terrific music can greatly enhance an already solid sex scene, one need look no further than this immensely enjoyable gem of a movie."]},

Whether quoting Herman J.

A narcotics detective attached to an unnamed large metropolitan police department, Nick Harris (Stan Morse), has receipted for grievous personal losses, of his wife, a shooting victim during an apparent carjacking, and of his detective partner, the latter slain by a gang of obviously organized thugs, all wearing full-length black dusters and wielding fully automatic machine guns. As if this were not enough, his Department's Internal Affairs unit is intending to implicate him in his partner's death by alleging dereliction of duty. The black coat gang is composed of Russian immigrants, engaged in the illegal trade of automatic weapons, headed by a former KGB Colonel, Ivan Romanov (Christopher Mitchum). Detective Harris, who has glumly been going about his now partnerless duties, is tasked with bringing the mob of Slavic triggermen to heel, assisted by a newly assigned sidekick, John Burke (Jeff Blanchard), who has requested his transfer from Homicide Division to his Narcotics post, holding a presumption that more exciting fare would be his with the change. Burke demonstrates a more lively demeanour than does Harris, for which a viewer will be grateful, but the two face a sizable problem in corraling the Russian mobsters, as their Department is clearly offering nothing in the way of assistance. Romanov's viciousness is not made completely clear through the storyline due to overzealous cutting that serves to highlight the film's shortcomings of continuity but, notwithstanding this drawback, one can hold little uncertainty as to the fate of Harris and Burke, as hundreds of armour piercing rounds fired at close range in their direction are plainly able to wriggle harmlessly around them. This work will provide only a tedious viewing experience for most, a flabby attempt at creating an action tale with humorous asides, while having the lowest of budgets. Morse and Blanchard used it as a means to accomplish a change of occupation by joining an improvisational comedy company. Even avid devotees of lower level \"B\" films will be sorely tested by watching this one unfold through to its ending. However, in all fairness, one must acknowledge that the somewhat inexperienced players of this extraordinarily tatty work go about their business with earnestness, only to be undone by a weak script and direction. The film was completed quickly, in less than two weeks, shot in Dallas and Tia Juana, Mexico and, while not shown in United States theatres, it has been very popular in Europe and in Asia."]},

STUD HUNTERS is one such example. Barely a story, it's still dynamite porn, and showcases Suze at the height of her abilities.", "Throwaway narrative finds corpulent porn producer Harry Huge haranguing centerfold photographer Randy Fox (Misty Regan, credited here as Misty Mallory) to send him more boy-girl pics, since her previous output has been largely sapphic. Enlisting several of her past models to scrounge up male talent, Randy sets the template for the film, which follows the girls around LA as they perform some very in-depth talent scouting.", "Not even bothering to wrap up its storyline with a concluding photo shoot, the film's major flaw is that it just peters out, ending by resolving a problem that was never established (Randy scoring some dynamite sex for herself). Along the way, however, Suze treats the viewer to a succession of scorching sex scenes. Only the first is a clunker, sadistically pairing Desiree Lane, perhaps the prettiest girl in the cast, with rotund Michael Morrison, who looks like he wandered in off the set of a misbegotten one-day wonder. I certainly felt for poor Desiree, playing a young starlet hoping to get her break by servicing an unattractive schlub, but in the end it was hard for me to determine whether this scene - in a film called STUD HUNTERS - constitutes a greater betrayal of the actress or audience.", "Much better is a sapphic bout between Regan and one of her models, cross-cut with a hetero encounter featuring Pippi Anderson and Marc \"Million Movies\" Wallice. Both encounters generate great heat, and Randall photographs them lovingly, coaxing energetic, erotic performances out of her cast and shooting them with aplomb.", "Even better - and perhaps the movie's highlight - is the subsequent encounter between Anderson and five (!) guys at a Venice gym, where Pippi takes on all cummers with absolute gusto. A truly torrid sequence, it highlights the fact that great porn needn't involve tremendously complicated story or characters, as long as it delivers on what the genre promises - great, panting sex with a cast of enthusiastic participants. That all subsequent bouts pale by comparison is inevitable, but Randall nevertheless manages to keep up the heat, making this a (very loosely) plot-based flick that's worth sticking out to the end. It may not set the world on fire, but STUD HUNTERS is a lovely diamond-in-the-rough for classic porn fans, courtesy of one of the genre's most unfairly overlooked talents."]},

Given a lead by Adams, Sugar heads out to a secretarial interview with the guy's employer, who offers her a clue to his whereabouts in exchange for the right kind of \"persuasion.\"", "After phoning the info to her boss, Sugar gets raped by her next source, and is forced to crawl home for some Sapphic rehabilitation with her roommate. Finally tracking down her target (a still very young Mike Ranger, future star of Kirdy Stevens' TABOO), Sugar and the guy develop a fledgling romance as she begins to realize he's just down on his luck. Can their love survive the circumstances behind their meeting, or will Sugar ultimately prove her loyalty is to the mob?", "While not quite as threadbare as the shot-in-a-single-house variety of storefront feature, SUGAR IN THE RAW is still only a minor step up, with minimal production values and little interest ever demonstrated in its whisper-thin plot (Ranger, Sugar's quarry, isn't even introduced until the third act, and any \"information\" gleaned in her investigation is a nonsensical MacGuffin simply meant to move the story along). Still, despite its abysmal failings as a thriller, the film at least contains enough hot sex to recommend as porn. The opening scene with Adams, for instance, is very well done, with good lighting and cinematography and some expert cocksmanship that places this above the level of the average grinder. Ranger similarly reveals why he would ascend to star status, not merely owing to his impressive organ but, again, an ability to make good (and photogenic) use of it. While the inconsequentiality of the plot means the film inevitably drags (particularly during the gratuitous and pretty tasteless post-rape lesbian toward the middle), the strength of the performances and the film's technical capacity still land it a notch above competition. It may not be great art, but it's pretty good porn, and sometimes that's enough."]},

In the case of \"Summer of '72\" - that borrowed the title from the famous Robert Mulligan's \"Summer of '42\" - we can see a wonderful and delightful surprise. First, the actors. Annette Haven, star of the unforgettable \"The Opening of Misty Beethoven\" (1976), portrays a mid-aged woman who meets a timid and insecure teenager (Richard Pacheco). The couple performs the final scene love and, for my surprise, it was not a disgusting and mechanical sex scene, but a very passionate one. It seems that the actors truly understood the spirit of the plot and, for sure, made a marvelous happy ending. Also in the cast, Paul Thomas plays Richard's best friend, a not-so-good companion, who likes to tease him with the expression \"chunk\". Second, the plot. Intelligent, as good as its mentor. This time we have the opportunity to see not only fake actors doing the same old thing, but players who try - and get it - to show a little bit of interpretation. Third, it's an old-fashioned movie.

For more info, check out the other comment and color me  for one  impressed ! Allow me to fill you in on some of the additional details as to some of the people on both sides of the camera. Director \"Carl LaBlanche\" was actually the late John Christopher, a modestly talented filmmaker responsible for flicks like BABE and VELVET HIGH. Cinematographer \"Anna Riva\" proves to be none other than exploitation queen Roberta Findlay and I've got a hunch that producer \"J. Angel Martine\", linked to so many of her directorial efforts, might be yet another alias for the lady herself. Everyone involved has done much better elsewhere but the cult reputation of many should assure a good deal of interest for the adult film aficionado and/or completist.", "Brunette Arcadia Lake and blonde Jean Jennings (the one time Mrs. Joe Spinell and unforgettable star of Armand Weston's incredible DEFIANCE) are high school girls on their last day of summer vacation. As they get bored waiting for their boyfriends to show up, they put on a disco record (a picture disc, actually, remember those ?) and shake their booty while stripping down. Can a lesbo liaison be far behind ? Nah ! I've got to admit the double dong (something dad brought back from his trip to Europe, Arcadia explains, which kind of makes you wonder about the guy) came as a bit of a surprise though. It certainly does to the girls' paramours (stalwart studs Eric Edwards and Ron Hudd) who are sneaking a peek through the window, snapping shots for the school paper ! Once they make their presence known, the movie reverts to the \"loop carrier\" format as Edwards relates how his passion for photography landed him into various types of trouble whenever he turned his lens towards naked ladies. Cue the introduction of the film's biggest star, in more ways than one, the late great John Curtis Holmes who plays Captain Tom, owner of the \"Chug-a-Lug\", a lovely little yacht that doesn't have to leave the harbor to give you motion sickness, if you catch my drift ! First up is a below deck orgy centered around pretty, part Native American (so her lead in Ann Perry's rather silly SWEET SAVAGE wasn't a total put-on) Beth Anna who's covered in whipped cream as she's being mauled by Edwards, Al Levitsky a/k/a \"Roger Caine\", Shaun Costello's \"Dan McCord\" alter ego. There's another barely glimpsed actress in this scene, blink and you'll be unable to identify her as Clea Carson, the stewardess living across the street from pervert Jamie Gillis in WATERPOWER, who performs here with massively endowed Peter Andrews, the waiter with Susan McBain in Radley Metzger's BARBARA BROADCAST.", "Legendary Serena is easy enough to identify. She plays \"Candy Johnson\" and, boy oh boy, she certainly likes short shorts ! She performs two scenes with the humongously hung Holmes (one on the boat and one outdoors) and while neither ranks among her all time hottest true genre fans will not want to miss out on this superstar combination. The leads get it on next. Exotic Arcadia (who died of a drug overdose some years later) works with then real life boyfriend Eric while Jean, looking a lot like Melissa Joan Hart (TV's SABRINA), has Ron. While she did scenes with other women, Arcadia was pretty much a one man woman, meaning she was usually a second stringer. Whenever she did play the lead, it was usually in some low rent production like this or HONEY THROAT, Jeff Fairbanks' terrific American PIE proving an exception to the rule. To fill out the brief running time, Edwards tells of how he caught his brother in flagrante with his black girlfriend. This was obviously some loop that had been lying around and it's impossible to identify who's in it as there's not a single facial close-up as to preserve anonymity ! Shots of Eric snapping away are inserted but the striking difference in picture quality reveals that he was most definitely never in the same room."]},

Go figure. Story is pre-Viagra, as James R. Sweeney pressures his lovely wife Jan Mitchell to go with him to swingers' parties, to spice up their love life.

Wifey is a huge hit, humping all the guys there in succession, while Sweeney can't get it up at all with Marsha Jordan and just downs his sorrows with booze the rest of the evening. Humiliated he vows revenge and starts murdering all the other swingers.", "This unpalatable premise throws the film into standard thriller mode, but minus the thrills. James R. Sweeney's flat performance in the central role is completely incompetent, and his miscasting merely becomes more & more evident: it would be comparable to casting Peter Riegert or Michael Lerner instead of Michael Rooker as HENRY: PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER. The only explanation is obvious: vanity production.", "Making the film worse is the tiresome and frankly idiotic procedural details of the cops on the case. Sweeney has painstakingly been shown from the beginning to be chums with them, so even these stupidos finally figure out that he's the mass murderer. I was completely bored out of my gourd by the time we belatedly reached the final freeze frame and the band came on screen to sing us out with a reprise of \"Filthy McNasty\".", "There is a lesson in all this: don't hire Rene Bond and Uschi Digard to cameo in your movie with their clothes on!"]},

For the record, his wife Tina – one of the earliest genre superstars - was responsible for editing and make-up. Neither one appears on screen on this occasion yet they had been the stars of Weston's maiden effort PERSONALS from 1972. Though Christina would seem to adhere to a certain exploitation sub-genre centering on violation and subsequent retribution, Weston and Russell cleverly subvert audience expectations at every turn, creating a work as compellingly singular as their previous collaboration. ", "An opening title card informs that the movie we're about to witness was inspired by true events taking place in the state of California on the first three days of October 1974. Titular Christina (lovely brunette Bree Anthony, star of Lloyd Kaufman's DIVINE OBSESSION, in a career-best performance) is the virginal bride to be of handsome if growing somewhat impatient Larry (Jack Thompson, looking rather like current mainstream actor Paul Rudd) whose ardor she is quick to dampen at the heavy petting stage. Unbeknownst to the happy couple, a pair of petty thugs are knocking over a gas station nearby, loose cannon Frank (a pre-Dan McCord Roger Caine billed under his real name Al Levitsky) accidentally icing the elderly attendant (Daniel Fitzgerald) in the process. Making a run for it with his more levelheaded partner Sonny (Eric Edwards, whose amazing career on both sides of the cameras extends to this very day), the pair wind up at a sleazy bar where good-natured prostitute Mary Jo (Terri Hall, star of Gerard Damiano's STORY OF JOANNA) tried to chat up blue-balls Larry just moments before. She and gal pal Louise (C.J. Laing for once not cast as a victim) hook up with the bad guys, resulting in some truly excellent three-way action (with Laing doing her deep throat specialty) once the too intense Frank angrily backs out. The latter apparently doesn't like to pay for what he assumes he can get for free anyway. So sweet innocent Christina, waiting for her boyfriend outside the movie theater where she works, is abducted for this particular purpose. Dragged off to the house they've broken into (with its rightful owners conveniently absent), Christina's brutally (if non-explicitly) abused by nasty Frank who rushes out for booze right after. Leaving the girl tied to the bed, Sonny proceeds to clean her up and gently perform cunnilingus before penetrating her as well. Though shot like a love scene (with soft lighting and romantic guitar music), this still amounts to rape given the non-consensual circumstances. To further confuse the audience, this sequence is cross-cut with an equally tender encounter between Larry (who thinks he has been stood up) and Mary Jo. Following her ordeal, Christina appears to have a change of heart as she comes on to her captors, urging them to take her along. Has the girl got a major case of Stockholm syndrome all of a sudden ? Is she trying to escape by putting the two men up against each other ? See and find out.", "Professionally shot by the pseudonymous but hardworking \"Harry Flecks\" (actually Joao Fernandez, who incidentally shot most of Damiano's classics as well as the cult favorite THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS), this looks as good as any Hollywood indie production of the period. What really sets it apart though is the remarkably thoughtful screenplay offering rare opportunities for in-depth characterization to a talented cast. Anthony, who'd been mauled by villain extraordinaire Jamie Gillis only the previous year in Claude Goddard's WINTER HEAT, moves from vacuous virgin to scheming angel of vengeance with utter credibility. Levitsky and Edwards make for a contrasting pair of hoodlums, the latter providing a neatly subversive twist on his usually being cast as Mr. Sensitivity. Most surprising to me is Terri Hall's sympathetic turn as the kind and classy lady of the night, a part that could easily have taken a turn to Cliché City. A trivia in-joke occurs when her character tantalizingly strips for Larry and he remarks on how well she moves and asks if she's a dancer. Though she smiles and denies this, in real life Hall had of course been a member of the Stuttgart ballet. After DEFIANCE and Christina, Weston pretty much abandoned this type of edgy, risk-taking material. Unsurprisingly, this led to an amount of (postponed) mainstream acceptance with admittedly exceptional films like EXPOSE ME, LOVELY (1976) and, of course, TAKE OFF (1978), both of which are now regarded as prime examples of the genre at its finest."]},

For starters, the cinematography is absolutely gorgeous! And I truly appreciated all the exterior location shots, the sets, and high production values. They are by far the best thing about this movie.", "The plot? Who cares. Honestly, to me this film was most enjoyable just watching John Holmes wander around downtown San Francisco as it was in 1976. It's amazing how much things have changed (or not)! Like, watch Johnny go the corner of Larkin and McAllister to pick up a newspaper. Then watch him go into the Public Library (now the Asian Art Museum). Afterward, watch him wander down the 400 Block of O'Farrell past all sorts of seedy escort services and porn shops, long since gone. Watch him cruise around in his awesome 1975 Caprice convertible land yacht. Watch him follow Desiree West up to her Nob Hill Condominium high-rise (1170 Sacramento Street). Then watch him visit the home of the sinister Black Widow (2104 Broadway). Finally, watch him mope around the marina after the case is solved.", "As Johnny Wadd, Holmes struts around, acts tough, slaps chicks, shoots bad guys, delivers his lines impatiently, and mutters needless obscenities under his breath at the end of each conversation. Sharon Thorpe as the Black Widow wildly overacts (intentionally), screeching loud enough to burst eardrums. Desiree West was beautiful and by far the best actor in this movie. Awesome view from her condo! Annette Haven looked good, too. Luckily by then she did away with her ridiculously thin and arched \"David Ferrie\" eyebrows that she sported in her earlier roles. Leslie Bovee looked great in a bikini. I was never a John Leslie fan, though -- his reptilian eyes always creep me out.", "Anyway, \"Tapestry of Passion\" is most enjoyable viewed as a travelogue or time-capsule, as well as seeing the cast in their prime. I'd give it a 5."]},

Alas, she's devoutly Christian, which means not only that she won't put out before marriage, but that Aaron's totally out of the question because he's Jewish. Enter local mad scientist Dr. Folkoff, who's working on a pill to eliminate socio-sexual inhibition (specifically the negative influences of culture and religion that lead people to avoid expanding their sexual boundaries). After being treated to a couple demonstrations of the pill in effect (presumably some of the repurposed footage, which features a young Jamie Gillis!), Aaron slips the pill in both his and his coworker's drinks one evening and soon finds the two of them making love on one of the factory's fabric stations.

Anchored by a fantastic, probably 8-minute rock song that repeats (almost in its entirety) twice, the final 15 or 20 minutes are essentially a nonstop orgy, mostly repurposed from LOVELAND, though with careful integration of the new actors on the sidelines.

That the film presents this idea in such a jokey register while also seeming to take it semi-seriously produces a perfect balance between pie-eyed idealism and genuine desire for change: maybe we would all be happier if we let go of our hang-ups and just got it on. It's not exactly a nuanced or subtle thesis, but it's welcome in a genre that can too often tend toward the empty-headed or cynical.", "Ultimately, your tolerance for OVERCOME will come down to your patience for this kind of naivety, along with your general appreciation for the film's fluffy, frothy aesthetic. It's not high art, but it's a whole lot of fun, and a genuine turn-on to boot. For a sex film, what more do you want?"]},

That's My Daughter is an example of why film was not always better than video. It wastes the erotic potential of a great cast with over-tight editing and short clippy sex scenes. The plot was a quite interesting and humorous satire of George C. Scott's film, Hardcore. We can't be too let down when Harry's lover in a snowy mountain cabin is Lisa Deleuw. She's given enough screen time. Karen Sweet needed more development in the title role. Her scenes were hot but clipped short too fast. Edwards is fine as a clown private eye, drunk and after Arcadia Lake most of the time. Sharon Mitchell does well as his partner, exploring a few scenes of bondage which were her expert area.

Here is Reems at the beginning of his career, sans mustache but still possessing that on screen charisma that would carry him through his illustrious showbiz career. \"Time To Love' is one of those \"real movie' porn flicks; it has a solid story, good camera work, and a respectable budget. Basically a morality tale, it's purpose is to glorify the institution of marriage and monogamy. And although the idea of a porn film praising marriage and monogamy is utterly bizarre, it works. This is a thoroughly enjoyable \"buddy movie,\" that begins at a college reunion, where two college friends, Ned and John, get together after 10 years and compare notes on their lives. As they wander around NYC they visit restaurants and bars while they reminisce about their past and current lives. Ned has become an amazingly successful tv news anchorman, whose celebrity status has allowed him a life of international travel, and an endless supply of bed mates. Flashbacks of Swinging London and Japan of the 1960's are used to great effect, and they blend seamlessly with the erotic scenes, of which there are enough, but not as many as you would expect. Harry Reems plays John, the \"nice guy,\" down to Earth, and happily married with two cute kids, and an ideal home life. Reems played a similar character in Andy Milligan's \"Fleshpot On 42nd Street\" a few years later. The first half of this charming flick covers the past lives of both guys, and the second half is rooted firmly in the present, when John invites Ned to his home out on Staten Island. At this point the movie switches gears, and becomes even better. After bragging about the \"wonderful life of a bachelor.\" Ned begins to doubt his life choices as he sees his buddy, at home with his beautiful wife, surrounded by their kids, and all things domestic. The final erotic scene between Reems and his wife is the centerpiece of the film. it's quite a beautiful scene, filmed artfully, and scored with music that is haunting and romantic. It's a very long sex scene, but never feels exploitative or \"dirty\" at all..something that is unheard of within the Adult film genre. \"Time To Love\" is such an odd obscurity, and a true relic of the genre. In 1970 NYC, there were hippies gathered in Washington Square Park, Vietnam was in full swing, and the transition from the happy and peace loving 60's, to the darker, more pessimistic 1970's, was taking place in every major city..and this film captures that time in a fascinating way. I think this is an utterly fascinating movie, for many different reasons. Recommended to anyone interested in the \"Golden Age\" of Adult film, as this is definitely one of the truly obscure titles. Also for Reems fanatics, this is his first starring role, and he is fantastic in it. This must surely be a collectors item."]},

Davis Smith's TO TURN A TRICK, a porn film that tried to be different but is merely incompetent. His MOS-shot ALL MY MEN was impressive, but this subsequent stab at directing a talkie is embarrassing.", "You'd never know it from the superlatives on the SWV box liner written by self-appointed \"film historian\" Casey. Throwing around such hype as \"underrated gem\", \"unique art house aesthetic\" and \"unique, fascinating journey\" reveal him to be a 100% shillmeister. If one consults these listings prior to making a purchase (I don't), simply interpret the opposite to all of Casey's comments and you will be closer to the truth.", "The film was ground out by Smith for Sam Lake Enterprises, which dealt in porn by the meter, with zero interest in quality. It shows here, as the photography, sound recording and especially the acting & editing are atrocious. In the '70s and '80s exhibitors were always up in arms about the industry-evil of \"blind bidding\" (i.e., distributors would offer major films without permitting the exhibitor to see what he was bidding on), but a film like this one would be shown only at marginal cinemas with ultimately only the projectionist privy to its miscellaneous contents.", "Sinking the enterprise from the outset is the poor casting, as both leads, one-shot \"actors\" Inger Simonsen and Christopher Brennan, have trouble reciting their direct-sound lines with any emotion whatsoever. For a melodrama, having such low-affect performers is a no-no. Brennan portrays a handicapped still photographer named Lee who is thoroughly dislikable, crutching around to capture life in the raw. Early on we see him failing to help a brutally beaten-up guy -he's only interested in snapping shots.", "Scandi import Simonsen is in Manhattan looking for work as a model, but instead becomes Brennan's camera assistant. Thanks to weak scripting, execrable editing (most scenes are truncated by fades or lap-dissolves at just the wrong moment), their characters do not develop, especially Inger (as Inga) with a never-convincing arc to play. Several scenes in the middle of the film are shredded and incoherent -usually missing footage is at the beginning or ending of these salvaged films, but apparently the middle reels were ruined this time.", "--MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD-- ", "Several key scenes are abominably directed. Inger is raped after hours in the studio by a former employee of Lee's, who is evidently high, and has two models there to hold her down. The photography here (praised of course by Casey for being \"shadowy\") is poor so the scene has little impact, and it makes no sense -after several replays and hindsight from a later scene discussing the incident it finally appears that the rapist misunderstood in his stupor that Inga was asking for the $15 back stolen from her purse, when he thought she was offering him sex for a $50 charge. This apparently is the only (and I'm stretching to make a point) way the film's release title could possibly relate to the action/storyline -this is not a film about prostitution.", "Inga's behavior never makes sense but when not stripping for 1967-acceptable levels of nudity, she wanders through the film on a Smith-enforced downward spiral, ultimately dying of an o.d. The callous creep who shoots her up with heroin, cryptically cuts her corpse's hair off (!) and then has a fat slob come to help him dispose of the body, in a ridiculous scene done in once again by the unintelligible sound recording. Film's beyond-cynical ending of Lee's blasé attitude when asked later about Inga: \"I suppose she went back to Norway\" backfires. It's not a hip, downbeat ending but rather another porn Freudian slip -Smith has a \"who cares?\" attitude towards the entire mess, and so will the (not on the payroll like Casey) arm's length viewer.", "I recently watched Smith's FILE X FOR SEX, also ground out by him for Sam Lake in 1967, but shot MOS. In that film the ultra-busty Yolanda Signorelli makes a stimulating impression as a masseuse, but in TO TURN A TRICK she is made to look ugly by the poor cinematography in a nothing role as one of the girls who holds rape victim Inga down. Just an example of carelessness for this intended to be ephemeral '60s porn. Who woulda thunk that 30 to 50 years later creeps calling themselves experts would be praising it the skies with a presumably straight face?"]},

The love story aspect isn't that believable but it's far from bad.", "I wouldn't say Starr gave a \"good\" performance but it's at least good enough for this type of film.

The bucolic setting adds romance to a simple threesome, with Gerry Pike the lucky recipient of some 2 on 1 dick action. I enjoyed this idyll immensely.", "But as other IMDb reviewers have already noted, star power is what gets folks attention, even more so now but certainly two decades back when Vivid was in its ascendancy. ", "Clearly, the lesbian 3-way match-up of contract girls Racquel Darrian and Nikki Tyler with the beautiful less-sung Madelyn Knight is a powerful vignette titled \"The Gift\", especially since PT emphasizes acting, dialog and a nice edge, rather than falling back on all-sex. It has a fine ending too, as we learn that what seemed like genuine drama and conflict was merely habitual role-playing as the scene is turned on its head.", "Darrian also stars in \"Three on a Match\", opposite her man Derrick Lane, who thereby doesn't need to wear a condom. It's a well-directed fantasy threesome with Jon Dough the third wheel (wearing a condom), and also has a nice trick ending.", "Most peculiar of the four segments is \"The Guest Room\", a bit structurally unsound, but stimulating nonetheless. The least porn-star like of the Vivid girls Melissa Hill (and perhaps the label's best actress) is the mysterious inhabitant of a couple's guest room, in a tantalizing and in its own way suspenseful tale of the \"what is real, what is fantasy?\" mode. Hill and Missy provide plenty of sexual heat, though casting Alex Sanders was, for me at least, a turn-off."]},

O'Brien was always a likable leading man, and, as everyone knows, was popular in the late-silent, early-talkie era. He is noteworthy for his role in Murnau's \"Sunrise.\" He did much of his best work for John Ford, who seemed to be a kind of guardian angel for him. When his career was running out of steam, Ford put him in supporting roles in some of his later films. If what you read is true, O'Brien must hold some kind of military record. Aside from being a boxing champ in the navy, he fought in WWI, WWII, Korea, and Vietnam, and was highly decorated in those wars. He's good here as the cocky government attorney, determined to get his man. ", "The story segues from a light adventure yarn into a sort of variation of \"The Sea Wolf.\" The actors playing the cutthroats on the ship our heroes encounter are pretty convincing. Particularly William Hall, who plays the captain. I'm not familiar with him, and he seems to have had a career playing small parts and bits. He's good, though, and convincing as a ruthless, piratical type. I'm not familiar with most of the actors here, though in a way that makes it more convincing, as they seem like real-life types. After O'Brien, and leading lady Constance Worth, the best known actor here is probably Gavin Gordon. He attained some kind of screen immortality by playing Lord Byron in the classic \"The Bride of Frankenstein.\" And he played that part very well. He also appeared in \"The Mystery of the Wax Museum,\" and dozens of other films, usually as a nasty, bullying villain (see \"The Silver Horde,\" 1930, with Joel McCrea). ", "This isn't a great film by any means, but it is fun, and is the kind of sea adventure that you don't see anymore. For sailing ship fans, it is a treat as well. There are plenty of shots of 30s- era yachts, motor boats, and sailing ships, the kinds of ships that you don't see around the world any longer, except perhaps in offbeat locations. Places like the islands of Indonesia, or harbors in Djakarta. You really can see these vintage vessels in such places, and not as museum pieces, but as working ships. If you can't get to those places in reality, films like this might be of interest."]},

TV was clearly seriously impacting the studio's bottom line. Murphy initially tells audience--- without ever mentioning the one-eyed monster overtly--- that the theater the audience is in is worthy of it's continued patronage, with reminders of war bond drives (true--- theaters were responsible for selling millions in bonds and stamps during WWII), technological innovations (the recently abandoned 3-D isn't mentioned) and all-around spectacle. The personable George Murphy then peeks around the lot (which is highly staged and artificial) to see what's shooting; several productions are spotlighted. Unfortunately 1955 was a far from terrific year for the studio. The only really interesting sequence for me is the one showing 3 seconds of director King Vidor setting up a shot for \"Love Me of Leave Me\" with a glimpse of Jimmy Cagney getting on his mark. It's kind of sad to see Gene Kelley posturing about \"It's Always Fair Weather\" not realizing it was essentially the last of the MGM musicals of the 50's and arguably one of Kelley's lesser and least-seen efforts (okay, not counting 1980's roller-disco fantasy fiasco \"Xanadu\"). This 2-reel promo is probably best seen with your brain engaged, thinking about why it was made at all and is more significant for what it doesn't say. While several other studios also viewed TV as the enemy, MGM had more to lose in it's stance. It had lost it's theater franchise and hadn't had a truly profitable multi-year streak since 1946. 1955 would be one short year away from the wholesale collapse of the old studio system, something Metro should have seen coming when it cut loose the majority of it's stars five years earlier."]},

And since I have not read the book, therefore I will evaluate the film adaptation as an independent work. For the first time I got acquainted with this masterpiece of Soviet cinema at a young age, being still an ardent anti-Soviet (I am not proud of this fact of my biography), and then I did not worry much about the Reds, but I remembered the picture, and even then I revised it more than once. And so, years later, having straightened my brains and lived my life, becoming a communist, I decided to reconsider this picture again - and only now I realized its greatness and its significance, and its splendor, and its masterpiece, and its depth, of course. And here's my brief opinion - the Invisible front of the Civil War. I will note right away that there is not a single minus in the picture, but there are more than enough pluses for the highest rating. Therefore, I will finish with the introduction and move on to these very advantages.", "So, here they are:\n1. The scenario is 1919. South of Russia. A civil war is raging with might and main. The Whites under the command of General Denikin are preparing for a decisive offensive in order to defeat the Red Army and take Moscow. The southern front of the Reds is bursting at the seams. Only a miracle can save them, and it was at this time that, by order of the Cheka, a scout Pavel Koltsov was sent to Kharkov, where the headquarters of the Volunteer Army is located, with the task of penetrating into the location of the whites and finding out secret information of interest to the Chekists. Not without incident, but Captain Koltsov gets to Kharkov, and becomes none other than the adjutant of the commander of the Volunteer Army, Lieutenant General Vladimir Zenonovich Kovalevsky (May-Mayevsky). And after that, the battle of intelligence began, because it turns out that there is also a spy in the headquarters of the Southern Front of the Reds in Kiev, who delivers secret information to the whites. The stakes are rising, because there will still be romance, and a few more scenario lines that run parallel. All this is intertwined with the real historical events of those years, and of course the finale. Certainly sad, but also victorious at the same time. The fact that the picture was disassembled into quotations is no longer necessary to say (\"Andreich fell, are you a spy?\", \"It was you, Miron, who killed Pavel\", \"Dim the wick, it smokes\"). Dialogues are my homage. Intrigues - at the highest level, a fight of intelligence - well, I really worried about the red heroes. And despite the five episodes, the picture looks in one breath and will not make you bored. Comrades could write, they could!", "2. Red and white - both sides are represented by people of different social status and different beliefs. It is shown that there were both good and noble people on the white side, and there were scoundrels and skinners, scammers and adventurers. Some of the whites are really pathetic. The reds are shown better, because there is nowhere without ideology, but you believe these reds. Yes, in reality, not all reds were good, and this is a fact. Russian russians were for the Reds, and the interventionists and the bourgeoisie were for the whites, to whom the interests of the Russian people were up to one place, that's why the whites lost. Therefore, the picture cannot be called a \"red agitator\", because it shows living people in a difficult, crucial time for Russia and the whole world, shows and tells about their motives, even the environment where they were brought up and on the basis of which they have exactly such a worldview.", "3. Pavel Koltsov is a complex and heroic character, copied from a real person, but masterfully modified by Yuri Methodevich Solomin. How did it happen that a hereditary nobleman, an officer of the Russian army who had been fighting since 1914, became a red scout? Yes, he just understood his people, for whom he shed blood. He knew and believed that the Bolsheviks would lead the Russian people and the country to prosperity, where everyone would be equal, and that it was necessary to fight for this with those who did not want to establish this justice. And he explained all this by a simple example to his friend and pupil Yura (a nobleman and the son of a nobleman) in a small monologue. This decision was not easy, as was the romantic line, which tormented the hero's soul even more. But do not forget that he is carrying out the task of the Cheka right under the nose of Denikin's counterintelligence, which is ruthless to all enemies of the \"white idea\", and they will always have bullets and ropes for red spies. Pavel Koltsov even reminded me of Maxim Isaev.", "4. The confrontation of the intelligence services - the Cheka against Denikin's counterintelligence. A new special service against veterans of the First World War. The truth is against slavery. Revolutionaries against executioners in uniform. On each side there are both smart people and not so smart, but mistakes in this profession cost hundreds, thousands of lives. Sometimes the whole course of hostilities can turn from a lightning-fast decision. And that's all right here. The Kiev \"white\" underground and the Kharkiv \"red\" are shown as a real acting force that works in the interests of the belligerents, and whose actions and sabotage bring victory closer or, conversely, delay it. On both sides, I act both tactfully and not very much if the caught agent does not agree to cooperate. In this regard, the Cheka really learned some subtleties of work from the Denikins, which allowed them to become the strongest special service in the world already during the Civil War, and then this tradition was continued by the GPU-OGPU-NKVD-NKGB-MGB-KGB.", "5. Atmosphere - despite the fact that there is practically no fighting in the picture, this did not prevent the creators from catching up with the disturbing atmosphere of the Civil War through dialogues, characters, scenery and even music (which is not a frequent guest here). You can especially feel it now that the picture has been restored in high quality, the sound has been tightened and the picture has been improved. In general, the restoration of this painting should become an example to follow, because there are still a lot of Soviet paintings that are waiting for this very restoration, and they all just need it.", "6. Acting - the Soviet acting school is for you \"Stanislavsky I believe!\" on every phrase, in every scene. Actors do not play, but live their characters on the screen. And everything is very convincing. The way they move, the way they speak, the manner of speech - everything emphasizes the social status of a person. Learn modern incompetents!", "A little bit about the main characters:\n1. Captain Pavel Koltsov, played by Yuri Solomin, is a nobleman, a former officer of the Russian Imperial army, who passed the trenches of the First World War, and now is a CHEKA agent with the call sign \"Old Man\", sent to the rear of the whites in order to search for secret information. Charming, brave, somewhat romantic, but true to the ideals of the revolution and ready to do anything in order to complete the task. Yuri Methodevich excellently managed to play this hero, showing his inner world and his thoughts. Bravo Yuri Methodievich! Bravo!", "2. Vladimir Kovalevsky, played by Vladislav Strzhelchik, is a lieutenant general, commander of the Volunteer Army, a monarchist and one of the biggest white bigwigs in the South of Russia, who does not digest the Bolsheviks and their ideas as a class, and at the same time does not understand the Russian people against whom he is fighting. At the same time, he is shown to be quite calm and even a noble man, because in the First World War he fought bravely with the Germans and Austrians. The role of commander was superbly performed by Vladislav Ignatievich Strzhelchik, as always, everything pleased him. Well-deserved bravo!", "3. Yuri Lviv, performed by Alexander Milokostny, is the son of a Russian officer, Colonel Lviv, who has had a hard time, and eventually turns out to be a pupil of Koltsov. During the painting, he undergoes a transformation, and becomes a brave man and understands on whose side the truth is. Alexander Viktorovich was convincing. Well done!", "Interestingly, last time I wrote a review of the painting \"Dauria\" with the younger Solomin, and today I am writing about the \"Adjutant of His Excellency\" with the elder Solomin. I just love both artists, and they chose good pictures.", "What can I say - a masterpiece, without further ado. Take a look if you haven't looked yet, or reconsider if you've forgotten what's there and how.", "My rating is 10 out of 10 and my recommendation for viewing!"]},

If the great filmmaker adores kabuki enough to get its biggest onnagata (male performer in female roles) star into a male role, what's Bando like in his natural habitat? ", "After the mutual admiration/love-fest in the beginning, Yo-yo ma and Bando get down to work. Ma has a personal agenda of reliving the tie he had with his deceased father through the Bach piece, with another prestigious artist. Bando wants to personalize the collaboration only as far as it frees him from the usual narrative constraints of his kabuki plays (this is apparent when Ma tries to link Bando's adoption by the prestigious kabuki community to loss of his own father, and Bando saw it -- like his collaboration with Ma -- as fulfilling his destiny of kabuki actor, not a family tragedy.)", "Even though director Fichman sets it up as another divisive \"East vs. West\", \"Male vs. Woman\" piece of \"art\", soon we see the real show is in Bando translating Bach through his emotive movements that use gender as expression, not as a set biological fact. Meanwhile, Ma is suspended in his own intact world of cello-playing, ending his interaction with Bando (including eye contact!) at the development stage.", "This is fascinating for anyone interested in the creative process: Ma seizes on a set idea and doesn't let go; he even interprets Bando's \"performing for the heavens\" not as the idea of human-universe unity, but as the Greco-Roman concept of Dionysian. At that point Bando \"snaps\" back \"Don't think too much\", and we see artists retreating back to their individual corners, out of their initial love affair-through-interpreter!", "Bando truly is a fearless artist, unafraid to use what he already knows walking into unfamiliar territory of solo performance to someone else's emotional objectives. He comes up with a basic, technical pattern of movements for each piece in the 6-part suite, but goes above them to add the instinctive, emotional qualities of each theme. The most brilliant accomplishments of the 6 are the Bresson/Tarkovsky-like intensity of piece #4, \"Prayer\", and the amusing & lively #5 \"Dream\" -- which Dali & the Surrealists could learn from. Bando's \"Dream\" is neither a good one, nor a nightmare. It's just dreaming itself as rollicking, delicate motions like striking memories without control over the direction & speed of its consciousness. Brilliant stuff that pushes an art form beyond the usual level."]},

Ms. Khanjian's emotions weave their way through the movie, carrying the viewer as if they were on a flowing river. The story was beautifully told and the music of Yo-Yo Ma completes the story with passion, emotion and brilliance. The real surprise was the very downplayed role of Lori Singer as Dr. Angela France. She played her role with a subtle quality of mixing into the movie without using her presence to dominate the scene.

Most Christmas specials have messages about togetherness, family and giving. Sure, this one does, but at least it doesn't cram it down your throat like \"Frosty's Returns\".\nThe characters are interesting and likable. Bert Raccoon is a funny and lovable. The villain, Cyril Sneer, is a representation of corporate greed. Nothing says 1980's like corporate greed being abstracted in a cartoon. There are two things I would like to point out: The part where Ralph Raccoon (who akin to Melissa Raccoon, is the straight character/voice of reason), said to Bert, \"Let the sleeping dog lie\" is a laugh. Because it is reference to the old saying, \"Let sleeping dogs lie.\" Another scene, is where Cedric Sneer, Cyril's son, held up a skinny Christmas tree and talked about Christmas. This is a blatant reference to \"A Charlie Brown Christmas\" (read my review on this 1965 special). This Canadian cartoon referenced this American cartoon, 15 years later. If you want to spoof/reference/homage a childhood classic, you got to wait until you grow up. All in all, it is worth the watch, it is sweet, funny, and utterly charming.

And although it is not perfect and I do much prefer the 1965 and 1957 versions, I enjoyed this movie. For a TV movie it is well made and completely delightful to watch. The effects are above average, the costumes and sets are gorgeous and the ballroom sequence with its enchanting photography was the highlight of the film. The story is timeless, the choreography is dazzling and danced with gusto and while slightly corny at times the dialogue amuses. Rodgers and Hammerstein's songs are outstanding, with too many highlights to list. I wasn't so taken with the more contemporary numbers though, the style jarred with those of R&H's and other than to suit the voices of some of those involved I personally didn't see much point in adding them. Overall, the cast are just great, the multicultural issue didn't bother me at all. I wasn't a fan of Brandy as Cinderella, she's not terrible by all means, she's beautiful, charming and whimsical and interacts well with everyone, but there are times where she's made to look passive and this felt forced to me. Also I never quite warmed to her voice, the tuning and style are fine. It was more the tone, I've never liked singers who sound as though they are singing through their nose. However, the rest of the cast fare much better, Whitney Houston is a slightly overplayed but vocally outstanding Fairy Godmother, Bernadette Peters is a wonderfully wicked and somewhat tragic step-mother, Jason Alexander is hilarious as Lionel and as the prince Paolo Montalban is dashing. The stepsisters are suitably odious and Whoopi Goldberg seems to be enjoying herself as the Queen. Overall, credible version but not the best, that belongs to the 1957 version with Julie Andrews. 7/10 Bethany Cox"]},

Quite a few German movies produced by the Third Reich (and blatantly pro-Nazi with it) have entertaining storylines and good performances despite their dreadful political agenda. I've seen a few Soviet movies that succeed as artistic endeavours while promoting communist agitprop: a few, but very few. 'Clown Giorgi' is not one of those movies. It stinks, comrade.", "First, I'll give the Russians some credit. In Britain and in America, where Jonathan Winters calls people 'clown' as a term of abuse, we give very little respect to clowns ... and very few of our clowns deserve respect. (In America, clowns are one step above street mimes on the comedy food-chain.) In Russia, however, clowns are respected craftsmen ... and they deserve that respect. A typical clown in a Russian circus has spent years of apprenticeship in mastering acrobatics, juggling, animal-training and many demanding physical disciplines. (I've seen clowns in the Moscow State Circus who are truly astonishing.) In America, any jerk can be a clown with just some greasepaint and a dodgy wig.", "'Clown Giorgi' takes place in the Ukraine during Russia's civil war of 1918, and the propaganda is so thick you can cut it with a samovar. The communist Red Army are clearly depicted as the brave heroic good guys ... peace-loving commies who aren't afraid to die in battle, but who yearn for the war to end so they can go back to their agricultural collectives. The Menshevik forces of the White Army are the deceitful bloodthirsty oppressors. I would have put it just the other way round, but this movie asserts that 'Bolshevik' 'good'.", "The hero of this Russian film is a circus clown, so (by Russian standards of clowndom) audiences would perceive him as an admirable and resourceful figure, not a baggy-pants buffoon. In the opening scenes, we briefly see Giorgi doing his circus act. After the October uprising, he's conscripted into a Red Army brigade; he serves loyally but without distinction as the company clerk. The heavily-bearded brigade commander has been severely wounded in previous battles, but is still determined to fight onward. He needs a brave man to infiltrate the White Army's lines and learn their battle plans. Giorgi's experience as a clown makes him a master of disguise, so he volunteers for the mission. Giorgi succeeds, and gets back to the Red Army encampment just in time to see his bearded commander die selflessly and heroically. Someone must take this fallen hero's place to lead the Red brigade into battle ... but the soldiers will be demoralised if they learn that their commander has died.", "BLATANTLY OBVIOUS \"SURPRISE\" ENDING. Next thing we know, the bearded commander has risen from the dead ... and he courageously leads his valiant commie brethren into battle against the White Army. Just when the communists win the battle, their commander is shot dead. The corpse turns out to be wearing a false beard. Who can this be? Giorgi was a master of disguise, da? Eto pravda! The brave clown gave his life for the Communist Revolution.", "I have such utter contempt for communism (especially the Soviet variety) that I was tempted to hold my nose with one hand while I cranked this borscht through my Steenbeck viewer. It would take a very, very, VERY loyal Marxist-Leninist to enjoy this movie. I'll rate 'Clown Giorgi' one point out of 10. Bring back the czar!"]},

Soon its owner shows up demanding the story be pulled but minutes later that said Steamboat catches fire and hundreds are dead. The editor then gets chilling news but the story must go on. This two-reeler is like many early talkies in that it contains way too much dialogue. This film runs 21 -minutes but you'd think there was enough dialogue here for five feature films. Most of the dialogue doesn't contain much to the actual story being told but you can't help but think this film helped influence stuff like THE FRONT PAGE and countless other films where the editor or newspaper man are constantly talking fast and rushing around for the story. The film has a very strange mix of comedy and drama as the thing starts off with non-stop laugh attempts but then it grows extremely dark as the subject turns to hundreds of kids being burned alive. I was surprised to see how graphic some of the talk was but I do give the film credit for trying to tackle so much in such a short amount of time. Karns is pretty good in his role, although there's no question that he doesn't handle the drama as well as some might hope. Jack Carlyle, James Donlan and Tom McGuire add nice work to their roles as well. COPY certainly isn't a masterpiece but there's enough here for fans of early talkies to make it worth checking out."]},

A series that focused on what Clarke called \"mysteries of the first and second kind.\" That is, mysteries that no longer were in the modern world and phenomenon where evidence existed but interpretation was debated. In the series opening episode, Clarke noted a third kind of mysteries that included psychic phenomenon, ghosts, and cases where mind might literally be over matter. Five years after Mysterious World aired, Clarke took viewers through some of those mysteries across a World of Strange Powers.", "Clarke, introduced at the start of every episode as \"the author of 2010 and inventor of the communications satellite,\" was an ideal choice to act as frontman of the series, appearing around his adopted home on the island of Sri Lanka. As a writer of science fact and fiction, Clarke had addressed many of the topics discussed in the series, including in his novel Childhood's End whose climax was set in motion by an entire generation developing psychic and telekinetic abilities. And, as a self-confessed lover of mysteries used to appearing in programs such as The Sky at Night and news coverage of the Apollo moon landings, he was what we'd term today a \"media personality.\"", "Like with Mysterious World, Clarke's presence as front man set a very different tone for the series compared to contemporary series such as the Leonard Nimoy hosted In Search Of..., for example. World of Strange Powers keeps well away from making any sensationalistic claims, with witnesses to the extraordinary given a chance to describe what happened before experts look over the available evidence. The series seventh episode, looking at extraordinary photographs of fairies and ghosts, is a prime example of this approach, including its coverage of the famous Cottingley Fairies. Science, not magic, rules the day with the Clarke and the series as a whole, with newscaster Anna Ford offering narration between Clarke's segments.", "Photographs are just the tip of the iceberg. Firewalking, the power of hexes, stigmata, and premonitions are just a handful of the topics that the series covers as the series takes viewers around the world. All building up to the series finale, where Clarke takes the opportunity to go through the dozen previous episodes and rank the possibility of each topic. To risk invoking modern internet clickbait, Clarke's stances may well surprise viewers, even if he retains some skepticism on some of the topics.", "Yet despite how well the series was made and how well it holds up, it's less satisfying than its predecessor. Something owed, perhaps, to the topics being covered. After all, as Clarke notes at one point, you can prove something happens, you can never prove that it doesn't. Given the series focus on intangible mysteries, definitive answers remain just out of reach.", "Even so, Strange Powers remains as watchable even now. From Clarke as frontman to its reserved tone, it remains head and shoulders above many similar series. And for a series approaching forty, that's by no means a bad thing."]},

Amusingly, though they are shown to be competitors, they are working in the same room. Everybody seems to think that Dr. Felix (Carlo Wieth) is the man for the job. His research is far more advanced than that of Dr. Voluntas (Gunnar Tolnaess). But deep down, things aren't so sunshiny for Dr. Felix. He is a lonely man, in love with Margaret (Johanne Fritz-Petersen). So Felix confides to Voluntas, who promises he will have the woman he craves for, if Felix does everything Voluntas tells him. This leads you expect a darker narrative than what we are in for, since Voluntas begins by taking his buddy to beauty parlor, and giving him a make-over. Oh, the horror...", "The general idea is, that now that the great scientist is chasing a lady, he ignores his work, and Voluntas gets the advantage. Many early horror tales resembled this one. The righteous man straying from the good path, evil thus triumphing. It's not terribly unlike \"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\", though that is a better narrative. The lesson of the film seems to be, \"be happy with your lot\". That is not very nice, since certainly we should all have time to pursue both scientific achievements and pretty ladies. The dualism of the film, the easy divide to good and bad, really lessens the psychological merit of the narrative. Also, the film initially tells you that the doctors are trying to create an important tonic, and only in the end is it mentioned, that the tonic is the cure for cancer. This turns the narrative around for the audience (though not for the characters), since this is too important a subject to be tackled in such a half-assed manner.", "So in the end, this movie has little horror and much moralizing. The cinematic merit is not anything out of the ordinary, since by 1915 D.W. Griffith, Victor Sjöström and Yevgeni Bauer (just to name a few) were all telling narratives more coherent and better executed. For hard-core fans of silent cinema, this might be an interesting curiosity, but you can certainly find better silent horror-dramas."]},

That late '70s-proposed project went through several screenplay drafts until it landed in \"development hell.\" Zanuck and Brown's next attempt to get the film off the ground in the early '90s came by the way of Steven Spielberg. However, Spielberg has his own asteroid movie in the works when he bought the rights to Arthur C. Clarke's novel, The Hammer of God (1993) -- which itself reminds of Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle's award-winning novel, Lucifer's Hammer (1977), itself a post-apocalypse tale concerned with a rogue comet striking Earth. As result: both projects were combined as one film.", "Sadly, that theatrical version of Clarke's work -- set in the year 2109, replete with rich characters, layered plot, political intrigue, and religious zealotry (the asteroid's arrival mixed with warmongering spawned a new world religion) -- was lost amid a series of rewrites that left us with a run-of-the-mill, present-day asteroid flick known as Deep Impact (1998). Then Disney's Touchstone Pictures developed their counter-programming Armageddon (1998) -- complete with Liv Tyler's perpetual-weeping eyes.", "That backstory on Deep Impact brings us to this Roger Corman's New Horizon's Pictures-backed production originally known as The Cusp. Produced by Starfield Independent Studios for TMN-The Movie Network, a Canadian premium television network, they spent a mere $2 million -- against the $80 million for Deep Impact. The Cusp was the first of four sci-fi/space films by the joint venture. The others were Future Fear (1997; with Jeff Wincott) and Shepherd (1998; C. Thomas Howell and Roddy Piper), and Cybermaster (1999; aka Shepherd II, starring C. Thomas Howell and Heidi von Palleske, who also stars, here). Now, I haven't watched the other three films, but rest assure: there's prop and set recycling afoot. Plus, reading the synopsis on each: they share subplots of religious cults fighting against technology.", "In the end: the closest you'll get to a theatrical version of the plot-complex The Hammer of God is The Cusp, which -- in a shorter, 80-minute joint US video and cable television release -- is known as the more common sense title of Falling Fire.", "Set in the year 2051, the ISA (The International Space Agency) sends mining vessels to retrieve asteroids by using a series of detonations to guide them into Earth orbit for mineral stripping. Does it harm the environment? Maybe. But it creates millions of jobs in the process.", "During the mission of the Spirit of 49's retrieval of MT-27, the crew begins to experience a series of questionable accidents; a double-agent from the \"Children of Gaia,\" a religious-cum-environmental terrorist organization, is on board. Her orders, which include seducing Micheal Pare (in a sub-zero gravity sex scene one-upping the lame \"Dance the Night Away\" scene in 2000's Mission to Mars), is sending the asteroid -- and the vessel with its nuke armaments -- into the Earth as a form of \"spiritual cleansing.\"", "See, this sound a hell of lot better than putting up with two hours of Tea Leoni's and Elijah Wood's relationship drivel as Morgan Freeman croaks about an \"Ark in the mountains\" before the inevitable, happens.", "Yeah, The Cusp takes a while to get going, but once it gets over the first-act set-up hump, a great story is discovered. The script offers interesting layers and where-is-this-going plot twists, and, most importantly: the relationship subplot between Pare's space-bound Daryl Boden and Heidi von Pallaeske as Pare's Earth-bound CIA agent-wife battling the religious terrorists (that have depth and aren't just slobbering maniacs) on Earth, doesn't derail the action.", "What does derail one's watch: the poor CGI spaceship exteriors and asteroid, which, almost, made me turn off the movie. However, the wide-shot (the wider, the better in this case) space and asteroid walk scenes, and the related space suits, are as good any major studio sci-fi film. In addition, the Tubi upload was a grainy, VHS-emulsion scratched copy that's slightly fuzzy, throughout. Not every film can have a 4K digital restore, so beware.", "All in all, this wasn't a bad Tubi discovery. As long as one goes in not comparing it to its Hollywood inspirations -- and, most importantly, watch the longer, easier-to-follow Canadian-cut under The Cusp, and not the shorter, Corman-cut known as Falling Fire -- you'll be entertained."]},

Charlotte secures the detective inside the closet by placing a folding director's chair beneath the doorknob. Not only is the chair barely sturdy enough for sitting in, it's about five inches below the doorknob. But since this is a Stephen Apostolof (a.k.a. A.C. Stephen) movie, the detective is trapped long enough for our crooks to hop on a plane and escape to the Matterhorn Ski Resort, where \"rock star\" Diamond Jim is performing. Diamond Jim is called such because he sings while draped in REAL diamonds (he's also what a \"Benny & Joon\" sequel might look like starring Eric Balfour, but that's beside the point). Victor and Charlotte get wind of the real diamonds—a detail that Diamond Jim's manager is only too happy to share with anyone within earshot—and they know they have to get their hands on that \"ice.\" Though the thieving couple could just drill through the door of the resort's plywood safe, Victor and Charlotte instead hatch a plan that involves sending the resort's manager (Apostolof stock player Forman Shane, billed as Harvey Shain here) on a false errand and Victor seducing the manager's wife, who will have sex with any man except her husband. Hilarity ensues.", "Well, it's supposed to. None of director Apostolof's movies have a reputation for being any good, but they are known for having lots of T&A. So what \"Hot Ice\" lacks in laughs should be more than compensated with lots of nudity and simulated sex, right? As much as that would help, no. Despite having plenty of sexual situations, most involving the manager's wife Danielle (Teresa Parker, who should have been told those facial expressions were neither sexy nor cute), as well as some shapely '70s babes (Mariwin Roberts, Linda Gildersleeve) and popular adult performers (Rick Cassidy, Ric Lutze) in the cast, \"Hot Ice\" is meant to be an R-rated comedy. In lieu of simulated humping we get Forman Shane chewing scenery like a third rate Harvey Korman and lots of ski footage re-purposed from Apostolof's \"The Snow Bunnies.\" During the movie's few sex scenes Apostolof goes out of his way not to expose too much flesh, usually by zooming in on the dude's back, though he does throw in a scene of spontaneous topless dancing at a cocktail lounge (\"Go ahead—take it off!\"), a genuinely funny moment, if only because it's so ridiculous.", "Ed Wood, Jr. was a frequent collaborator with Apostolof, co-writing scripts for \"Fugitive Girls\" and \"Drop Out Wife\" among others, but Wood is credited only as an assistant director for \"Hot Ice.\" Despite some scenes that suggest otherwise, Apostolof said Wood had no hand in writing the script for this movie. Though Apostolof proves he's just as capable of writing a bad script on his own, Wood's input might have made \"Hot Ice\" a special brand of terrible."]},

I'm not a big fan of gritty realism, but this movie was extremely intelligent and sensetive in its handling of potentially ugly people and a potentially vulgar, trashy scenario/storyline: that alone sets it apart from about ninety percent of the \"gay\" cinema that I have seen. Taylor handles his subjects well, and while this is no groundbreaking work of film, it is consistently and appropriately crafted throughout. Points to the women of the film for turning in excellent performances all around, and to Ed Corbin for the way he deftly handled the moment he asks Oliver if he can just hold him: it was totally believable, and you could see everything this guy had to go through to make such a request. Also, a fantastic, beautiful, haunting soundtrack that I really wish I could find on CD. All in all, a worthy effort, worth checking out."]},

Was there a toy line for this film? I can't imagine parents buying their children characters like D'compose, a rotting corpse with an exposed rib cage and snakes head who turns people into zombies with a touch of his finger. Anyway, the basic plot follows Earthcore as they battle against 3 giant underworld creatures that the film is named after. Helping Earthcore are talking trees and rock men and a magnetic creature that's actually two in one. The animation is cheap even by the standards of the day. For example, one of Blackthornes' goons suddenly becoming two when Mary drives off in her car. One thing I did enjoy though was the use of split-screen during some of the fight sequences; shame there wasn't more of it. Oh, and one of the Earthcore members being named 'the Liquidator', which amused me for no apparent reason."]},

Lowball is not in the same league as Graceland in terms of budget, but it is definetly a better movie than the aforementioned Graceland.

With his partner in tow (Erik Schrody), John is shaking down low life mobsters and gangsters in hopes that someone knows the guy who's got his sister and get back in one piece in 24 hours. Greene is particularly excellent playing a good, but not all good cop and Schrody is very good as well trying not to make himself look like a fool in this film. While it does have some good cinematography, the film is otherwise mirky and full of shadows. I guess it's the budget, if it had a bigger budget this film would be a 110 times better.

I like Millie Swickle, Claude Raintree, and the guy who plays Millie's father. It's all so cute and funny or ridiculous, you'll laugh yourself right out of your seat and swear you've been beat up by stupid. There's this hilariously long chase seen, where you get the feeling the director got out the weirdest music he was glad he never through away and decided he had to roll a lot of film to make the movie longer. Also there's all this play going on about Claude Raintree, our legendary hero, and Millie Swickle, his love interest. It's cute. As crazy as this movie is with orphans traveling in the back of a sort of dump truck, a horrible minstrel performance by a deputy and police chasing remote control vehicles all to the tune of psychedelic music, it's a delightful campfire tale type sort of story and filming. It makes you laugh cause it's so incredibly stupid. It's the most fantastic film ever made. I wish I could see it at least six more times."]},

In both plays the main characters are named Charles and Peter. They are not the same individuals, although both characters named Charles are schoolteachers, both Peters are married to a woman named Hilary, and in both plays we learn that Charles and Peter were at public school together. In \"Two Sundays\" the character named Charles is played by Alan Bates and the one named Peter by Dinsdale Landen; in \"Plaintiffs and Defendants\" it's the other way around. In each play the character played by Alan Bates has a son named Jeremy. Simon Cadell, Rosemary Martin and Georgina Hale all appear in both plays.", "In \"Plaintiffs and Defendants\", Peter is a barrister specialising in divorce cases. His current client, Mrs Sawsbury, is suing her ex-husband for custody of their children, although the play is as much about Peter's private life as it is about his work. He is married to a university lecturer named Hilary, but is caught up in an affair with a demanding mistress named Joanna. Although Hilary has not yet discovered the truth about her rival, it seems only a matter of time before she does. Peter is not in love with Joanna- quite the opposite- but is unable to give her up, partly because he knows she is infatuated with him and would not hesitate to inform Hilary in an attempt to bring matters to a head.", "In \"Two Sundays\" the two main characters were roughly of equal importance, whereas in \"Plaintiffs and Defendants\" it is Peter who is the more important and Charles who effectively acts as his Father Confessor. He confesses to Charles not only his affair with Joanna but also all the vices- smoking, drinking, eating meat- which he wishes he could give up but finds himself unable to. (Charles, who is teetotal, non-smoking and vegetarian, seems happily married to his wife Rosemary). Although Hilary does not know about Joanna, she realises that something has gone out of their marriage, and has only a future of \"Sunday lunches and monthly dinners\" to happen to \"until something happens to change them, a death probably\".", "The main theme of \"Two Sundays\" is the common one of the way in which youthful innocence gives way to middle-aged experience. Youthful innocence plays less of a role in \"Plaintiffs and Defendants\", which is more about the way in which middle-aged experience gives way to an acceptance of the inevitability of death. If the best performance in \"Two Sundays\" came from Landen as the cynical, disillusioned Peter, here it comes from Bates as another cynical, disillusioned character named Peter.", "I would rank \"Two Sundays\" as the better of the two plays, largely because \"Plaintiffs and Defendants\" . Suffers, in my view, from a rather abrupt ending involving the death of a minor character with little connection to what has gone before. Nevertheless, both plays struck me as examples of the way in which British television in the seventies was able to produce intelligent, thoughtful drama (and not only as part of the \"Play for Today\" series), something increasingly rare in the more sensationalist television industry of today. 7/10."]},

Back home the family palace has been converted into a military hospital where Else is serving as a nurse.", "There is a traitor in the home camp who crosses the no man's land dividing the two armies to betray details of the all-important battery which he then proceeds to sabotage. A lovesick Alexis decides to dispatch a carrier pigeon with a message to Else warning her of the treachery. She sets off at once for the front to warn her father and brother. The battery blows up but Erik arrives in time to protect his father from the results but the traitor escapes in the confusion. The enemy offensive is then comprehensively defeated and all their retrenchments captured....", "....except the one commanded by Alexis, against which Erik is now sent. He and Alexis do literally come face to face in the ensuing fight and he tells his sister, now a nurse in the front line, after the victory that he believes her lover to be dead. They search together for him among the prisoners of war and among the dead and dying on the battlefield...", "The rump of the enemy army, the despised and now repentant traitor along with them, has retreated to a mountain bunker where it intends to resist to the last man but Erik has a plan for taking the fortress and, at great personal risk, scrambles across the no man's land to effect his plan....", "So the finale, which I shall not reveal, concerns a women and three men - Else (whose loyalties are torn between her family and the man she loves), the honourable enemy Alexis (dead or alive?), the traitor (will he redeem himself?) and the hero Erik (will his plan succeed). The ending (for the US market?) is grotesquely happy (which I suppose rather answers all those questions) and one rather hopes that they shot a darker alternative for the Russian market (which they were in the habit of doing). It is a film, from a detached Danish neutral perspective, without ideological or propaganda content that, despite its title, is more about good old-fashioned personal honour than it is about patriotism.", "It is not a particularly inspiring story but Blom directs with his customary skill and the location shooting by Johan Ankestjerne is excellent. Neither had any lessons to learn from D. W. Griffith or Billy Bitzer. Indeed the film looks strikingly \"modern\" by comparison with The Birth of the Nation which came out at almost exactly the same time. Much more natural in its acting style and mise en scène and without any of the rather old-fashioned tableau effects, \"facial\" close-ups that Griffith and Bitzer chose to use.", "The title (a very common one in these years) comes of course from the famous Horace tag famously described by British poet Wilfred Owen as \"the \"old lie\" Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori. Denmark was in an embarrassing and complicated position during the Great War. With significant economic ties both to Britain and Germany, it did its best to stay neutral but was in practice led by purely geopolitical and economic considerations to favour Germany, agreeing to mine the Baltic Sea on their behalf. Later in the war, an Anglo-American blockade of Denmark would cause severe economic difficulties and an increasing reliance on German imports.", "So the nation of \"patriotism\" did not really have quite the same ring for Danes as it did for the more ideologically committed combattants. The war for Denmark was quite simply a nuisance, an embarrassment and and an economic disaster while the country also had a strong pacifist tradition. So this film has none of the propagandist tone that became increasingly marked in British, French and Italian films and reached hysterical proportions in the US Kaiser-bashing films of 1918.", "The war shown here is therefore very much s traditional and rather gentlemanly affair (the caddish traitor apart) which shows no awareness of the traumatic realities that the combattant nations were experiencing and which would only really begin to become common knowledge from 1916 onwards. It is, if you like, the war that Europeans thought they weer going to fight in 1914 not the ghastly murderous imbroglio they in fact found themselves immersed in.", "In this respect the US had more relevant experience. The American Civil War had very much pointed the way for the horrors to come and the US was, prior to 1914, the only country to have really experienced the reality of modern warfare; the European experience was limited to the one-sided slaughter of colonial warfare. So the scenes of battle in The Birth of the Nation should in a sense have been more realistic except that Griffith and Bitzer follow Ince, the expert in the field, in presenting rather a glamourised picture of trench-warfare. The war-scenes in Blom's film, filmed in part in a sort of matte-shot slide-show (a technique not by any means invented by Bitzer), illustrate both the dominance of heavy artillery and the carnage that followed any offensive but remain more \"charge of the light brigade\" than \"battle of the Somme\". The battle-scenes in neither film much resemble representations of warfare that become common in films after 1916-17 (following the release of British and German documentaries about the Battle of the Somme)."]},

Interestingly, the credits contain the names of some of the actors in the frame story as well as actors CUT from the frame story! And the actors in the main story, including well-known William Farnum, are NOT listed in the credits. There's not much sleaze here if that's what you are looking for--this is even tamer than the sound version of ROAD TO RUIN. The credit for photographer Frank Zukor (aka Zucker) leads me to believe that the frame story may have been a NYC-based Bud Pollard production (Pollard is best-known today for his 1940's Black-cast films and for being president of the Screen Directors' Guild). Zukor shot Pollard's VICTIM OF PERSECUTION and some Yiddish-language features. Perhaps some Yiddish film scholar can enlighten us about the origin of this film. There's undoubtedly an interesting story behind this strange patchwork feature( While we're discussing exploitation films, I believe SEX MADNESS was also made by people who otherwise made Yiddish films). However, this film will be of interest ONLY to the serious student of exploitation films or odd patchwork features such as, say, GUN CARGO or CALL OF THE ROCKIES."]},

Today I saw the film at the Jacob Burns Film Center in Pleasantville, NY, a remarkably fine art house for a place not in New York City.", "\nIn the restored version, travelers, all men,  meet at a tavern and in the time honored tradition reminiscent of Chaucer they begin to tell stories. Imbibing moderately but with gusto they hear one of their companions relate a story about how the prophet Elijah,important in Jewish lore, engineered a happy ending to a convoluted tale of love almost lost in Vilna.", "As the narrator unfolds his story, the silent film begins (with subtitles or we'd all be lost).

The smarmy businessman, resembling many stereotypes of avaricious Jews,  takes the house from the mother and subsequently finds the jewelry which he decides - big surprise - to keep.", "The plot gets complicated but in the end all is well thanks to the intervention of a Christ-like Elijah who effortlessly assumes myriad identities as he does the Lord's (I guess) work.  The scenes in which Elijah is in various guises seems to copy early silent film characterizations of Christ with the closeups reflecting unearthly expressions of divine grace.", "What is truly fascinating about \"A Vilna Legend\" is its depiction of the city's vanished Jewish community.  Scenes from the Talmud school recapture a time in which the ultra-Orthodox males did nothing but study while others provided their subsistence.  But there is licentiousness and plain stupidity amongst the school's minions.  Rather than painting what we see in \"Fiddler on the Roof\" as a usually happy and always mutually supportive community, this film acknowledges the wide range of behavior at all levels of society including the school devoted to holy writ.  I thought of the novels of Isaac Bashevis Singer where he relentlessly strips human passions to the bone.", "The 1933 incorporation of most of the silent film into a wider picture reflects very smart, effective movie-making.

By the way, to the best of my knowledge this is absolutely the first film in which, unmistakably, a bagel appears.", "Of course the Jews lost their secular and religious communities in Eastern Europe but \"A Vilna Legend\" proves that the world also suffered a cultural loss with the genocidal extinction of a vibrant albeit strange community.", "A significant film worth seeking out.", "8/10."]},

Pradeep kumar, who is often seen in historical characters, gives justice to his character, though nothing extraordinary in his performance. But I appreciate his chemistry with Madhubala. Kammo has done a great job while being a great support to Madhubala, especially in the comedy scenes. Ulhas portrayed the negativity in his character so well.

Madhubala 's character is a well written character.", "The sets of the film are spectacular. There is pretty good cinematography. Some stunning tracking shots and dolly shots can be seen in the film.

He also discovers an antidote to the medicine that brings about these changes. While in the Hyde form he commits all manner of horrible outrages so that the whole city of London rings with the news thereof. Dr. Jekyll, while in his natural form, that of a cultured, charming young man, is horror-stricken by the brutalities which he commits in the other form. Ere long the medicine at last begins to have an extraordinary effect, the changes taking place without the volition of Jekyll. In order to protect himself from being seen by any one in his beastly form, he locks himself in his room, when he feels the change about to take place, and with the aid of an old servant sends for the antidote to bring him back to his original form. He is engaged to a charming young lady, Maud, who is terribly grieved at his extraordinary conduct in the way of disappearance. Whilst in the form of Jekyll, he goes to his solicitor and makes arrangements that Hyde shall be his heir, so soon as the transformation again takes place he presents himself in his Hyde form to his solicitor. He is guilty of terrible outrages, becomes a fugitive from justice after which he is caught and attempts to make peace by the giving of a large check. Unfortunately the signature is not that of Hyde but of Jekyll. Whilst in his Jekyll form his fiancée and friends are horrified by seeing him change before their eyes into the murderer Hyde. The last scene shows Dr. Jekyll struggling with a nightmare in his chair and awakening in the presence of Maud, thank God it was all a dream."]},

One charming aspect regards those subtitles is that the style of script changes from standard type to Gothic when scripture is being quoted.

This film is one of them. Jewish producers were preeminent in the interwar Polish film industry but, due to the pervasive antisemitism of the early '20s, they shied away from films dealing with Jewish themes. It was not until 1924 that amateurs, Henryk Bojm and Leo Forbert, adapted a Peretz Hirshbein play for the screen. Ambitiously mounted, professionally cast, it was one of the most successful Jewish cinematic efforts undertaken up to that time. In 1933, a group of New York Yiddish actors decided to give the original 1924 gem a new lease on life. They added a narration and several new scenes (those in the tavern) which gave dramatic justification to the narrative form. A precursor to the 1937 classic, The Dybbuk, A Vilna Legend features the same classic tale of frustrated love and destiny and the breaking/fulfillment of vows. A yeshiva student and an orphan girl who are deeply in love face eternal separation even though their parents promised them to each other before birth. Only the prophet Elijah's miraculous intervention allows their parents to fulfill their vow and the couple their love."]},

A reporter is after a big story and interviews June in jail, following her being kidnapped and made into a spy, not La Femme Nikita, but a creative plot ploy nonetheless.", "We are talked through a story of corruption, evil guys (Leslie and actor/director Costello himself) plus shady women, notably divine and dreamy Sharon Mitchell as Helga and Ursula Austin as Inga.", "The twists and turns are dumb but the hour-long opus unfolds with zero flab and no longueurs, quite an achievement.

Like much of Costello's work and that of many of his contemporaries, the film is cock-centric. By that I mean that it was generally considered back in the day that the erect dick is the most cinematic image in explicit porn, other considerations like cunnilingus, lesbian sex or even the flaccid members of the likes of say a John Holmes or Bill Margold, playing second fiddle. As a result, looming closeups of members being sucked, thrusting in and out, or ejaculating eat up an inordinate amount of running time.", "This is evident to even the casual observer of porn, but in a movie like JUNE the constant in-your-face extreme close-ups of Costello's or his co-stars' cocks seems nearly fetishistic. (Note that soft-core sex cinema was and is obsessed with naked and large breasts, and not just because Hugh Hefner and Russ Meyer promoted them.)", "The porn playing field has been leveled to some extent, especially with the considerable popularity in recent years of lesbian videos. But the current obsession with interracial features - big black dick/little white chick combos that Jake Steed only dreamed of 15 years back, indicates that the worship of Priapus on screen has emerged once again, big time."]},

While \"churning out\" pretty much describes the filmmaker's approach towards the explicit throughout most of the '80s, his XXX offerings from the previous decade still bear the traces of a master craftsman valiantly attempting to elevate a both then as now disregarded genre above its lowly station. He would achieve this through the very elements that made his sexploitation flicks stand out from the crowd, i.e. involved story lines, psychologically sound characterizations and surprisingly decent acting. Anyone who has ever watched one of Sarno's suggestive tease flicks, amongst which I would like to proffer 1968's ALL THE SINS OF SODOM as a very good place to start exploring a rather massive body of work, should be well aware that he was also second to none when it came to creating a palpably erotic atmosphere where every glance and gesture would draw the audience deeper into tantalizing turmoil.", "One of the truly amazing things about THE TROUBLE WITH YOUNG STUFF remains that it was one of at least four films Sarno shot almost simultaneously back in 1976, along with the equally excellent SLIPPERY WHEN WET and the far more obscure HOT WIVES and THE HONEY CUP, all of them made in and around the same locations with minor cast variations. This fact really serves as a tribute to the talented \"cinéaste\" whose output would eventually grow so large and unwieldy that by life's end he had no idea how many movies he might have made, a conundrum duly shared by the rest of the world in light of the vast number of aliases he had employed, some still unconfirmed to this day. Unlike some of the other creatives of carnality, Sarno knew exactly what he could achieve given the time and budget at his disposal and how to tailor his narratives to bring out the best of his financial and artistic resources. Often working with the same handful of dramatically gifted New York performers meant he could write parts bearing them in mind and capitalize on any specific forte they might possess.", "Another aspect routinely skipped over in other people's adult efforts is the presence of an economic reality as opposed to the anything goes fantasy fulfillment environment most porn appears to take place in. For instance, here it's a rundown small town somewhere in the South and most of the characters have been unemployed ever since the local textile mill was forced to close down, not exactly a setting conducive to carnality at first glance. But Sarno uses this bleak situation, undoubtedly recognizable to much of the day's audience, to reinforce the morals and motivations that drive his \"dramatis personae\" and therefore imbue them with a life and urgency that's uncommon to say the least in the fornication film field.", "Longtime friends Alice Ann and Rose (Crystal Sync and Marlene Willoughby respectively) share an apartment with their blue collar boyfriends Roger Caine and Bob Bolla, both of whom are still employed if only just, largely out of financial necessity as these living arrangements put obvious strain on both couples. Their slutty sidekick Dinah (quite possibly Nancy Dare's career performance) further exacerbates this increasingly untenable situation by bringing over her occasional boyfriends such as milkman Sonny Landham as her strict mom (Gloria Leonard) won't allow her to entertain at home. About to make matters much worse, although her transgressive behavior indicates the possibility of an eventual much-needed catharsis for several of the plot's protagonists, is Alice Ann's two minutes past jail bait cousin Matilda (Jenny Baxter) who was \"sent away\" for being an unmanageable teen and now seems to have some kind of retaliation on her mind. Adult cinema theorists (should such a beast exist !) can chalk this up as another variation on Sarno's favorite theme of the intimate interloper wreaking havoc within the \"family\" unit by seducing each member thereof, as in DADDY DARLING, BABY LOVE or LAURA'S TOYS to name but a few of the more obvious examples.", "Scored with appropriately sombre guitar strumming by Jack Justis, the narrative delves much deeper into people's psyches than adult is wont to do without sacrificing the sex which Sarno manages to incorporate into the film's fabric as both an intrinsic and invaluable element. The exceptional cast, comprised of just eight people, rises beautifully to the occasion with the women especially standing out. The mischievous Baxter, who worked in the porn industry to pay for college tuition, makes the most of a meaty part as the proverbial fly in the ointment but it's the usually campy Marlene Willoughby who ultimately impresses most of all. Dowdied down from her familiar larger than life persona and stripped of its attendant mannerisms, she really comes into her own as the apparently resilient Italian American Rose whose sexual, emotional and eventually even moral victimization at the hands of the scheming Matilda proves particularly jarring. Although the come-on implied by the film's title isn't complete hogwash in light of the climactic revelations that are arrived at in a scene between the estranged cousins, it has always crippled a movie that deserved a much better fate and reputation than it has been wrongfully saddled with over the years."]},

The contract is so the Baron can retain control over Eddie. Eddie is given the code name Franz Grauman, and all electronic correspondence he is to end with \"XXX\" as a sign that he is all right.

This triple cross becomes an issue for all sides as Eddie tries to maneuver his way through what could be potentially enemy territory in France and Germany if the Germans ever found out his allegiance to the British. His possible downfalls include trying to remember what he should and should not know as he talks to both sides, and his weakness for the opposite sex, most specifically a Frenchwoman named Paulette who he met at a transit camp in France and who has ties to the French resistance, and the Countess Helga Lindstrom, a Swede working for the Nazis.", "Fictionalized account of Eddie Chapman and his exploits during World War II.

Currently Kevin Spacey & Nic Cage both hit me the same way, but fortunately neither of them does sex films (Allah be praised!).", "The rest of the cast goes along with Marc's antics but there's no saving this mess. The only one I enjoyed was Shelley Duvall-resembling Judy Craven as the farmer's wife, who actually gets an interesting talkative routine going. Sadly, all three women in the cast are not very attractive, and the sex is unerotic throughout. Shaun even throws in a closeup of kidnapper Ashley Moore relieving himself for bad measure.", "Soundtrack is definitely insulting, trying to sound corn pone in order to match the \"sticks\" locale of the \"story\".

This party is an excuse to trot out a motley crew of porn celebrities in cameo appearances including Fred J. Lincoln, Sharon Kane, Veronica Hart dressed as a caped superhero, Ashlyn Gere and even someone who I could swear was Serena (though I must be wrong, she having left the biz years earlier).", "I especially liked Nikki's sexual performance including her anal specialty number, though her pained overacting as Dough's victim won't win any SAG award even in the parallel porn universe. Dough's smug, one-note thesping, bad, bad, all-bad guy, is poor, especially in light of the many interesting characterizations he's contributed over the years. It's fun to see Lisa Ann pretending to be the innocent 19-year-old heroine, most notably in a ridiculous scene where Dough has her act out, blow job and all, her memory of being abused.

The rapes usually take place in their parents' home, with Findlay voicing over personally mama's \"what's going on in there?\" reaction outside the bedroom.", "But Findlay's strategy is upfront (if missed by the casual viewer, like the previous poster's non-review in IMDb): she has cast very obviously too-old actresses in the lead roles (pushing 30 rather than 16). Notably Marlene Willoughby, who could just as well, and more convincingly, have been cast as the mother of one of the gals. In most of these '70s exercises, nubile young talent that looks convincingly underage (e.g., Tawny Pearl, Nancy Hoffman or Amber Hunt) is employed to pander to the dirty-old-man viewer's fantasies.", "In addition, she ends up mocking and abusing Nichols, with the girls in the final reels turning the tables on him. They comically wear out his penis, and Willoughby violates him anally with a dildo for good measure. Though Findlay liked to sign her films with a male moniker (using \"Walter A.

The girl's sexual servicing of Cook in the screening room saves the day.", "Film is well-made and at times well-acted enough to approximate a real movie.

Under the tutelage of \"house girls\" Sandi Pinney, dusky diva Desiree West and the tragic Kristine Heller, she learns to fulfill the fantasies of the lonely regulars like frustrated school principal \"Radio\" Ray Wells and mother-fixated weirdo John Seeman who frequent the place...until her husband's business partner Paul Thomas inadvertently turns up looking for action.

", "An effortlessly intriguing and intelligent script is handled with commendable delicacy by Graver, who was of course also responsible for the first rate cinematography. Sex scenes are invariably raw and intense with the usually ladylike Haven really letting her hair down for a welcome change, especially in the memorable marital rape sequence with Leslie. Kay Parker makes her non-sex debut as the maternal madam and, ironically, looks older than she did in subsequent features. Extremely interesting eclectic soundtrack borrows from real world sources far and wide, including several tracks (amongst which his popular \"Psyché Rock\") by French avant-garde/\"musique concrète\" deity Pierre Henry, already employed by this director to spectacular effect in his fabulous fornication film-making debut 3 AM."]},

CJ Laing is their guru, and she leads the women in various dances in diaphanous robes while purloined sitar music plays. Eventually, the two guys get tired of watching and join in, with the women all too happy to incorporate them into their rituals.", "Joe Sarno is listed as the director (I'm not sure based on what - the available version doesn't have any credits), but I have my doubts, as the film doesn't really match his style. It's certainly not somber like his B&W '60s melodramas, nor does it approach anything like the wacky schtick of A TOUCH OF GENIE, his best erotic comedy. Instead, it seems more like the type of silliness Shaun Costello and Ron Dorfman were cranking out in the mid-'70s, with a goofy, threadbare plot invariably leading to one major location and - in addition to all the fornicating - a lot of vamping and camping from the cast. This loopy quality only worsens as the film moves along, with the cult eventually sucking in (literally) a male cop (Levi Richards) looking for the criminals and consistently cross-cutting to the couple downstairs, who turn out to be the owners of the place that was robbed (off-camera) at the outset. The conclusion is an erratic chase around the apartment building, seemingly accomplished on a single floor just by changing the paper sign next to the elevator, as the Marlow and Love ride up and down, madly fornicating. It's certainly broad, but is it entertaining?", "The answer is not terribly. While no more or less watchable than any other mid-level one-day wonder, the film is just coherent and competent enough to be tolerable, while nevertheless bogging down in extended sex scenes that test the audience's patience. Your mileage will vary depending on your like (or dislike) for certain performers, but to me, despite the hints of creativity, the overall result merely comes in this side of average. No matter who's responsible, I doubt it represents a career high-point."]},

Driven by the essence of warm, bright-red blood and the power of unseen dark forces, the evil temptress forces her luscious female followers to give in to their most intimate sexual impulses, to preserve her unholy spirit. But in this hellish purgatory of perversion and blood, the accursed black sisterhood is unaware that the raven-haired leader of sin has an ulterior motive: to reincarnate in the fresh body of one of her satanic disciples.", "Nestled in the mountains of Germany, a grim and secluded castle stands - the haunted legacy of the beautiful medieval vampire Baroness Varga. Put to death for her ravenous hunger for female blood, the Baroness uttered a curse that she would one day return to forever satisfy her unnatural lust...and that day has finally come. Four women have gathered at the castle unaware that its darkly seductive housekeeper is a satanic high priestess presiding over a coven of delectable servants who each night perform sensual rituals and profane acts to keep the Baroness' spirit alive. As the women are drawn deeper into the ultra erotic nightmare, it will be the most uninhibited among them who shall serve as the vessel into which the Baroness passes...to continue her unholy reign of terror.", "Two young women, Helga Borich [Marie Forså] and Monika Tarnek [Ulrike Butz], one or both of whom\nmay be a direct descendent of Baroness Dania Varga who was burned as a\nvampire and witch in the 17th century, have arrived at Castle Varga. They\nare met by the housekeeper, Fraulein Wanda Krock [Nadia Henkowa], and several of her\nstaff, all of whom are dressed in long, matronly, black dresses.\nAfter getting settled in their rooms, Helga, Monika, and Monika's\ngirlfriend are taken to see a portrait of the Baroness, who is a\ndead-ringer for Monika. As a storm brews outside, two travelers -- Dr\nJulia Malenko [Anke Syring], an anthropologist studying the local superstitions, and her\nbrother Peter [Nico Wolf] -- knock on the castle door. They are having car trouble and\nneed shelter for the night. During the night, the guests are awakened by\nthe sound of chanting and bongo drums, which seems to bring out the libido\nin everyone within earshot. Julia begins to suspect that something is\nwrong and makes her brother wear a cross made out of garlic cloves. Julia\nis wearing one just like it.", "The next morning, Julia recounts the story about Baroness Dania being\nburned as a vampire witch during the 17th century. Legend has is that,\nbecause she died without being staked, her spirit is waiting around to\ntake over a body and return to life. As the day proceeds, Peter and Helga\nappear to be falling in love, much to the displeasure of Julia, who\nharbors incestuous feelings for her brother. That night, as the chanting\nand bongos begin again, Helga can barely stand the libido rising in her\nbody. Meanwhile, Wanda is thinking that Julia knows too much. When Wanda\nattempts to mesmerize Julia, however, Julia lifts her garlic cross and\nbreaks Wanda's spell. That night, the chanting and bongos again affect\nHelga, but this time Wanda tells Helga that she must get Peter's cross in\norder to make \"the throbbing\" stop.", "The next morning, Julia warns Peter that there is something going on\nat the castle that she doesn't quite understand but that it could lead to\ntheir destruction if they don't leave, but Peter doesn't want to go unless\nHelga goes with him. When Helga calls him to her room and pleads with him\nto help her because her body, soul, and mind are being destroyed, Peter\nremoves the garlic cross from around his neck and places it on Helga. When\nWanda sees the cross around Helga's neck, she grabs a poker, lifts the\nnecklace over Helga's head, tosses it in the fire, and smiles. Now there\nis nothing standing in her way. She admits to Julia, who is beginning to\nfigure it out (having written a book about the Vargas), that Wanda and her\nblack sisters, are actually priestesses of Baroness Dania and that they\nare planning for a mating between one of the sisters and a male descendent\nof Dania's line, an event that can only happen once every nine years\nduring a particular phase of the moon -- the night of the Vampire. Wanda\nalso tells Julia that she and her brother are descendents of the traitor\nDonnashova[sp?] who fingered Baroness Dania. Fortunately, one of her\npriestesses scooped up her ashes, and they have been been keeping Dania\n\"alive\" for these past 300 years.", "Now Julia is really concerned. She tries to talk with Monika, but\nMonika is \"asleep\" and Julia cannot awaken her, so Julia goes looking for\nher brother. As the sun sets, Monika wakes up and orders her friend, who\nis now her renfield, to bathe and dress her. When prepared, Monika and her\nrenfield head for the dungeon where the priestesses, along with Peter and\nHelga, are ready to perform the ceremony. Wanda kisses Monika, which\napparently passes Dania's spirit into Monika's body. Monika/Dania\nindicates that she wants to drink Helga's blood. Meanwhile, Julia is still\nsearching for her brother when she is attacked by bats who manage to rip\noff her clothes. Fortunately, Julia is able to hold on to her cross, and\nshe uses it to chase away the bats.", "The next morning, Peter returns to his bedroom to find Julia asleep\nin his bed. Julia tells him that she believes the vampire was reawakened\nlast night. Peter chastizes her for believing those \"old wives' tales\".\nAfter breakfast, Peter, Helga, and Julia go for a walk, during which Julia\nfinally convinces Peter to leave with her. They spend the day traipsing\nthrough the forest, but by nightfall they find themselves back at the\ncastle, where they are greeted by Monika/Dania, who plans to drink Julia's\nblood and watch her die on a stake. It's not going to be easy because that\ngarlic cross Julia wears is pretty powerful, so she sends Peter to seduce\nJulia and make her take off the cross. However, Julia notices that Peter\nis not wearing his cross and concludes that Peter is acting under the\nBaroness's power. Julia uses her cross to ward him off.", "Plan two is to make Peter strangle Julia, but Julia manages to ward\nhim off again. Later, Julia goes looking for Peter who, by now, is in the\ndungeon making love to and having his blood drunk by Monika/Dania. Julia\nis chased back to her room by two of the priestesses. A few hours later,\nPeter comes to Julia's room with no memory of where he's been or what he's\nbeen doing. She puts him to bed and places her garlic cross around his\nneck. When the priestesses begin to chant, Julia is unprotected and\nsuccumbs to their mesmerism. Fortunately, Peter is able to hold Julia back\nwith the cross and prevent her from going to them.", "Plan three is to send Helga to Peter with the message that, if the\nBaroness can't have Julia, she'll take Helga instead. When Helga runs off\nto join the Baroness, Peter grabs Julia and they follow Helga. She leads\nthem to an altar in the forest, where a stake has been erected. As Helga\nnears the stake, Julia shouts, \"No!\" Monika/Dania releases Helga and turns\nto Julia, biting her neck and drinking her blood. In her weakened state,\nJulia stumbles near the altar. As Monika/Dania keeps drinking, Julia\nbreaks off the tip of the stake. She falls to the ground, the Baroness\nzooms down on her, and Julia impales her on the stake.", "\"At last, they are free,\" Julia says, as she watches the priestesses\nwalk off in shock, \"and the Baroness, at long last, is at rest.\" [Original Synopsis by bj_kuehl.]"]},

The answer my friends is blowing in Zebedy Colt's VIRGIN DREAMS, an abstract erotic exercise made for Jean Jennings fans but bearing the influence of Ken's works.", "Plot is minimal and basic: young Jean is hardly a chip off the old block as her unlikely parents Zebedy Colt and Gloria Leonard (she must have been adopted) lament the prudishness of their offspring. They want her to marry boyfriend Wade Nichols, but Jean is puritanical enough to be played by Mary Pickford circa 1914.", "Film consists largely of Jean's dreams, escalating in their eroticism and explicitness. Colt has clearly been watching Ken's 1970s movies, as the dreams are accompanied by romantic classical scores, eventually segueing into hard rock (in the vein of Dario Argento's SUSPIRIA track, but predating that film), just as Ken was segueing into the music of The Who and Rick Wakeman in the mid-'70s. Even Colt's imagery evokes the master, though executed on a threadbare budget.", "What makes VIRGIN DREAMS most interesting is its odd point-of-view. We are witnessing virginal Jean's fantasies as she dreams, BUT in fact it is obvious that these are fantasies filtered through the weird mind of Zebedy Colt. So when she sees Nichols, riding along on his motorcycle with his erect penis saluting, clad only in boots, it is a homo-erotic image masquerading as a \"girl's fantasy\". Similarly, in one dream Jean is feeling the penises depicted on a series of full-scale paintings of studs hanging on the wall -we know where this is coming from.", "Known for his kinkiness, Colt stresses oddities, with incest frequently recurring involving both Leonard and himself with daughter Jean, an ejaculation scene where not only men but an actress does that deed; a crazy orgy on a bed out in the middle of the yard, spotlighting guest star Susan McBain performing a super-duper deep throat plus Terri Hall dancing around and having sex too; plus strange symbolism (maybe Ken can figure this out?) of Colt's penis represented by a flower as Jean has incestuous dreams about him.", "This makes for a highly arousing and definitely more professional movie than others in Colt's canon (e.g., the crude TERRI'S REVENGE). My main quibble was with the ending. Perhaps Colt painted himself into a corner but predictably once Jean's dreams/nightmares cease and she is deflowered in reality by Nichols the film segues to several false endings that are dull & silly. Finale of Jean appealing directly to the camera (first-person TCU to the viewer) with \"THE END\" appearing inside her open mouth is insulting.", "Another misstep is having Jean with heavy blue eye makeup throughout the film. It makes her look like a hooker or the star of a 1-day wonder circa 1971, not the virginal leading lady she's supposed to be playing. It reminded me of the telling scene in the otherwise horrendous 2001 French movie THE PORNOGRAPHER where director Jean-Pierre Leaud tells his leading lady Ovidie to lose the nail polish and other makeup that makes him want to throw up; soon after his mean producer takes over the shooting and immediately tells her to go and put the trashy makeup back on.

The metaphor of Findlay literally forced to project hardcore footage is obvious.

To personalize this filler is a pointless exercise; now that movies have been supplanted by homevideo & the internet, the result is today's multi-multi billion dollar industry devoted to generic porn. ", "Other than the recurring theme of fancy lingerie and black stockings, the loops are undistinguished, paced so that the money shots all come in the final reel, timed to the grindhouse audience's own rhythms. The alliterative and dirty-minded voice-over rant by Findlay, reminiscent of the purple prose from his '60s narrations & coming attraction patter, is worthy of a Brother Theodore, and consistently insulting to his target audience.", "Breaking up the nihilistic tone is an extremely effective introduction where Findlay's camera wanders down the Deuce as Ruby Keeler warbles the theme from the classic 1933 film 42nd Street. We see the marquees of the Rialto I, Rialto II, the Harem and the Victory, playing \"The Story of Joanna,\" \"Divine Obsession\" and \"Heavy Load\" among others. Findlay even shows the mainstream National theater around the corner, displaying \"Snuff\", a film derived from his footage that is his most famous work.

Best sequence is a white-on- white reverse gang-bang where several women literally smother Wade with affection and Findlay has shot everything in sharp detail.", "Elsewhere the murkiness of the presentation is a major drawback, making many of Vincent's stagings seem merely pretentious, especially with the cast in white-face that suggests that dreaded cinema device/cliché -mimes. Antonioni got away with it (though still suffering some ridicule) in the famous scenes in BLOW-UP, but it doesn't work well here.", "I had great sympathy for Wade's character and found the film overall to be quite moving. As an experiment (both Vincent and Findlay use pseudonyms probably to differentiate it from their day jobs as straight-ahead commercial pornographers) it may have failed, but I respect their trying to achieve something serious and lasting. ", "Vincent was very, very serious about breaking some barriers in society regarding sex cinema, as he emphasized in several interviews I did around the time of his would-be breakthrough ROOMMATES, and VISIONS also gives evidence of his artistic struggle to break free from toiling in the confines of a black sheep cousin to the mainstream entertainment industry.

That's not really a bad thing, however, as while it might not please all fans of this sort of stuff; the film does have enough to fall back on. Wicked Schoolgirls is an immensely cheap production and this is obvious at all times; be it through the bad picture quality, awful acting and/or the tacky script, and this is really what makes the film so fun to watch.

She's wearing a headband, red tank top and jeans.", "Referenced in ", " (2005)", "One of the late Ron \"Henri Pachard\" Sullivan's most criminally underrated efforts, this veritable gem of a movie apparently got lost in an all-consuming slipstream of contemporary carnal classics to his name that includes the likes of OUTLAW LADIES, SEXCAPADES and THE DEVIL IN MISS JONES PART II to reference but a few. Seemingly more single-mindedly sex-oriented than the movies mentioned, THE WIDESPREAD SCANDALS OF LYDIA LACE proves a first class fooler to boot. A wall to wall shag-fest judging by the look of things, scratch the surface and you will find that subtle veneer of social and moral criticism that characterizes all of the director's best work, compassionately exposing the hypocrisy that inevitably comes with being accepted into \"polite\" society. Bathed in stark lighting and mercilessly probed by veteran cinematographer Roberta Findlay's intimately inquisitive camera, characters are laid bare both literally and metaphorically. It's not always a pretty picture.", "Kudos to Ron for casting two seasoned veterans rarely allowed to take center stage. An aggressive MILF long before the term came into vogue with a pervasive peroxide do and hard-looking twin bullet boob job, forty-something Lee Carroll burns up the screen as Jennifer, an upwardly mobile psychiatrist married to a divorce lawyer named Duke. The latter's played by Ashley Moore who had been a ubiquitous stud presence since the early '70s but was somehow seldom called upon to act. Along with Findlay's uneven THE PLAYGIRL, this movie goes to prove just how much of an unwarranted oversight that was. Waking up, with Carroll in particular looking frightfully and unflatteringly realistic, it's a daily struggle as to who gets to use the bathroom first. Unbeknownst to their partner, each starts the day off with a shower solo. At the office, both of them have their work cut out for them. Their conflicting professions prompt Jennifer to remark that while she labors to keep families together, her husband does his level best to split them apart.", "Sullivan applies a unique technique to the mirroring sex sequences illustrating a single event from varying points of view. Think RASHOMON meets EVE'S BAYOU as a possibly coerced threesome with a married couple sharing the ample charms of a buxom blonde (the rarely seen Joey Karson, the scorned streetwalker from Roger Watkins's magnificent MIDNIGHT HEAT) at swingers club Château Fantasy - actually, the now long defunct Club O in lower Manhattan - drives its wed-locked participants towards the protagonists, she (very early days for fan favorite Joanna Storm) to get a divorce while he (Robert \"Bolla\" Kerman, solid as ever) still tries to figure out what the hell happened with the aid of shrink Carroll. As each recounts his or her version, the action materializes right there and then in the office with the professional caregivers fantasy-projecting themselves into the scene, filling in the role of the missing partner yet simultaneously remaining present as passive \"audience\" as well. For comic relief, there's Joey Silvera in jam jar glasses performing his usual goofy shtick as a chronically masturbating momma's boy.", "Holier than thou in public life, Duke finds an outlet for his suppressed urges in accommodating sex worker Lydia Lace, appealingly portrayed by the formidable Sharon Mitchell in a career performance. Their encounter hits fever pitch as Moore lets loose with a genuinely disturbing stream of verbal abuse, beautifully rebuked by the kind-hearted prostitute who will assume the role of catalyst in the recovery of the couple's spent passions. Film's final movement in a three act structure - which might as well be chapter-headed \"Home\", \"Work\" and \"Play\" - takes place at the fabled Château Fantasy which has been name-dropped enough by now to pique the main characters' imagination. Stalwart Sharon Kane and Lisa Be (hands on aunt Phyllis from Bill Milling's A SCENT OF HEATHER) have another three-way - clearly this film's signature sexual combination - with thuggish Joey Santini, the swarthy New York performer best remembered as the horny shutterbug from Tom De Simone's odd PASSAGE THRU PAMELA. The live act's provided by Dena Ferrara (DMJ II's Cleopatra) taking on mullet-head Kenny Dee, who played the spa attendant in Shaun Costello's HOT DREAMS, and extremely effeminate one shot Rubin Torrid. Always a bridesmaid, never a bride, Susan Nero makes another memorable cameo as a high-powered attorney playing little girl games with kinky couple Lisa Cintrice (another auntie, from Jim \"Clark\" Buckley's DEBBIE DOES DALLAS 2) and Sean Elliot, a solid performance under the tutelage of \"Cecil\" Howard Winters in both SCOUNDRELS and FIRESTORM. Perhaps inspiring latter film's celebrated \"red scene\", movie closes on the haunting dark room Sapphic seduction of Jennifer by Mitch and Storm, playing out in sacred silence to optimal erotic effect.", "While indeed packed with porn, movie does a commendable job tying all of it to the central narrative by keeping the action grounded in character and evolving naturally from recognizable day to day situations. Sullivan once again proves his mettle, not just as the fine filmmaker we know him to be but as a grade A pornographer as well. There's a subtle yet significant difference that true genre fans greatly appreciate. Falling into this select category would be a Lasse Braun or an Alex de Renzy, with John Stagliano as a more recent addition. Most of the sex here is absolutely scorching in both performance and execution, equal parts ravishing and raunchy, similar in style and intensity to Gerard Damiano's stupendous THE SATISFIERS OF ALPHA BLUE. I had the incredibly good fortune to see this at an honest to goodness adult theater, the unsung ABC cinema in Brussels, amazingly still operational as the first decade of the new millennium draws to a close ! Ramble about privacy and potential embarrassment all you like, kind of appropriate within this particular context, but Golden Age porn was specifically designed to be seen on a big screen, preferably with a vast audience, which enhances its impact immeasurably."]},

I just saw it on Maryland Public Television and it was a real event for me. I know both of the remakes, the Disney cartoon, the Prokofiev ballet, and the film EVER AFTER. But I'm a vintage T.V. junkie at heart, and more than anything else, this production was a phenomenal advancement in TV entertainment. Differing from the broadcast adaptation of the Broadway musical PETER PAN- and as Julie Andrews herself mentions in the opening monologue- this production was originally written for television by Rodgers & Hammerstein themselves. And it is the quirky, tongue-in-cheek script which is one of the show's delights. The biggest delight by far, is the fact that this was a LIVE performance, shown warts and all- like a boom mike shadow on a draping wall or a missed song cue in the second act. This performance occurred roughly six months ahead of the first ever videotaped images. No CGI or ILM movie effects here. Once you fully understand that, you can suspend yourself completely into a more innocent and wondrous frame of mind and let the performances and especially the music speak for themselves. A cleaned up, remastered kinescope film, you'll notice the unusually high contrast in some of the darker images and nighttime sequences. But the \"Impossible\" Act 1 finale with Andrews and gorgeous fairy godmother Edie Adams is still a stellar moment, from the sparkler lighting effects to the final shot inside the moving coach. And it is nice to see so many surviving cast members (Kaye Ballard, Edie Adams, and Jon Cypher) comment on this 47-year-old production. I loved it!!"]},

I recall later episodes and when I heard the opening score (being a well composed classic) at a much later age, it rang a bell to when I was probably four or five years old.  Firstly, it was made on a shoe string budget and I later discovered that most of the actors also played their own stunts.  It has a blend of great Australian actors and most of them would later be noticed on other Australian television.", "What made this television series special in my humble opinion, is recalling that most of the episodes that I saw were all urban based, being something very very rare for Australian television, as most of Australian television is always based on the outback, unfairly giving an international image of Australians as only rural in nature (hoping not to offend anyone here). This is one feature of Australian television that really annoys me, and the portraying of a one sided image of Australian life does not do Australian culture much justice, especially, ignoring the fact that there are also skyscrapers and densely populated cities. The series \"HOMICIDE\" did try to fill in this Australian picture.  By the same token, anyone who enjoyed this series would also enjoy the rural counterpart \"MATLOCK POLICE\", being in my humble opinion the rural equivalent of 'HOMICIDE\" - and also amongst Australia's very best television.  This would have to be amongst Australia's earliest and sadly the very best of Australian television series."]},

It certainly got under mine. In fact, it's still there although it doesn't itch quite as much as it once did. If you doubt me, watch writer/commenter Dayton Duncan fight back tears as he recounts Meriwether Lewis' heartbreaking demise in Ken Burns' PBS special on Lewis and Clark. The journey of the Corps of Discovery, as the expedition was entitled, occupies the emotional center of the history of the West in the same way that the Civil War occupies the specific history of the South. More than a few people now living would be tempted to sell their souls for the chance to jump back to 1804 and push off up the Missouri River with the Corps. Only the infected will understand.", "Actually, I have Dayton Duncan to blame for my infection. I picked up his book, `Out West', a chronicle of his attempt to retrace some of the Lewis and Clark Trail (in a VW bus) at a yard sale and acquired the bug. From then on, any Lewis and Clark site had to be seriously out of the way from me to not attempt a visit. When I stood at Lewis' grave in rural Tennessee, reputedly on the spot where he died, I can't lie. I was moved. (I still want to see the site of the Two Medicine Fight, in which Lewis and his detachment, which had split off from the main party on the return journey, had been forced to kill two Blackfoot warriors; the only two Native Americans to die at the expedition's hands. It was an act for which the stratospherically-principled Lewis paid in kind (he was accidentally shot and severly wounded by one of his own men while hunting not long after the fight (unmentioned in the series); a pity as this sub-expedition was largely unnecessary.)", "Despite its suave production, enchanting music track and heartfelt commentary by various historians including the late Stephen Ambrose, Ken Burns' rendering of the Lewis and Clark tale is just adequate historically. This is not to say I didn't like it. I thoroughly enjoyed it, both my initial viewing and a recent repeat broadcast. But there is so much more meat on the bones of this great adventure than the series was able to bite off. Anyone coming away from it with a case of the bug should definitely learn more. Allow me to suggest a course of action.", "Much information resides on the Web but will often not tell you much more than the PBS production. Still, these sites can be fun. But don't be afraid to go analog as well. Find a good book or two on the subject.They're out there and will serve up more details. My favorite (out of print but still findable in a good bookstore or library) is `Lewis and Clark: Partners in Discovery' by John Bakeless. Here, you'll acquire a detailed, sensitive account of not only the expedition itself, but of the childhood and coming of age of Lewis and Clark, their experience as army officers on the frontier (then in Ohio) that laid their foundation as incomparable woodsmen, how the expedition was planned and outfitted, and what became of the many of its members after the return. Bakeless also makes a haunting and persuasive case for the possibility that Lewis did not commit suicide but may have been murdered; something I have always thought possible, certainly along the Natchez Trace, which in 1809 was probably the most dangerous place in North America. (This excellent book really should be re-printed for the bicentennial.)", "Another interesting book (also out of print) is `Two Captains West' by Albert and Jane Salisbury. Not as scholarly as the Bakeless, it's still a worthy read and filled with photos of many actual Lewis and Clark sites, including some that are less well-known and, thereby, even more interesting to buffs. Once you've acquired a workable overview of the expedition, take the plunge into the actual journals that were compiled along the way by the Captains. At least two editions are extant, the most accessible being the abridged version by Bernard DeVoto, based on the original, complete journals (seven volumes and maps) published by Reuben Gold Thwaites in the early 1900's. At first, you may find the language challenging but eventually it will charm you. Then, go back to the PBS production for dessert. However, if you have not visited at least a couple of sites, I'm not sure we can call you a true buff. But once you're through DeVoto, your application for membership will be considered. And don't forget the aforementioned Dayton Duncan book.You'll like it.", "A few months back, some soulless MBA-type did an article for the equally soulless e-zine, Slate, in which he disclaimed the importance of Lewis and Clark because they failed to find the Northwest Passage. This is rubbish, of course. The Passage was never there. How could the expedition have failed by not finding it? The importance of the Corps of Discovery lies not what it did, (which is still remarkable, Lexus Boy), but in what it symbolizes, what it says about the enormous promise that America once embodied, and the tough, resourceful people we once were. It speaks to a time when it was still not too late to rationally and humanely inhabit a world of profound beauty and natural harmony; a world in which the civil and hospitable Mandans, the incredibly noble Nez Perce, and even those pesky Teton Sioux and Blackfeet, all with knowledge to impart, had a place. We have actually fallen far, only to make temporary soft landings in our Lincoln Navigators. Lewis and Clark were geniuses, not of academia but in how they, and their command, manifested intelligence, compassion, and courage, often in the face of hardship we can barely imagine."]},

If you were ever looking for a real-life Archie and Edith Bunker, all you had to do was look at the Bergs. The question which caused this episode to be an unforgetable one was : \"Ladies, how would your husbands complete this phrase : My husbank is a closet blank?\". Most of the ladies predicted their husbands would say \"freak\" and \"case\", but Edie's answer of \"queen\" caused everybody in the studio (even Bob Eubanks) to bust out in laughter. When the husbands came back to guess what the wives predicted, Charlie said \"case\". Eubanks told Charlie to \"brace yourself\", and when Charlie found out what his wife said...his expression was priceless. To say he was embarassed would probably be an understatement.

Additionally, some viewers may find the series to be overly dark and depressing, as it does not shy away from the more brutal aspects of the story.", "In conclusion, \"Power Without Glory\" is a must-watch for anyone interested in Australian history, politics, or society. The series is a powerful and thought-provoking exploration of the corrupting influence of power and the struggle for justice in a society that is rigged against the disadvantaged. It is a series that will stay with viewers long after the final credits roll. Despite its flaws, it is a true masterpiece of Australian television, and a testament to the power of great storytelling."]},

Culture Wars - Explores three key instances of anti-gay backlash - the murder of Julio Rivera; the release of Marlon Riggs' film Tongues Untied; and Oregon's Ballot Measure 9 - in the midst of the AIDS crisis and the gay community's response to these. 3. Hollow Liberty - Focuses on the federal laws and policies that effectively restrict the rights of gay and lesbian Americans and relegate them to second-class citizens, specifically the military's discriminatory history and the Supreme Court's 1986 Bowers vs. Hardwick decision. 4.

Nick Hancock would duly produce an obvious prop to demonstrate the pet hate (you can imagine what was brought out when someone mentioned they didn't like 'Baked Beans'), Hancock would work his way through some hackneyed scripted comedy and video clips, we'd laugh or pants off, and if the item was deemed worthy of being in 'Room 101' (ie) oblivion, it'd find itself on a small conveyor belt, (which looked like it had been nicked from the 'The Generation Game', through some swishy Star Trek doors to the tune of some chart-topping inanity, usually by Black Lace.

It's not deep for Richard E. Grant to tell us he doesn't like booze (or whatever - I think that was one of his). And so it goes with Mr. Merton.

His parents died in a car crash a few months earlier and his grandfather did not want him, but had to take him.

He runs out of the apartment and his grandfather follows.", "Out on the sidewalk, Jimmy meets up with a man dressed as Santa Claus who knows his name. The man leads him into his Santa shop and starts telling him a story about a boy named Tim who lived in Wales long ago. Tim's paternal grandfather refused to acknowledge his existence, since his son married a gypsy girl. His father dies in a war and his mother dies in childbirth, so Tim is raised by his maternal grandfather. Fourteen years later, they return to where Tim was born and Tim has to deal with being part Roma and part gadjo.", "The Wales part of the story is the main part and it has nothing to do with Christmas. At the end of the film, however, the story returns to Santa, Jimmy and Jimmy's grandfather, who had entered the shop and listened to the whole story, too. Welsh actor Gweirydd Gwyndaf plays both Jimmy and Tim, and his paternal grandfather is Edward Woodward in both time periods. One could see it simply as two stories with the same lessons to be learned, or as a reincarnation story where lessons once again weren't being learned. Whatever it's meant to be, it's a truly interesting story with an excellent cast. Too bad it isn't shown every Christmas or at least available for streaming somewhere."]},

You have a great cast, full of veteran actors who all played their parts well. Many reviewers have commented on the boy characters nauseating faith in \"god\" and the nature of what god is. Some others have also commented that the usual King treat is depicted of a good ol' moral spar between good and evil but I don't see it as such. It was noted many of times that King had either begun this story while he had substance problems and or finished the book (story) in rehab. If this is true, then it's possible that the authors own bouts with the man upstairs became apparent in this film. Either way, I can see why the complaints but personally the kid and his faith didn't bother me. What bothered me was for a King film this ended too fast and no scary, slimy monsters to swat back into the darkness. But due to the villain mainly being bodiless is a new approach and was executed rather well. Another film (for TV) before this (I forget the names) wasn't all too great either.

Martin Scorsese, George Lucas, Steven Spielberg, John Milius, Teri Garr, Brian DePalma, David Brown and author Linda Myles are all interviewed. What this episode basically does is look at the \"new\" type of filmmakers that were taking over the early 70s and each one are able to discuss their first movies, how they got their break and go onto discuss some of their bigger pictures. Spielberg probably gets the most attention as he talks about shooting 8mm films as a child, getting to work at Universal on TV projects and then of course breaking big with JAWS. Lucas talks about feeling that he only had one shot in Hollywood and discusses how the studios just didn't think his films were going to connect with an audience. Even Scorsese talks about thinking that no one would see MEAN STREETS and he discusses what he thought was going to be a disastrous preview at Warner. Another running theme deals with the foreign influence that all of these filmmakers had. Each talk about the foreign directors that influenced them and we hear how DePalma wanted to be the next Godard but instead went towards Hitchcock. Fans of these artist are certainly going to enjoy this look back at their careers but it's also just fun seeing how they got started and what Hollywood was like at this time."]},

The peculiar filmmaker Bigas Luna (Jamon Jamon, Yo Soy La Juani) directs this co-production starring Olvier Martinez (Unfaithful), Aitana Sánchez Gijón (La Carta Esferica) and Romane Bohringer (Vigo) . Passable interpretation from Olivier Martinez as Horty, a French foundry worker who wins a contest and is sent to see the sailing of the Titanic while meets a beautiful chambermaid called Maria, finely performed by Aitana Sánchez Gijón, with whom he shares the hotel room .", "The motion picture was decently directed by Bigas Luna , following his particular style , though displays a number of flaws and gaps. He often uses in his films twisted events , erotic scenes and surrealist images. Luna was a Bon Vivant who along with his wife, produced wine, ham, and organic products ; they are well shown in his films . In 1990 producer Andrés Vicente Gómez persuaded him to return to cinema and entrusted to him the direction of Las Edades De Lulú (The Ages of Lulu), an erotic drama about a young woman exploring extreme sexual practices , this was a commercial success . Without abandoning his dedication to painting and photography, reflected in numerous exhibitions, he began the well-known \"Iberian Trilogy\" with Jamón Jamón (\"Ham, Ham\", 1992), Huevos de Oro (\"Golden Balls\", 1993) and La Teta y La Luna (\"The Tit and the Moon\", 1994). Jamón Jamón, which launched the careers of both Javier Bardem and the 16-year-old Penélope Cruz was a major international success and won the Silver Lion at Venice in 1992. Cruz returned in Volavérunt (1999), a film about the relationship between Francisco Goya and the Duchess of Alba . This film ¨La femme de chambre du Titanic (1997)¨ is stylishly photographed and smartly designed and here Bigas Luna delivers his ordinary and erotic goods in cool sense of style . Rating : 5.5/10 .

The mystery is being investigated by both a local constable as well as a former railroad detective who has just recently returned from service in WWI, where he was a \"flying ace\" (Laurence Criner). There's another man who flies planes as well, someone who is frustrated by his unrequited love for the station manager's daughter, and we get a taste of his character when after having his marriage proposal turned down he says \"Confound the perversity of woman. (sic) The next time I get her in that plane of mine, she'll say YES or get out and walk on a cloud.\" As there aren't a lot of possible characters in the cast who could be suspects we get the idea that he may have had something to do with it. It's not quite as simple as that and the ethyl chloride knockout spray was a nice little touch, but it would be hard to recommend the film based on the creaky mystery alone. Meanwhile, the scenes in the air are brief and clearly shot on the ground, without the benefit of a long shot or even stock footage, so the film is certainly lacking in the kind of production quality that you would see from the big Hollywood studios.", "On the other hand, it's simply fantastic that a film made in 1926 featured an all-black cast without stereotypes, and with a variety of role models, not the least of were the aviators who inspired the young men who grew up to become Tuskegee Airmen (this according to TCM's fabulous Jacqueline Stewart). For a white director and studio head Richard E. Norman to show a heroic and intelligent black war pilot at a time when they weren't allowed to fly planes in the military, and wouldn't be until 1940, deserves credit for the statement it was making. And I have to say, if the story drags a bit for you despite the quick 65 minute runtime, stick around for the final reel, when the one-legged sidekick (Steve Reynolds) pedals his bicycle furiously in pursuit of the bad guys, busts out the gun he's concealed in his crutch, and then pursues them on foot. That was brilliant, and I really enjoyed this character. Lastly, Kathryn Boyd is a cutie as the station master's daughter, and the few close-ups she gets, one shedding a tear and others of her flirting with the hero at the end are wonderful.", "It's definitely not the best silent film out there, but for what it represents and these characters, it's worth checking out."]},

It had curiously languished in obscurity for decades, following its inclusion in Gold Key's Scream Theater television package, mostly consisting of low grade titles from the Crown International Pictures catalog, which is how it received its lone broadcast on Pittsburgh's Chiller Theater on Jan 15, 1977. It was actually 20th Century-Fox that issued the film on its initial 1969 run, and only earned a proper DVD release in 2010. A historic document of long anticipation, we hear the voice of the late President John F. Kennedy proclaiming the nation's goal to put a man on the moon before decade's end, then television coverage before takeoff on July 16, millions of people present near Cape Kennedy in Cocoa Beach, once airborne keeping in contact with the Space Center in Houston (I DREAM OF JEANNIE picked the right time to star an astronaut!). There is a steady stream of commentary from the three astronauts, Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins, and an occasional voiceover from 19th century author Jules Verne, who proved most prescient in his own predictions of space travel, right down to the eerily identical size and weight of the spacecraft. The narration by Dr. Wernher Von Braun is thankfully not very intrusive, filling in the gaps where necessary. The pace inevitably drags during the period preceding the actual landing (at 54 minutes) and first walk on the moon, which all these years later has lost none of its power, Buzz Aldrin aptly describing the sight as 'magnificent desolation.' In the end it remains a fascinating look back to one of America's best documented triumphs, and while Gene Roddenberry's STAR TREK was still on NBC as well. Chiller Theater audiences of 1977, so familiar with all the science fiction classics set in outer space, got to share in the real thing on that long ago Saturday night."]},

Her college friend, Karla (Brandy Norwood) wins tickets to the Bahamas via a radio station contest, so she, Karla, Karla's boyfriend, Tyrell (Mekhi Phifer), and a friend Will, head off on vacation. Meanwhile, Ray (Freddie Prinze Jr.), Julie's ex-boyfriend, has an encounter with the fisherman again, and heads to the island to save Julie. But soon enough, bodies begin to pile up on the mostly-deserted island (which is currently in it's storm season) all around Julie and her friends, and it seems the fisherman has returned.", "I considered the original \"I Know What You Did Last Summer\" to be a fairly good slasher movie that evolved during the late '90s. It had a nice revenge-laced premise about teenagers who had to pay the consequences for their mistakes at the hands of a psychotic fisherman, and it was very well done in comparison with most slasher movies of that era. This sequel popped up only a year later, and while it may be very unoriginal, it's still entertaining. In terms of story, the idea was well put together, and the tropical, stormy Bahaman island was the perfect setting for this film to take place, and a nice change from the gloomy coastal town the previous film was set in. I knew a sequel was coming, after the first film succeeded well with audiences, it was nearly inevitable. The violence factor is much more gratuitous in this sequel, it's gore galore for this movie, which wasn't surprising. It seems that way for a lot of horror movie sequels.", "Also, being no surprise, this film is almost beyond cliché-ridden. Typical horror set-ups, scares, and character stupidity is present throughout the course of the movie. It's unrealistic a lot of the time, and there are plot holes everywhere, so in that sense, it's a bit of a mess. But on the other hand, despite all of the unrealistic events, I have to admit that this is an extremely entertaining movie. Jennifer Love Hewitt and Freddie Prinze Jr. reprise their role, and Brandy Norwood and Mekhi Phifer play her lively friends. Jennifer Esposito (whose career hadn't quite taken off yet) also plays a worker on the island who the gang teams up with when the fisherman begins to off the island's population. The acting was nothing more than average at best, but it was tolerable (nothing too bad, I have seen much worse). But besides, what can you expect from this type of flick? The film ends with one of those \"gotcha!\" jump scares quite similar to the ending of the original, and puts a close on this series (unless you count the 2006 direct-to-video sequel that follow this) on a rather silly but fitting note. The entire movie is a little far-fetched, but so what?", "Overall, I'd advise anyone who is tired of your run-of-the-mill slasher movies to avoid \"I Still Know What You Did Last Summer\" like the plague, because I can guarantee that they will be sorely disappointed. But for those who enjoy some cheap horror entertainment every once and awhile, this clichéd little slasher sequel is an entertaining way to spend a couple of hours, but don't expect to take any of it seriously. 6/10."]},

(Given that the millennium is just around the corner, 2000 seems like a quaint choice for evoking the world of the future.)", "We enter the studio of a space-age DJ, spinning platters and cyber-broadcasting erotic adventures, like some pirate radio station off the coast of Baja. Our hostess is the lovely and ever-uninhibited Jacqueline Lovell, in silver shorts and halter-top, wiggling her behind as The Shape Of Things To Come.", "The first episode stars Taylor St. Claire as a woman trapped in a nightmarish world of recovered memory and alien abduction. There's really not much to this episode: it has a beginning, a middle, and an end...not necessarily in that order.  And we get to see a fair amount of the naked and luscious Taylor St Claire, even if her performance is in the key of Hysteria.", "In the bridge between this episode and the next, the camera meanders into the broadcast studio and, like some spooky voyeur, silently watches Jacqueline and another woman fondle and undress each other.  When our two space lovers finally notice the camera (and presumably us), they scramble for their clothes and the moment is gone. I do have to admit that Jacqueline's surprise is so convincing that I really wondered if the director had interrupted an unscripted moment.  Like much of this movie, everything seems to happen by accident.", "The second episode is the simplest and most cohesive of the three and has the best of the erotic scenes.  Our fearless heroine is a swaggering space pirate, like a blonde Bruce Willis, cracking wise to her alien captors and having sex with anyone in the neighborhood: with another human prisoner (male), with her alien cell-mate (female) and even with her alien captor (also female).  The sex scenes are long and well-done, even if the lighting, meant to evoke the dark, claustrophobic confines of the prison, can be a bit distracting.", "I did have a difficult time in matching the players in this scene with the names in the final credits.  Was our blonde space jockey named Juno? And was she played by the elusive Lisa Sutton AKA Lisa Comshaw AKA Tori or Tory Sinclair AKA Fawna?  Well, you get the idea.  My only real success was identifying the alien cell-mate, played by the voluptuous and oddly-named J. Nichole Italiano-Zaza, (better known as Nikki Nova.)", "Last, we have the most muddled of the episodes as we follow some poor schmuck lost in the Time Machine, travelling  from the present year back to the 50's, and then fast-forwarding to some future dystopian Mad Max scenario and finally back in history to the days of the cave-man.  I abandoned any hope of continuity or logic and just enjoyed the ample displays of naked flesh.  The scene finally comes to an end, more by running out of steam than through any plot device.", "And as the movie lurches towards the exit, we are finally rewarded for our patience, watching Jacqueline Lovell slowly strip to some perky, futuristic Musak, with neither the camera nor Jacqueline shy about providing us with some clinical glimpses of her anatomy.  Credits finally roll and we see out-takes of the cave-man scenes and listen to someone off-camera give directions and then finally call for a lunch break.  The director was apparently reluctant to waste any footage and so we have a movie that feels as cobbled-together as Dr. Frankenstein's creation.", "My advice is simply to remember that it's late at night and there's probably nothing else on.  So relax, enjoy the abundant nudity, and don't search for deeper meanings.  There aren't any."]},

This is not all: the film reserves a few more surprises for the viewer. It is interesting that the title character, when transformed, is played by an acrobat, and apparently the movie included a nude scene by De Hoyos, one of the pioneers of female nudity in commercial Mexican cinema, although the copy I saw only ran 78 minutes and there was an obvious cut when her full naked body was about to be revealed.

It's not entertaining in the least, and it's off-putting to the max. And such a shame to ruin this great series by portraying the character this way. The series didn't start this way. Somewhere after the first year or 2, someone got control of the production and steered the show in a different direction. It's too bad. They ruined it."]},

Viewed from a modern standpoint, when the filmmakers' Zionist cause has long since been achieved, this movie's original purpose is no longer relevant.

One of the very best moments in this picture was when violin virtuoso Saundra Berkova, she was only 18 years old when they filmed her scene, and man what a talented chick! She was incredible and just jams through Mendelssohn's Violin Concerto! Interestingly she was involved in a marijuana party bust in the 1950's in Hollywood! Being a former 420 head myself, I thought that was kind of cool that she may have smoked pot! Apparently no charges were brought against her and she was released! I couldn't believe that I was watching the actress who would later play Granny on The Beverly Hillbillies show! Come to find out that Irene Ryan was a very talented actress and when she was a young woman she was very nice looking! Of course Elinor Donahue was so cute, and popped off with some great lines in the flick! Elinor and actor Jimmy Lydon may be the only living cast members of this picture! The pictures director Arthur Dreifuss started a production company to produce this picture and one other film under the banner of Vinson Pictures, \"Shamrock Hill\" also released in the same year of 1949! (I also have a 16mm print of that picture as well and I love them both!) I wouldn't be surprised if the 35mm cut nitrate negatives and soundtrack rolls were left to decay in some storage unit someplace? Frances Rafferty was a babe! So was Rosemary La Planche and Shirley Mills! Everybody in this picture was great! So if you're not a jaded fool, check out this picture!

Though it is very (maybe too much) original and initially interesting, doesn´t have any strength to keep you asking for more... in fact, if it wasn´t for the amazing performances (Amalia Pérez Díaz above all... definitely she is the best actress of Venezuela., what a work!) you´d wish the film to finish in half an hour. The prison scene with the people screaming is quite creepy and maybe the best of the film. The only good point of the screenplay is the relationship between Amalia´s character with her two sons. This film probes that you can do a quite good film just with great actors and a good direction, but it´s also the probe that a potential great picture may go down without a good screenplay."]},

(Saw \"Slaughter High\" twice--first time, I was young and terrified, second time, older and bored. I don't recommend it.)

It's not a new plot, but what's done with it is what's unique. I don't remember all the characters too well, but the lesbian takes near-center stage as the leading lady, which I found to be a surprise, since the lesbian is usually just that. All the characters are utterly likeable, even the promiscuous girl. She may have been one of the sweetest characters, and her demise is heartbreaking. (C'mon, you knew it would happen.) From the murders in the film I remember (one of which I can't remember at all, God, my memory sucks), the one involving the killer dressed as a hunter and the character trying to escape outside was probably the scariest. You actually think she's going to make it, seeing how long the scene went on (once again, if I remember correctly). Add to that the stark daylight which is far scarier than the scene may have been at night. (Why don't more filmmakers realize this? Daytime can be extremely scary. See the climax to \"Texas Chainsaw Massacre.\" An early-morning nightmare.) Anyway, I must be giving the worst review right now, but I thought I'd let people know that this is actually a very tense movie, with a merciless atmosphere of doom. It's not obvious who will live and who will die, and overall, you want everyone to survive, even the \"bad girl\" (who isn't bad at all!). The killer dons a couple creepy costumes--the hunter and the clown were pretty freaky (need I add--if I can remember). And while some of the peripheral plotlines concerning this killer are somewhat perplexing, don't let that turn you off to this movie. It's worth seeing, if you can find it. If I can remember : )."]},

In fact, the stories are far closer in spirit to the original Leslie Charteris novels than either the Ian Ogilvy series that preceded, or the Val Kilmer movie that followed them, and Simon Dutton's Saint, whilst lacking the cheeky charm of George Sanders or Roger Moore, is stylish and debonair with an air of menace about him.", "This particular film has an odd but engaging plot, combining a story about the machinations surrounding the selling of a theme park (pure 'Dynasty') with a case of human sex trafficking (like something from a Hong Kong revenge movie). Whilst a little overlong, it does see the Saint actually doing some international jet-setting (thanks to Australian co-production), and features a thrilling fifteen minute proto-parkour sequence, very much ahead of its time, involving the Sydney monorail system and a tall ship! The 80s will never be cool, and the Saint perhaps needs a lighter touch (the character sometimes betrays his 1920s origins - kidnapped underage girls forced into prostitution in foreign cities aren't really \"damsels in distress\" looking for a \"white knight\", Simon), but this is better than you've probably heard."]},

To be honest with you I don't think either story is the greatest out there and that's probably why they were turned into just one film instead of being made into two. That's not to say these are weak stories but I don't think either one carried enough drama to warrant their own movie. With that said, their still interesting enough to warrant four-minutes each and as usual the filmmakers do a nice job at telling the story and John Nesbitt's narration is wonderful as usual.

Christian Erickson is a leader in the Humanitarian Order of Chivalry on assignment in Angola with his team of 'sweepers' who are attempting to clear land mines from around rural villages where villagers and children are being maimed and killed daily. During one sweeping operation, Christian's 11 year-old son Johnny follows his father to a mine field and during a rebel attack is killed when he steps on a land mine. Back in America, a terrorist attack at the home of a US senator utilizes a new super advanced A-6 land-mine smuggled in from Angola. Bomb squad expert Michelle Flynn, who watched her fiance die in the attack, is sent on a covert operation to Angola to recover an A-6 mine, so that the political intrigue behind its manufacture can be revealed. Michelle joins forces with two army mine sweepers, Jack Trask and Ray Gunn but their mission turns deadly when Jack and Ray are killed as the very land mine they had retrieved blew their helicopter apart, leaving Michelle alone and stranded in Angola. Having witnessed Christian, drunk in a local bar, stand up to the local thug Yager who terrorizes villagers with land mines in order to protect his diamond mining and smuggling rackets, Michelle seeks out his help. Together they retrieve an infamous A-6 land mine from the same field where Christian's son was killed. In their quest to find the source of the deadly new land mines, Michelle and Christian uncover a devious plot to ship a trainload of the mines to the US. In an explosive showdown, Christian and Michelle battle Yager's thugs in a 'to-the-death' fight through diamond mines and tortuous jungle until they finally uncover the real and most unsuspected villain behind the deadly scheme."]},

The battle goes to Mexico where Marshall has fallen in love with a beautiful Senorita (Ann May) but her father is under the impression that he's a bad guy so he must clear his name and defeat the bad one as well. This plot detail sounds like hundreds of other \"B\" movies that the genre would release at one per week once the 1930s came along. It's somewhat hard not looking at this film as being unoriginal but I'm going to guess that the plot was somewhat fresher in 1924, although today it comes off terribly dated due to all the other films that have been released since. Overall I had a decent time with the movie, although much like those \"B\" Westerns of the 30s, you're not going to be missing a Holy Grail if you decide not to watch it. The most memorable sequence in the film is when a robbery goes wrong and the stagecoach carrying the woman goes off on its own and Marshall must ride up to it and jump onto the horses. This scene was featured in the Hollywood documentary as the stuntman was seriously injured and it's easy to see why as the accident footage is still in the film. You can still clearly see where he misjudged his jump and ended up going under the stagecoach. This action scene is without question the highlight of the film. Fred Thomson was one of the bigger names in the genre back in the day but this was my first time seeing him. It's hard to judge someone by just one film but I thought he was mildly entertaining and at least was able to carry himself in front of the camera. Lowery is pretty good as the bad guy who hates the horse Silver King. Yes, even this era of Westerns had the special horse. Silver King isn't any better or worse than the various other horses out there but he certainly takes a beating in a few scenes including the over-the-top ending where our bad guy throws him into a bull ring. In the end there's not enough to recommend this to general or casual fans but I think those interesting in the genre will probably find enough to keep them entertained."]},

To each his own... ", "I've been a fan of it ever since 1979, when they first aired locally in my hometown, N'Awlins, every Monday-Friday afternoon @ 3:30 on ABC (now Fox) affiliate WVUE-TV Channel 8, on The Tom & Jerry Hour. It was a mixed bag of T&J cartoons, theatrical (1940 to 1967) and TV (1975 to 1977). This was how I first learned of these made-for-TV T&Js from H-B. The theatricals were great, but I (being a child of the 1970s and a connoisseur of Hanna-Barbera's mid-to-late 1970s work) somehow grew more attached to the 1970s version. Sometimes WVUE aired the main title sequence from The Tom & Jerry Show separately from the 48 7-minute T&J stories, sometimes they aired the end credits.", "I later read in Stuart Fischer's book Kids' TV: The First 25 Years that they originally aired in 1975 on The (New) Tom & Jerry/Grape Ape Show. I remember thinking, \"Ah! So that's where they came from!\" This is also how I learned of The New T&J's originally pairing with The Great Grape Ape, which I only discovered via repeats on ABC Sunday Mornings! (Yep, I missed out on the original run on ABC, and I had just come into it.)", "I decided that the 1970s T&J was my sole favorite, and faithfully followed its exploits from its first local airing on WVUE to its re-airing in the 1980s on WNOL-TV Channel 38 (now a WB affiliate) and Superstation WTBS, which, on Tom & Jerry And Friends, showed 7-minute 1975 T&J cartoons framed in-between main and end title sequences! I also realize that a huge number of serious animation fans have and continue to liken New Tom & Jerry to New Coke, calling it a cheap imitation of the originals, and thus giving them a bad rep over the years. I don't think it's all the 1975 version of T&J so much; I think a great many 'toon fans have prided themselves on being hooked on the originals and declaring any version out of that scope as inferior.", "Hence my web presence, The New Tom & Jerry Info Site @ http://www.1975tomjerry.50megs.com/ , which I launched in March 1997, to show all and sundry that there was someone out there who took interest in them and, to a degree at least, put an end to all the bad press they've been getting. Until January 2004 (so far), Boomerang from Catoon Network has done the 1975 T&J's justice by showing them periodically on Boomerang Saturdays (1976, 1977 and 1978). They neglected to show them in April 2004 during the weekly Friday T&J marathons; they seem to be limited to the 1940-67 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer theatricals, Filmation's 1980-82 version (The Tom & Jerry Comedy Show) and that 1990-93 Fox revival Tom & Jerry Kids (that gray stripe between Tom's eyes was not his best feature, IMHO!). But CN more than made up for this with the addition of the 1975 T&Js to their rotation in May 2005.", "Like I said, to each his own. Everyone here has his/her favorite version of Tom & Jerry; mine is and shall forever remain H-B's \"black sheep\" 1975 made-for-TV version.

Then there is even more German language than in its predecessor, a language which was already a tad too prevalent there for my liking. The musical soundtrack is a downsize too, here as well more in line with stuff you'd hear in a telefilm, we had quality live music in the predecessor after all. Also there seems to be something off in the acting chemistry between Thierry van Werveke (Johnny Chicago) and Ender Frings (Chuck Moreno).

One acting highlight though is the scene where he is alone with Nicole Max (Jenny Jacoby) outside the Chinese restaurant. The scene where Johnny meets with then local news anchor Sandy Lahure would be a national meme nowadays. To see the films' director Andy Bausch as pizza deliverer is worth a chuckle and hearing in Germany born Oscar Ortega Sánchez (Coco Moreno) uttering a few sentences in Luxembourgish is funny.

The first problem is that a keyhole that can be seen through would require a skeleton key, and no apartment in any big city, such as L.A., would still be using skeleton keys in 1994 -at least not as the sole lock for a front door. However, assuming that the skeleton keyhole was in that door, then the second problem is that Columbo would have been able to see only straight ahead, i.e., tunnel vision. People are not able to pan across the room through a keyhole.", "Followed by ", " (1995)", "This is definitely an original and different Columbo movie. Just like the previous \"Columbo: No Time to Die\", this movie its story got based on an Ed McBain novel. Not sure what the story was behind adapting these McBain novels, since its stories, atmosphere and settings have basically very little to do with the familiar usual Columbo franchise. Nevertheless, this is a movie that works out pleasantly because of its fine story.", "Might be difficult to really see this movie as a Columbo movie entry but as a stand alone movie its simply a fine one. It's also a nicely directed movie, that has a totally different look from the usual Columbo movie entry and breaths a totally different atmosphere. It has a more theatrical- and professional movie look so to speak. Vincent McEveety was a director who tried out many different things for the Columbo series and he succeeds with this movie at were Alan J. Levi failed with his other Ed McBain adaptation \"Columbo: No Time to Die\".", "It has a good detective mystery story, with a sniff of adventure to it, thanks to the whole jigsaw puzzle concept, that when put together shows the place were 4 millions dollars from a bank robbery-gone-wrong are hidden. The whole movie is about finding this pieces of the puzzle and the people that are holding them. At times the movie even has a touch of film-noir. It all sounds odd and out of place for a Columbo movie and yes it probably also is but nevertheless this concept, story and approach makes this simply a very fine and enjoyable movie to watch.", "It has really story that could had also been used for a successful full length theatrical released movie, having many big names in it. I must say that perhaps it would had been better all together if it indeed got made that way. Not that it's a bad movie right now but it would had worked out better all if it featured some original and fresh character and wasn't a part of the Columbo franchise, with Peter Falk in it as the famous police lieutenant. The story doesn't always connect well with the character and the movie also has some weaker, slower moments in it, when Lt. Columbo goes investigating and interrogation his suspects in his trademark own manner, which again, doesn't always correspond well with the style and atmosphere of the entire movie.", "Because of that for a part of the movie Lt. Columbo also needs to go undercover (hence the title; \"Columbo: Undercover\"), it means that Peter Falk's role is also different from any other thing he has done in any other Columbo movie. Guess he really enjoyed playing in this one! You could say that Columbo is not himself during this movie and he spends halve of the time pretending he is an Italian gangster. So no trademark Columbo moments really in this movie, which might disappoint you when you're expecting simply a Columbo movie like any other, that follows the usual successful formula and has all the familiar ingredients in it.", "There is also a load of some good and well known actors within this movie. Ed Begley Jr., Burt Young and Tyne Daly all show up. It definitely gives the movie something extra and they also really did one fine job playing their roles. Same also goes for Harrison Page, who I liked as Columbo's partner in this one. Sort of a shame and perhaps a missed opportunity that he didn't got featured in any other later Columbo movies.", "Really different from any other Columbo movie you'll ever see but it all works out fine and makes this a pleasant, different, Columbo movie experience.", "7/10", "http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"]},

I warn you, there is a hugely excessive amount of swearing and cussing in the dialog which is replayed over and over again, and while a little bit might have been done for shock value it is used simply too much. Also, due to the run-time, the film tends to echo in your head long after it is done, and because of the original intent of the film being to aggravate this was undoubtedly part of the director's goal.", "Frampton also experiments a different way with sound and image by sometimes fading out the picture so that only the arguing voices are heard for long periods.

Hopefully its sequel will also be imported to the U.S. (I've already emailed the local distrib with that request). Only drawback for fair weather fans is that it is untranslated (Italian soundtrack, no subtitles) but the action (and you know what action I mean) is easy to follow.", "Some ignorant clown has submitted to IMDb that Joe D'Amato co-directed the film, but there is no evidence of that. In fact, any knowledgeable fan watching it can see Luca's energy and light touch, compared to the ham-fisted \"I'm so bored\" mechanical approach that Joe brings to his many XXX assignments.", "Pasolini started it all with his hit DECAMERON in 1971, but this film actually reminded me more of the work of his talented protégé Sergio Citti, namely BAWDY TALES which I got to see in London back in 1974 but which unfortunately has never been released in any form here in America.", "Format is simple: a large group of folks is celebrating at the dinner table, with each man recounting a peculiar sexual experience he's had. These are bawdy, rollicking or sometimes just all-sex segments, given a different look by the period costumes, settings and beautiful castle location (same castle used by Luca for his fabulous film X HAMLET).", "The disco theme song from X HAMLET: \"To F**k or Not to F**k\" is reprised here as the opening credits song for DECAMERON, and gets one in the mood of frivolity and high spirits. I'm probably in the minority but I love this stupid tune, as anachronistic as possible.", "Although sex is the be-all and end-all of the movie, some of the segments are rather amusing. One clever and goofy one ends with the lover, who's telling the story, hiding in the closet when the woman's husband returns home suddenly. His balls literally get caught in the closet door and are hanging out, with the wife making up a cock & bull story about what they are. Hubby keeps slapping the balls, and it is the grotesque humor of which the Italians remain undisputed master. I'd like to see hacks like the Farrelly Brothers attempt this gag.", "Final 30 minutes of the film is devoted to an orgy which is perhaps the best directed screen orgy I've ever seen. Usually, in an American porn film of the '70s or say Tinto Brass's CALIGULA, an orgy is designed as filler -eating up as much screen time as possible with boring action. Often you can't really see what's happening, as the frame is just filled with bodies writhing around like a sexual 3-ring circus.", "Luca on the other hand keeps the energy level up, the mood of high spirits constant, and always photographs interesting sex action throughout this challenging sequence. Center of attention is Sarah Young, my all-time favorite porn star, taking on all comers, while the rest of the attractive female cast contributes to the arousal value as well. It culminates with a series of four money shots literally bathing Sarah's face and breasts, after which she smiles and waves goodbye at the camera, joined in by the entire cast in a sort of curtain call. This breaking-the-fourth-wall device was also used by Luca at the finale of X HAMLET, and is tremendously upbeat.", "I would recommend to any porn enthusiast the virtually mandatory 12-volume series THE GODDESS OF LOVE which features Sarah in her best porn vignettes, all beautifully photographed by Sascha Alexander. They aren't movies but do capture her timeless beauty and amazing enthusiasm for sex, a quality that can't be faked."]},

It was a pleasure finally getting to see it, in belated U.S. DVD release by Pearl Classics (in Italian, unsubtitled). Pearl also issued DECAMERON 3, a short feature which doesn't match up against any original Italian titles by Luca listed in IMDb, and suffers mightily in omitting Sarah Young from its cast.", "It's directed by prolific Italian pornographer Luca Damiano, who provides a stylish setting and costumes for the strictly XXX goings-on. Joe D'Amato has been entered as co-director in IMDb, with no substantiation, as usual by one of his idiot fans.", "Sarah Young stars as the Queen, with all attending her in court to present their ribald stories. The gimmick is that \"the queen is not amused\", so that when everybody laughs heartily at the end of each tale, they have to quickly shush themselves, as the Queen remains stern faced.", "Especially with no subtitles, I was not amused either at the antics, since the misogynistic stories each ended with an unfunny gag. Luca delivers the sex, but the film is light on the humor that was part & parcel to the cycle of Italian movies set in motion by Pier Paolo Pasolini's original THE DECAMERON over 40 years ago.", "What makes this film work, as with its predecessor, is the finale. Final two reels consist of Sarah rewarding Christophe Clark for telling the best tale, so after prepping by her two beautiful handmaidens, he gets to shtup Sarah every which way but loose. They had plenty of practice together in the classic video vignettes shot by her amanuensis Sascha Alexander circa 1992, but this 35mm film shoot displays Young's timeless beauty in a better light. Fans of this performance will enjoy another two-parter she made during this period, starring as Lucrezia Borgia in CASTLE OF LUCRETIA (alternate spelling intentional).", "Technical credits are excellent. I hope some enterprising U.S. video company will cough up and release a significant missing Sarah feature in America, NIKITA, a takeoff on LA FEMME NIKITA that was made when the previous Canadian TV series was making waves, but which takes on new relevance with the current Maggie Q edition on the air."]},

In real life, plenty of innocent people have been killed because some idiot with too much testosterone and not enough brain cells got behind a steering wheel. The last thing we need is movies which glorify this behaviour. I collectively call such films 'Scumball Rally' movies.", "Having encountered too many movies like this in the 1980s and '90s, I was mortified to discover that the genre was already firmly in place in silent films. \"The Drivin' Fool\" is one example.", "Henry Locke is a businessman in San Francisco, who has signed a contract requiring that he deliver a cheque for a large sum to a Wall Street broker by noontime a few days hence. If the cheque is not there to schedule, Locke will lose his business to his rival Howard Grayson. Locke thought he had sufficient time to post the cheque, but one of his assistants (Richard Browley) is secretly in Grayson's employ, and delays posting the cheque. Conveniently, there's a nationwide rail stoppage, so the cheque can't be couriered by train.", "This is the cue for Locke's son Hal to grab the cheque and zoom off cross-country in his racing car, gleefully ignoring petty details like speed limits and stoplights. I find this sort of storytelling hugely irresponsible. We're meant to admire Hal because he's trying to save his father's business, but it's obvious that the character is aroused by speeding (the movie's titles identify him as 'speed-mad'), and it's also obvious that the people who made this film expect the audience to admire Hal for his speedy habits.", "As if this weren't bad enough, the movie is also racist. Early in his cross-country motor trip, Hal acquires a Negro sidekick who rejoices in the name Horatio Jackson Lee, whom Hal promptly dubs 'Cupid'. Horatio -- played by a black man named Jesse Aldrich, who is clearly no actor -- indulges in plenty of 'yassuh' dialogue (supplied by the title cards), and some racial humour based on stereotypes of black people as cowardly or stupid.", "The actress Patsy Ruth Miller never greatly appealed to me. She was pretty and had some talent, but neither her looks nor her acting abilities were above the usual. She made precisely one major film -- 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame' -- but that film's successes owe very little to her performance. However, I met Ms Miller at Film Forum in NYC on the night of a screening of 'So This Is Paris', one of her movies. She generously consented to an interview, and spoke warmly to me of many people with whom she worked in silent-era Hollywood. My fond memories of that evening have prompted me to seek out as many of Patsy Ruth Miller's films as possible: regrettably, few of them seem to be very good. In \"The Drivin' Fool\", Patsy Ruth Miller plays the feminine love interest, but most of her scenes are at the beginning and the end of the film. After the contrived set-up to explain why the cheque can't be sent by post or by rail, the bulk of the movie is occupied with Wally Van's reckless driving and Jesse Aldrich's minstrel-show behaviour. The film's direction is weak, with some poor shot-matching. Sadly, I rate this movie only 2 points in 10, and I'm being generous."]},

The film is a great example of a successful political documentary. Loach manages to put across many political points without once being overly demonstrative or heavy. On the contrary, issues such as the betrayal of the workers by their bureaucratic union bosses are plainly and forcefully shown.", "As well as being a great political film, publicizing the struggle of the Liverpool dockers, \"The flickering flame\" can be seen as a comment on the condition of the working-class in Britain, or even throughout \"liberal\" Europe. The film shows British society's shift to the right and documents the taking away of rights that had been bitterly fought for in the past. Above all, the film shows the dignity of the Liverpool dockers and of their wives. It's a deeply human film that shows how workers who had given their lives to their jobs were unfairly dismissed simply for sticking to their beliefs. One of the best \"militant\" films of all time."]},
