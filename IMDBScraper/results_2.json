Having said that, the film is a major player in the so-called \"Renaissance of Brazilian cinema.\" It does deal with one of the most tragic events in the country's history, and tells the story exceedingly well. Featuring an outstanding cast, and directed by the respected Sergio Rezende, this movie when released was the best example to date that Brazil was indeed capable of producing a quality full-blown epic film with convincing drama, emotion, rhythm, and great cinematic beauty. Highly recommended for those who enjoy historical epics."]},

This film is, in comparison, practically unknown. However it manages to contextualize certain themes in the lives of Balkan gypsies. Set in a refugee camp run by the UN during the Balkan war, it is the story of a rom patriarch who is a good for nothing drunkard, with one vocation... he constantly dreams of returning 'home' to India (from where all gypsies are fabled to have started their cross-continental odyssey), to escape, once and for all, the persecution of gypsies by the local population. He befriends the UN area commander, an Indian, with the hope that the friendship would serve as a passport for him and his family to India. In the process, he even tolerates his daughter's dalliance with the UN commander, since he has been promised help with emigration by the guy. Ultimately, it ends in heartbreak, as the UN commander and his batallion of Indian troops are suddenly relocated, and he leaves without even a goodbye, leaving the daughter pregnant in the process. It is a poignant tale, but what was most interesting for me was the depiction of the hankering of the gypsies for Indian culture, in the form of Bollywood movies (there is a scene where the entire colony attends a open air screening of \"Bobby\" on VHS projected on a white sheet.", "Even as I recognised the scene as a depiction of the projection of an unreachable hope, the kind of stuff that keeps u going... I thought ... if only they knew how much more intolerant Indian society was towards their marginalised! This is a flawed yet wonderful little film and should not be missed by anyone with any interest in gypsy life and culture, if not for anything, simply because it depicts the other side of the coin... the side which mythmakers Gatlif and Kusturica fail to address!"]},

The very premise seems wholly outrageous until one realizes that Skippy the kangaroo is just the Australian equivalent of Flipper the dolphin or Lassie the collie, so why not? While I'm not familiar with the TV show this follows from, I'm given to understand the feature is very much effectively just an episode, writ large, and I think that definitely does come across in some of the sitcom-style levity that rounds out some scenes and characterizations. 'The intruders' may be just lighthearted family-friendly fare, but it's suitably enjoyable for a lazy day.", "Of course, as with other titles of this nature, the marsupial novelty is almost superfluous, flavoring added on top, for a tale of bad guys doing shady business and ultimately being discovered and/or foiled by scrappy young somebodies. We don't necessary get that that much screen time for our non-human friend, at least not as much as one might think; the bad guys, on the other hand, get a lot. In the meanwhile, we are treated to lots of sights of Australia in the 1960s - landscapes, cityscapes, and the surrounding waters. I'm not sure that this actually needed to be as long as it is, and the pacing is emphatically languid, even at the climax. Still, for any idiosyncrasies or issues one may discern, this is only intended for a passing good time, and it's well made such as it is. With the same cast and crew attached from the series it's clear that like care went into the production, with especially strong direction and cinematography, and solid acting. I quite like Eric Jupp's score, and the production design is excellent. Though too drawn out, the story is standard but entertaining, and any stunts or mild action sequences are done very well.", "There aren't really any surprises here. Whether an animal companion is (nominally) involved or not, we've seen this movie before, and we will again, with a likely PG rating. The broad strokes of the screenplay are very recognizable; whatever one wants out of this movie, I don't think there's anything about it so special as to demand viewership over comparable pictures. It's still a reasonably good time though, and if you happen to come across 'The intruders' it's worth checking out - only, one should perhaps temper their expectations about the involvement of the kangaroo who gets top billing, and have plenty of one's favored beverage on hand."]},

If you can't locate this very funny movie under its original title, try looking for it under the less offensive (and less funny) name 'Prudence'.", "The title 'Jewish Prudence' is of course a pun on 'jurisprudence', but it also refers to the character played by silent-movie comedian Max Davidson in his starring films. Davidson, who was indeed Jewish (and with strongly Semitic features), tended to play a stereotypical Jewish character on-screen. This can be unpleasant for modern viewers, but Davidson usually steered clear of the more vicious aspects of a Jewish caricature. His on-screen character tended to be resourceful rather than cunning, frugal rather than an outright money-grubber. Max Davidson reminds me of the English actor Ron Moody, whom he physically resembles: Moody has proudly used his Jewish heritage as a basis for most of his acting roles, yet his portrayals never become offensive.", "In 'Jewish Prudence', written by Stan Laurel and directed by Leo McCarey, Max is a father saddled with three grown children who will never amount to anything. His daughter (Martha Sleeper) is bone-idle. Max's older son (Jesse De Vorska) is an incompetent schlemiehl whom Max pressures into taking a job as a lorry driver. The younger son (Johnny Fox) is an idiot who wants to be a professional Charleston dancer. (Fair enough: that's how Lord Grade got started.) A handsome young lawyer (Gaston Glass), newly admitted to the bar, wants to marry Max's daughter, but Max refuses to consent until lawyer Gaston wins his first court case.", "When Max and his dancing son witness a road accident, Max sees a chance to make some money by persuading Johnny to fake a leg injury. There's an uproariously funny sequence in which Johnny feigns injuries by displaying a false leg while concealing his real leg inside a hollowed-out cushion. Of course, several things go wrong. (At one point, Johnny's got three legs showing.) When Max gets a visit from two men who seem to be insurance claims adjusters, Johnny plays his scam for all it's worth. This scene has a very funny payoff. Johnny Fox, who gave an amazing performance as the supernatural visitor in 'One Glorious Day', gives a splendidly physical performance here as Max's son. Eugene Palllette, hefting only a fraction of his later girth, is impressive as one of the visitors. Spec O'Donnell, who played Davidson's son in so many of his films, is absent from these proceedings.", "SPOILERS COMING. Meanwhile, Max brings suit against the driver who supposedly injured Johnny. The lawyer for the defence is none other than Gaston, who humiliates Max and Johnny in court by exposing them (hilariously) as liars and frauds. Gaston wins his case and then smoothly claims the right to marry Max's daughter. Max drives away in disgust, but his car is immediately hit by a truck. Gaston eagerly offers to represent Max in a lawsuit against the truckdriver, but the driver turns out to be (of course) Max's other son!", "'Jewish Prudence' is extremely funny; even more so because (unlike many other Hal Roach comedies of this period) it actually has a believable plot. Director Leo McCarey's comic pacing is brisk and excellent. The climactic trial scene in this film must have been good experience for McCarey when he directed Chico Marx's trial in 'Duck Soup'. However, I was annoyed by one 'impossible' gag in 'Jewish Prudence' during the courtroom sequence, when a solemn portrait of George Washington is seen to burst out laughing at Max's pathetic testimony. This sort of gag is acceptable for a totally unrealistic comedian such as Harpo Marx, but it drastically conflicts with the comedic style of Max Davidson, who tended to play very plausible and realistic characters. It's only due to fears of Political Incorrectness that Max Davidson's (Jewish) screen characterisation is so seldom available to modern filmgoers. I'll rate this very funny movie 10 out of 10."]},

However, due to his lack of talent, he faces constant rejection. Bhola's life takes an unexpected turn when he meets his look-alike, a wealthy businessman named Mannohar (also played by Kishore Kumar). Bhola decides to take advantage of this resemblance and takes on Mannohar's identity. He moves into Mannohar's lavish mansion and tries to navigate his new lifestyle while also pursuing his dream of becoming a singer. Along the way, he encounters various comedic situations and romantic entanglements.", "One of the highlights of \"Jhumroo\" is its music, composed by Kishore Kumar himself. The film features several popular songs, including the evergreen tracks \"Main Hoon Jhumroo\" and \"Koi Humdum Na Raha.\" Kishore Kumar's energetic and soulful renditions, combined with catchy melodies, add a lot of charm to the film. The music remains memorable even after all these years and is often remembered as one of the film's strongest aspects.", "The performances in \"Jhumroo\" are another standout feature. Kishore Kumar, who was not only a talented singer but also a versatile actor, delivers a stellar performance in dual roles. His comic timing and ability to switch between the characters of Bhola and Mannohar are commendable. Madhubala, known for her grace and beauty, complements Kishore Kumar's performance with her charm and screen presence.", "The film's direction by Shankar Mukherjee is competent, keeping the narrative engaging and lighthearted. The screenplay, although somewhat predictable, is well-paced and offers a good mix of comedy, romance, and drama. The dialogues are witty, contributing to the film's overall entertainment value.", "As with many movies from that era, \"Jhumroo\" has its fair share of melodrama and exaggerated comedic moments, which may not appeal to everyone's taste. However, it remains a delightful watch for fans of vintage Bollywood cinema, offering a glimpse into the golden era of Hindi musical films.", "Overall, \"Jhumroo\" is a classic Bollywood entertainer that showcases the talents of Kishore Kumar as an actor and a singer. With its memorable music, engaging performances, and light-hearted storyline, the film continues to be cherished by fans of Hindi cinema, making it a must-watch for lovers of vintage Bollywood movies."]},

I have never seen this make to the conversation when cinephiles talk about Oguri. Having no balance is what makes the charm of this Zainichi (Korean-in-Japan) Cinema. Do not fall into the trap of classic arthouse love story with long takes and just conversations from start to finish. This film is adapted from Lee Hwe-Song's 1975 novel of the same name, it follows two lovers, a second-generation Korean undergraduate SanjunIm and Kayako, a Japanese girl who is adopted by a Japanese mother and a Korean father. They get explore each others identity, heritage while telling stories as the landscape helps to accentuate this bleak drama. There are situations, past and borders that stops them from coming close, as the film moves there is more external and internal circumstances that is revealed. Oguri does not prescribe dramaturgy and does not overwhelm his story with pathos. Rather, he leaves his landscape, background score and the narration to do the talking.", "Coming to the music, there is a torrid outburst of agrression, it is captured breathtakngly with help of landscapes as subjects and with the amazing score composed by Kurodo Mori. There is much needed moment of serenity for the identity crisis that the film showcases. I was surprised with the score, it featured a Japanese Jailhouse rock. The subtlety of his choice is brilliant, without making much noise, but adds a more melodic and melancholic feel to the film, always carried by the sometimes warm, sometimes sorrowful.", "The boat scene when Kayako reveals her true identity, her actual name is Miwako (wait for the last scene) and gives a background about her past, the meaning of her name, a Korean harp. The scene towards the end when both down on the street trying to hear the sound of the water running underground is one of the best moments in the film. There is a reference to Keisuke Kinoshita's A Broken Drum (1949), i had seen it long back and still dislike the father character in the film.", "It will feel incomplete and mundane for many as it becomes as bleak as the weather throughout the runtime. But I would not recommend it to everyone, might be of interest to arthouse fans, will worth some time if you have it. You can add this along with legendary Kei Kumai's The Long Darkness (1972) as a double bill, i bet it will be bittersweet viewing."]},

She bears a striking resemblance to a young Monroe, but alas has a chipped front tooth and much larger breasts. It is sometimes hard for people to believe it is not Marilyn, for Miss Hunter does a great impersonation indeed. Not much is known about Arline Hunter except that she was a popular pin-up in the late 1940s through the early 1960s, always close to a dead ringer for Monroe. She recorded various B-films throughout the 1950s including \"Sex Kittens Go To College\" also starring Mamie Van Doren and others like \"The Angry Red Planet\" and \"Big Daddy\". Perhaps her biggest B-film was Ron Ormond's \"White Lightnin' Road\" in 1965.

His office made TV commercials and seemed to be a successful local animation studio of the 60s specialising also in film credits etc. This was their big cinema release for the 70s... and this epic cartoon had one of the first really wide print releases in the school holidays on about 25 screens in Sydney alone....an unusual event for the time. If you have seen the MGM fantasy style used in INVITATION TO THE DANCE (1956) with the Sinbad sequence, you can get a fairly accurate vision of the lush picture book style of Porter. Some fantasy scenes with the Princess of the piece in MARCO POLO are extremely well created and reflect a few lessons learned from Disney's FANTASIA. Sadly this strong entry into Australia's homegrown animated feature film history is not available on video or DVD. Several years ago I attempted to source the negative from Porter's widow who was thrilled to see renewed interest but alas the elements required to strike new prints were in disarray. The Film Archive in Canberra had the boxes and will eventually get around to a restoration via a deal they have with Kodak to restore 50 films held on site. The future looks good for this lovely animated film, one of the very few..if almost only feature length cartoons ever crated solely by Australians. It has a Gilbert and Sullivan feel about it..in fact there was an animated MIKADO years ago to which this also might owe a nod. It is also quite funny in a PUFNSTUF kind of way. If all those references mashed together sound hideous, let me assure you the end result is not. It's all quite zany and lovely. (Just like Australia)..ha ha.

The contrast between the smug, impeccably dressed and groomed executive in his Porsche and the needy homeless man is dramatic. Richman insults him and speeds away, running over his meager belongings. The following night, the tables have turned. Richman has been transformed, and is now reduced to the homeless man's level.

It deals with the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. We do not know if any of the readers of The Moving Picture World are of a sufficiently speculative nature to ask themselves what sort of place the world would be if everybody told the truth, on the truth were instantly discoverable. No doubt, in the present imperfect state of human nature, the world with nothing but the truth in it would be a very unpleasant place to live in; in fact, come to reason it out, it could not be done. Some years ago, W. S. Gilbert, the dramatist, handled this very theme. He wrote a fairy play called \"The Palace of Truth.\" All the characters in this play told the truth, and the result was that everybody was made uncommonly uncomfortable. Something like this idea has instigated the Gaumont film of \"Telltale Reflections.\" A piece of apparatus, called the hypnotic mirror, has the wonderful faculty of revealing past misdemeanors of persons in whose presence the mirror is uncovered. For example: A wretched burglar is brought before a magistrate. The mirror is uncovered, and in its surface we see reflected the actions of the burglar, who, being thus found out, is led away by a policeman. Then hubby comes home under suspicion by his wife, who, uncovering the mirror, sees re-enacted before her the Bacchanalian orgy in which her faithless spouse recently took part. So she gets real mad and smashes up the happy home. Next we are shown a schoolroom interior and the head master asleep. A pupil puts a fool's cap on his head and plays other jokes on the sleeping master, who, when he wakes, tracks down the real culprit by means of the hypnotic mirror. So it goes. As we have said, this is a whimsical idea, and it received applause for its whimsicality. Of course, being a Gaumont, it is an excellent photograph. - The Moving Picture World, November 20, 1909"]},

In it's worse moments, the movie comes on like a particularly overripe episode of DARK SHADOWS. The premise, concerning a deceased woman who possesses the body of a cousin, is rather weak and the film slips into weirdness near the end. The movie resorts to flying objects and mummified corpses to carry the last 30 or so minutes. The post-Civil War setting details are shakey; some of the dresses and hats the actresses wear look to be from a vintage some 20-40 years after the time of the setting. Still, there is some pretty scenery and some luxurious antebellum sets. Not high art, or even frightening, but clean and okay for passing an interminable Sunday afternoon."]},

The Chinese alphabet recited for part of it and echoed emphasizes the hopelessness of being trapped in a never-ending space. At the end, Frampton also teases the viewer and builds on this sense of hopelessness he seeks to create by exploring the cornfield and nearing the edge, but never quite reaching it as though lost. It's just as if one were to walk miles to stand under a cloud: no matter how far you go, you can never reach it.", "At thirty-five minutes this film seems overlong at least to me, and very much overly repetitive.

Collecting these images, he made \"Palindrome\", a self-reflective title which I have interpreted to be referencing the process used to create the short itself. (Simply put, if you look at the way the film was created, you see the same thing that is the movie). Unlike earlier efforts such as \"States\" and \"Heterodyne\", the film in this case relies almost entirely on the imagery itself, while the way it is displayed contributes to a certain extent to the abstraction but not enough to make it exceptionally better. The way the images consistently go through the pattern of long-flashes-long causes the audience to almost immediately feel the rhythmic pattern, while the second-long pauses between the pattern give the eyes a break from the successions preceding each.", "The visuals of \"Palindrome\" were made entirely from playing with the developing chemicals, yet it should not be underestimated as being entirely just a collection of these images. Using his remarkable editing skills, Frampton also takes the images and overlays them on top of one another--or superimposes them if you will. The amount of work taken to do all this physically was obviously a lot. Furthermore, the images are often repeated--admittedly overly so sometimes although this keeps the interest of the viewer--through not only being reused but also through having their exact photographic negative appearing as well as being presented upside down. In case one had not read the history, Frampton also hints at the film's title by the ending text, which reads \"et consvmimvr igni\"--a Latin palindrome which translates to \"and are consumed by fire\".", "The other reviewer of this short fails to see that to \"Palindrome\", there was no symbolical, nor analytical, intent behind the imagery. The presentation of the visuals and the psychedelic quality of them was meant to create an interesting abstraction, and not to be analyzed as having a certain meaning. With Frampton, symbolism in film was not so much his main interest, just visual look and nothing more. He set out to create interesting images and that is what this movie does; they are not meant to be anything except abstract dream visuals as they were not made with a photographic camera. Accept that that was the intent and do not frantically attempt an analysis, just enjoy the interesting imagery for what it is."]},

For thirty-two minutes, an unbearable amount of time for some expecting a true plot, the audience is given a series of directions on how to imagine their own experimental movie--involving themselves, their lovers, and Frampton himself as the main characters. Each shot is given in order, and much of what this mind-movie is is largely self-referential with its still photographs, cameras and whatnot. The movie that is \"Poetic Justice\" is not a single closeup of a cactus, a cup of coffee and a bunch of papers, it is actually whatever your mind does with the instructions it is given. You can judge this film based only upon how much you enjoy the imagery that your mind makes up in correspondence with the written screenplay, because the physical movie by the director is not meant to be entertaining or even judged as a movie. Of course, some might just use Frampton's script to create a true film with their own camera, but that would be entirely against the filmmaker's intent."]},

Both images are tackled from different perspectives including mirror images; in their repetitiveness, they create a sense of rhythm with the audience. According to Frampton, each was intended to be \"a physical demonstration of extreme internal stresses in equilibrium\". This may seem absurd on the outside, but that is only because we don't have the visions that Frampton had when he created the work. Though simplistic, it is an interesting film for me at least, though one only for true fans of experimental filmmaking."]},

The thirteen minute short takes very poorly preserved archive footage showing the events of November 22, 1963 when President John F. Kennedy rode through downtown Dallas, Texas with a parade, unknowingly bound to meet his gruesome fate, and adds clear audio of news reports describing a chaotic scene in Dallas after the president was shot. After about six to seven minutes of hearing this audio, we listen in on audio that gives us an idea of the events that preceded the horror, with reports talking about John and his wife Jackie Kennedy, their outfits, and the parade route, showing how everybody but one person knew what would happen to John F. Kennedy that day. \"Report\" is fascinating because through its technical imperfections (this is not a criticism) it creates a shivering account of that day, sure to strike the biggest cord with people who were alive when Kennedy was killed and remember where they were that faithful day. I was reminded of the feeling I get when I curiously search news reports of recent tragedies like the Aurora, Colorado theater shooting, the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, or even the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, or even simply recall where I was when I first heard about the events. When viewing things like this, it's almost as if your body goes into shock, unable to process all the emotions you're currently feeling. A deep feeling of sadness looms over you like storm-clouds rolling in. Even preparing for the downpour doesn't help much because it truly can't predict the real reaction and the real wave of sadness and disgust. Conner's \"Report\" is a beautifully made piece of film that inherently provides difficult emotions but a whirlwind of history up close.", "Directed by: Bruce Conner."]},

Oddest staging has over a dozen nude guys masturbating, waiting for a slim blonde to service them.", "Salieri adds a sense of class to the proceedings by taking great care over the settings and costuming, in addition to his expert lighting (a treat compared to the usual slapdash visuals of shot-on-video porn).

Like all successful filmmakers, however, he's bound to keep a skeleton or two in the closet (anyone remember James Cameron's Piranha 2: Flying Killers?). Ask him when he's in a cagey mood about his first film and he will wax lyrical about the ESP chiller Patrick (1977). Dig a little further and he may admit to a scandalous duet of  R-rated oddities, the first of which is the only full-frontal `Aussie Western', the 1976 period comedy The True Story Of Eskimo Nell.", "Max Gillies plays Deadeye Dick, peeping tom, foul-smelling bullsh*t artist, failed bushranger and all-round hopeless sack of sh*t. He teams up with champion d*ck-wrangler Mexico Pete (Serge Lazareff) after a disastrous liaison involving an irate husband, and together they go searching for Dick's sexual El-Dorado, the mythical first-rate whore and `Queen Whomper' named Eskimo Nell. They eventually come across `Nell' in a cheesy mountain hotel, and is hardly what Pete imagined, but Dick, lost in his one-eyed dreamworld, discovers the one glimmer of happiness his sad existence had denied him.", "The 1973 British sex comedy Eskimo Nell had already covered the making of a fictitious softcore version (as well as a gay western, kung fu and sickly family version!) of the famous bawdy 19th Century poem by a unscrupulous smut film producer. Franklin's version, co-written with Alan (Alvin Purple) Hopgood, sticks closer to the source material and transposes the action to a more culturally iconic stomping ground: the Ballarat Goldfields, the Eureka Stockade, the snow-capped Blue Mountains. The ambitious Franklin's second unit filmed the Klondike scenes - where Dick supposedly loses his eye - outside Montreal, and some incredible location shots such as the iceflows from the Canadian far north helped win the film an AFI award for Best Photography. Come to think of it, it's hard to remember when an R-rated film looked so good!", "Franklin's cast is first rate - Auntie Jack's Graham Bond briefly appears as Pete's potty-mouthed long lost mate `Boggo', and Lazareff as Mexico Pete is a soothingly familiar presence for those of us who fondly remember 70s Aussie TV. And Max Gillies, I hardly need to remind you, had his face plastered on TV every week in the 80s doing ear-tugging impersonations of Bob Hawke. During the 70s however he spent most of his career in bizarre comic film roles, and was no stranger to showing his pale underbelly - he had already played a lecherous married schlump doing a stoned striptease during the David Williamson segment of Libido (1973), so we didn't bat an eyelid over his most memorable scene in Eskimo Nell, starkers except for his ludicrously large hat, eye patch and strategically placed holster. Gillies spits out the smutty one-liners with relish, like `Have you ever stuck your d*ck in a milk pail and churned it till it's butter?' At the heart of the film, however, is the oddly touching parasitic relationship between voyeur Dick and coxman Pete, and their shared wet dream of finding the fictional lay Eskimo Nell.", "Seventies sex queen Abigail was a major selling point, gorgeous as ever and totally starkers (for the first and only time on film!) as Esmeralda the Leopard-clad wife of a traveling magician who catches Pete nailing her to the floor of his `Magic Box'. After leaving the warm bosom of the Number 96 TV series she had anticipated a career as an all-round entertainer. Despite a minor hit album and single `Je T'Aime' and traffic-stopping cameos in Alvin Purple (1973) and Alvin Rides Again (1974), her greatest talent appeared to be in self-promotion.", "In the rosy glow of hindsight we often forget, when looking back on the so-called liberated Seventies, that the spirit of puritanical oppression or `wowserism' more often than not reared its ugly head to spoil everyone's swinging good time.  Franklin even used the pseudonym `Richard Bruce', the filmmaker's way of hiding under a brown paper bag, on his second film, the hugely successful soft-porn portmanteau Fantasm (1976). In retrospect, his film career could have been over before it started."]},

Ending up fired from the show, Paradine calls his mother to complain and breaks down in hysterics, but by the next scene, he's back onstage, the incident never alluded to again until the end.", "The rest of the film stays the course as Paradine guides the contestants through a number of not terribly erotic \"games,\" including a glory hole penis guessing contest (the mystery member belongs to Marc Stevens, who figures heavily in the film's second half), a contest of sexual acrobatics (standing sex), and a concluding orgy that requires the constants get four different people off before the bell, with that fourth orgasm garnering the titular $50,000.", "Very little of this is sexy, because it's all smothered in Paradine's nonstop histrionics - even when the film slows down for a prolonged sex sequence, it's still stuck with his endless squalling over it. Beyond that, the eponymous \"game\" appears to have no discernable structure, with random people paired together with no rhyme or reason and all the \"contests\" essentially boiling down to \"have sex with each other,\" which makes any element of narrative or suspense a non-starter.", "Aside from Paradine's mugging, the other most bizarre element is an extended mid-film interview with Stevens, who sits in a chair pants-less for five minutes and hawks his new (and very real) autobiography, \"10 ½.\" Deliriously towing the line between a joke and a real ad, this segment stops the film cold (not that it was going anywhere anyway) but is absolutely fascinating nonetheless. (One wishes it were still so easy to run to the local bookshop and grab a copy of Marc's tell-all!) For what it's worth, Stevens - often as loathed as he is loved among vintage porn fans - generates what small charm I managed to find in the film, providing some able schtupping and a welcome bit of subdued comedy to counter Paradine's nonstop yowling.", "Less a porn movie than a psychotic off-Broadway performance inflicted on unwilling smut fans, there's very little out there like THE $50,000 CLIMAX SHOW. I have no idea who credited director \"James Wood\" is, but given Paradine's, Andre's, and notorious switch-hitter Stevens' presence in the cast, one suspects he might have been a member of the lavender set, if not one of those three themselves. Either way, the whole production smacks of \"gay guys making a straight porn flick,\" with its constant deference to high camp at the expense of sexual heat.

Pornographers notoriously pioneered in the now-commonplace mode of music theft and piracy, but putting their clammy hands on such a personal artistic achievement as this, recorded in the home Alice shared with John Coltrane, is unforgivable.

Here he's on his own, and has made the best within the limitations of this antiquated MOS (add narration) '60s approach to Sinema.", "I was a tad too young to have seen this film theatrically, and other than Russ Meyer at the end of the '60s I did not go to adult theaters as part of my budding career as a film buff, later industry professional, not until the hardcore era. I would have enjoyed this one, as its voice-over track is consistently interesting, not the usual mindless doggerel one associates with these ephemeral softporn outings that Mike at SWV has so studiously resuscitated for future generations.", "The firmly buxom Jackie Richards, of SHE CAME ON THE BUS and other contemporaneous assignments, stars and dominates the film as Kim, making it almost a \"one-girl\" operation. (In porn, one always dreaded being trapped in a film structured around just one actress, especially if she were found wanting in the first reel, looks-wise. That went double at a drive-in.) In what proves to be a rather complex narrative structure, almost worthy of exegesis by the growing number of self-proclaimed sexploitation film historians out there, she explains to her newly arrived sister Tina (actress uncredited, but believably cast as Jackie's sibling) what's happened to her since moving to the Big Apple.", "There are a very few on-camera dialogue scenes, with poor post-synch which makes it seem that Jackie has been dubbed by someone else, while the mystery actress portraying Tina appears to be doing her own lines. But the strength of the film is in Kim's well-written, at times almost erudite, narration. Flashbacks depict her relations with \"all my men\", told in the manner of a confessional and not dissimilar to various Wishman pictures of the period like BAD GIRLS GO TO HELL, or INDECENT DESIRES in which Richards also appeared. But writer-director Smith never goes over the top like his employer Doris was wont to do; I suspect he took his work more seriously than she did, judging by her disparaging remarks concerning her now surprisingly revered artifacts.", "Kim has a young benefactor in NYC who gives her a place to stay, but sex is the bartering chip. She almost immediately strays into prostitution, though self-consciously prefers to ask guys for money rather than cold-bloodedly charging them a rate, delusionally thinking of the payments as \"loans\". Her next John, who she alternately calls Jack or John (no it isn't JFK), is contacted through a Lonely Hearts Club, and he gets her involved in all manner of fetishism and S&M. Smith presents this very effectively, capturing the pain & pleasure gimmick of so many films of this period without turning off the viewer with excess -sort of S&M lite. Her role playing, dressing in black lace, and ultimately subjecting herself to the corny \"covered in whipped cream\" shtick so beloved by the Findlays and other pornmeisters of the '60s, is effective.", "Not so good is the weakest narration of the movie, where Smith has her declaring \"we're all whores\", indicating that men sell out for jobs and women for \"wifery\" (cute term, but stupid notion). This segment is saved by an explicitly Proustian (!!) scene where Kim communes with a shoe, becoming flooded with sense memories of her childhood and of having being raped (mentioned but not shown). It's outlandish but demonstrates how much narrative power & variety can be invented in post-production for these shot-silent epics.", "Format has Jackie constantly disrobing -the act of which is quite a sight for the fans, and eminently more erotic than the latterday \"all nude/all the time\" approach to porn. Her segment with a supposedly muscular non-stud Harvey is a waste, but her being introduced to the wonders of lesbianism by guest star Jo Ellen (of FELICIA fame) as Louise, recognizable sans credit by her trademark gamine short haircut, is far better. Film culminates with Tina introduced to \"all my men\" plus Louise at a spin-the-bottle party. The voice-over narration has also changed a bit, now posed as a sort of a farewell letter to Tina, more wistful and seemingly from a different starting point \"looking back\". The overall effect of narration switch reminded me of the same gimmick used in the telling of the current German film release THE WHITE RIBBON, although Smith plays fair with the audience (Kim is involved in ALL scenes) while so-called \"visionary director\" Michael Haneke cheats, having the narrator privy to numerous scenes he could not have possibly witnessed. Surprise ending is succinct, satisfying and logical.", "The entry point for this wild card of a film is exposure to a few dozen of the Wishmans', Findlays', Joe Mawra's and various anonymous NYC black & white masterpieces of the mid-'60s which eschewed direct sound. Once able to relate to this genre (not unlike the adaptation to appreciating silent films nearly 100 years after their heyday -a stumbling block that judging from IMDb vote counts has stymied 99.9% of today's audience), the pleasant elements of Smith's modest, unassuming ALL MY MEN are worth the expenditure of an hour in front of the LCD screen."]},

The sex scenes are terrible (though Candice's natural-looking big breasts offer brief voyeuristic appeal) and the humiliation and punishment absorbed by Christopher as MacGuffin and his unnamed male island supporting player are strictly puerile. Of the cast, Christopher reads his unintelligible lines by rote with zero emotion, while tooth-gapped Candice gives an eyes-bugging-out ham-bone performance. Even watching another of her videos (SECLUDED PASSION) over again for reference, I could not figure out if Dutches Von Stern was playing the brunette or if it was the equally and deservedly obscure Sandy Sunshine, of the 2 unidentified sisters."]},

This could be an intentional error to jokingly suggest that Kit has poor math skills.", "After the last credits roll, Kit's line, \"I saved the world!\tI saved it,\"\ncan be heard.", "The \"Deleted Scenes\" on the Blu-ray/DVD releases contain:\n", "Featured in ", " (1999)", "\"Bowfinger\" is one of the funniest movies I have seen in years.  It works because it allows the laughs to build from the way the characters play off each other's personalities, without becoming puppets of the script.  It is for people who love the movies as well, because that's what it's really about; how the movie industry works on such unlikely coincidences, and how the truly desperate are sometimes successful against their own natures.", "The movie is basically about a group of folks who want desperately to make a movie, to break into the big time.  They are led by Bobby Bowfinger, of \"Bowfinger International Productions\", a hack film \"studio\" in a ramshackle office in an L.A. suburb.  Bowfinger is the right man to head this team; he's unscrupulous, infinitely resourceful, and isn't daunted by the fact that his budget will come from the dollars he saved up each week since he was a kid, stashed in a box in his attic.  He collects his film crew from illegal immigrants trying to cross the border.", "His accountant has just written a script about aliens hiding in raindrops.  Don't ask, just watch the movie.  The movie is called \"Chubby Rain\".  Bowfinger wants Hollywood's leading action star, Kit Ramsey, to play the lead.  As Ramsey, Eddie Murphy turns out one of his best performances. Ramsey is wildly egotistical and emotionally unstable to a fault. He is a member of \"Mind Head\", one of those many Scientologist-like groups, where he goes often to discuss his many insecurities and paranoid fears, like that of, of course, aliens.", "Naturally, Ramsey refuses to be in the picture.  That doesn't stop Bowfinger.  He comes up with a clever, if risky, idea: follow Ramsey around, shoot him surreptitiously from a distance, using his own actors to play their parts with him, without Ramsey's knowledge.  This leads to many very funny scenes in which Ramsey comes to believe his paranoid fantasies about aliens are in fact real, while the actors in the movie praise Ramsey's \"style\".", "Eventually, a stunt double is needed for certain scenes, and a Ramsey look alike, named Jiff, is brought on board.  Jiff is an entirely unique character, played also by Murphy as a slow-witted innocent with a sheepish grin and a nasal voice.  He is lovable and yet annoying at the same time, to Murphy's credit, and a great movie character.", "I liked a lot of things about the movie, especially the eye it has for the way Hollywood works.  I really enjoyed a scene early on where Bowfinger stages a phony call with a car phone in a restaurant to create an opportunity to pitch his script to a high-powered executive played by Robert Downey, Jr.  Downey is surprised to see the cord dangling from Martin's phone; he may not take him seriously, but he's not likely to forget meeting him.", "I also liked the way Ramsey complains to his agent about not having a catch phrase the way white action stars have.  His agent points out a scene where he pushes a guy named Cliff off a cliff.  \"That's too cerebral for an audience,\" shouts Ramsey.  \"We're making a movie, not a film!\"  He points out that in the script he is reading, the letter \"k\" appears a number of times that is exactly divisible by three, so \"KKK\" appears \"486 times!\"", "What is best about the movie is the way Bowfinger goes for broke, improvising all the way.  He proceeds with a determination fueled by the insane notion that this scheme could actually work.  You have to respect the chutzpah of someone who wants to succeed that badly, even if he bends a few rules along the way."]},

While not awful, it fails to be nearly as good as other Snow films.

Think about it; we could just follow the escapades of John Glover's character.

Originally released as \"Rottweiler\" in 1982, you can see how the entire movie is relying on the fact that at some point they're gonna throw something towards the camera. As I watched it I thought after the first hour that I'd rented a movie called \"Mystery Dog\" because you never actually saw what was attacking these 80's act-bots (so amazing how they could manage to have such 2-dimensional actors in a 3D movie). And the dogs you eventually see look like your neighbor's dogs do when the kids tease it...hardly a fright. But it wasn't as though the film were a real disappointment as I hadn't expected much. The highlight of the movie for me was when the sherriff would shoot the dogs with his big ol' 44. You'd see the picture cut away from a snarling rottweiler to a cheap, paper machete casting of a rottweiler's head that would then explode throwing bologna, chocolate milk, stale beer and whatever else they decided would look like dog brains all over the place.

It did come up against heavy comparisons but is quite a different & better film. Whereas Truman was totally unaware that he was in a TV show Ed activity volunteers for the job. Such is the currency of celebrity in the modern media age. Who are you if you haven't been on TV?", "The world of celebrity is the one we inhabit in the early 21st century. They are used to try to convince us what to wear, what to eat, what to drink & even who to vote for! We are truly living in a  celebrity culture, with shows such as Big Brother & Survivor promoting the seemingly unstoppable desire by members of the public to become famous simply for being famous! Ed, slightly reluctant at first soon becomes seduced by this idea, an idea which turns sour.", "Ron Howards movie does have a lot to say about the issues of celebrity & reality TV, but at its heart is a great romantic comedy which has more of an edge to it than is expected from the one time star of Happy Days. The pairing of Matthew McConaughey & Woody Harrelson is inspired, they are great together sparking off one another. Natural comedic actors you believe they are brothers. Dennis Hopper puts in a good cameo & Jenny Elfman is totally convincing as the female romantic lead. You really care about the plight of the characters & the rest of the cast are also on top form. From Rob Reiners small role as a TV executive to the excellent Martin Landau as Eds father. He is one of the best character actors of recent years making truly varied & believable performance in films as diverse as Crimes & Misdemeanors, Ed Wood & Rounders. Add Edtv to the list -  his performance is comedy gold!", "\nThe great acting would of course all be in vain if it weren't coupled with a good script. Thankfully Edtv has one. All the predictable hallmarks of a romantic comedy are here but with a sharper wit & of course the reality show structure which brings a new dimension to the genre. Add to this Howards direction using all the tricks, styles & conventions of reality TV. Sometimes you are watching the cameramens POV, sometimes Eds exploits are conveyed on a TV screen complete with advertising, at other times you are presented with multiple viewpoints of the same scene. These constant variations in style keep the film fresh & interesting & are further enhanced by the audience reactions throughout the film & the TV led critique & discussions about the merits or otherwise of the phenomenon that is Edtv. Together the acting, directing & script really convince that Edtv is viable & could exist!", "Overall this is a funny, well directed romantic comedy from Ron Howard. Great performances abound from all concerned. There is a deeper level to the film which isn't hammered home or done in a heavy handed way but is there none the less among the laughs.

I guess the story\nwas the least concern from the makers, the idea was to use the plot as background for the countless sex scenes involving Imara and her clients - and there's\nplenty of those moments while Caique's character only has one sexual scene that comes at the film's final minutes.

Trust me, you can skip this one without regrets\ncause there's nothing worth seeing. I jumped on board just to see a familiar name and face from the 1980's of whom I never got the chance to see before\nsince he died at an early age and didn't have many works available to see which is the young Caique Ferreira. Sadly, this film doesn't provide much of\na chance for him to present himself as a good actor. His character has some good moments - when he saves the girl from the cop who tries to rape her -\nbut overall it's just a low-life character who went from nowhere, grew up to become important but he'll always be stuck in this same lousy life condition\nbeing a shadow to the intelligent prostitute. 2/10."]},

On the whole I've been repeatedly impressed with Pixar's animated shorts (perhaps even more so than many of their feature films!), and 'Geri's Game', in which an elderly man enjoys a game of chess with himself, may just be the best I've seen - even amongst such a tight array of gems as 'Knick Knack', 'For the Birds', and the ingeniously simple 'Luxo Jr', there's something about this one that really stands out above the rest. It's breezy and colourful, and the animation is simply excellent - I know that until relatively recently, people have always considered human character designs to have been the weak link in Pixar's digital portfolio (check 'Tin Toy' for example, and contrast the ultra-shiny, believable Tinny with his somewhat chunky human baby nemesis). Well, there's nothing in the least bit awkward or artificial about our title character Geri - he's a very polished creation indeed, with facial expressions all smoothly on target (can't go wrong when you're using Jonathon Harris as your model).", "This is of course the very same Geri who showed up soon after as the cleaner in 'Toy Story 2' (I'm not sure if he was actually referred to by name, but he was there, and he even flaunts his trademark chess pieces at one point). I was always intrigued by this mysterious character, and when I discovered that he had a short film of his own I was anxious to see it (too bad it's been regulated to the 'Bug's Life' DVD, which is actually my LEAST favourite Pixar feature - there's irony for you). I finally managed to capture this little diamond on Pixar's own official website and, needless to say, it didn't disappoint.", "The quality animation aside, and with the European plaza-style music setting it off to a nifty pulse, it's the slick editing that really makes this concept come alive. Seriously, it's amazing. I'm sure this has been pointed out enough times already, but no matter how obvious Pixar make it that really this is little more than just a bored and lonely old man making the most of his chess set and his seclusion, the way in which it cuts seamlessly between the players on each side of the table will quickly have you believing otherwise. Two very distinctive characters really do appear to emerge from one (think something along the lines of Gollum's personal tête-à-têtes in 'Lord of the Rings', only a lot less sinister in this case).", "Unlike other Pixar shorts, including 'Knick Knack' and 'For the Birds', 'Geri's Game' may not be a laugh-riot exactly, but then laugh-out-loud hilarity has never been the essential ingredient for class entertainment. What makes this film so engaging is its intelligent story, gentle humour and truly charming sense of character. The cool visuals are a delightful bonus.", "Grade: A+ - Clearly, playing a game of chess on your own can be more enthralling than you'd think."]},

The narration starts off with a routine introduction, with Morrison sounding a bit bored, as the Zeppelin comes in to the mooring dock; then  unexpectedly  \"it burst into flames! Get out of the way! Get out of the way! Get this, Charlie; Get this, Charlie!\" At this point, the 31-year-old Chicago reporter (on assignment from WLS radio station) thought of nothing but capturing the moment for all prosperity, in the process immortalising himself and making the Hindenburg disaster one of the most recognisable air disasters in history. Though Morrison's on-the-scene commentary has become inseparable from the newsreel images of the Hindenburg's fate, the images and audio were recorded entirely separately, and were not synchronised until many years later; most newsreels of the day accompanied the footage with over-dramatic title cards or studio-recorded narration.", "After watching 'The Zeppelin Hindenburg (1936),' a rare compilation of amateur footage that covers one of the airship's successful trans-Atlantic crossings, I was prompted to seek out the more exciting footage that has burnt itself into history. Since there are many newsreels of the disaster to be found on the internet, I watched a brief selection: 'Hindenburg Explodes (1937),' filmed by Pathé cameramen; 'Hindenburg Explodes, Scores Dead (1937),' released by Universal Newsreels (even though their cameraman wasn't present at the incident) and two alternative clips with Morrison's commentary dubbed over the footage. In one of the clips, Morrison's voice is surprisingly high, suggesting incredible panic and anxiety, though this can likely be attributed to the footage being recorded at a slower frame-rate, meaning that playback has been misleadingly sped up. Engineer Charlie Nielsen also played a crucial role in capturing the incident, lowering the cutting head back to the recording disc after it was dislodged by the shockwave from the explosion. In total, 36 people lost their lives in the disaster  and Charlie got it, all right!"]},

He seems to believe that he just needs to swagger and mumble to look cool and he is sadly mistaken.  He just looks like a stereotype which I suppose he is - everything about his bling-bling lifestyle is just one big cliché that he brings nothing new to.  Johnson is a little better because he makes fun of himself more than P does but even this is lazy swearing and mugging stuff.

I guess they do have to hand crank the camera but construction workers are really coordinated. They do obviously film from some rooftops or high windows to get the high vantage point. It's not the same thing. The construction of each film frame looks very artistic. This looks really good. I just need the high beam walk for it to be perfect."]},

Alanis Morrissette- Considerably younger than the other \"classic\" artists on the bill, but undeniably talented. Even some of us older fans can enjoy her. It remains to be seen if she'll have enough diversity in her style to sustain her early enormous popularity over a full career. (Presently her second album isn't quite making the noise the first one did.)", "2. Bob Dylan- He continues to amaze his fans with his musical vitality after over 35 years of professionally performing. He constantly reinvents his old music and chooses freely and abundantly from his enormous repertoire, which just so happens to be the best of any living songwriter. Still, many will dismiss him saying, \"I don't like his voice.\" His usual band of the time (John Jackson, Tony Garnier, Winston Watson, Bucky Baxter) is here augmented by Ron Wood and Al Kooper. All songs are performed well; I especially liked \"Leopard Skin Pillbox Hat\" and \"Silvio.\"", "3. Quadrophenia- This wasn't billed as a performance by the Who despite the participation of Messers. Daltrey, Entwistle and Townshend. This semi-theatrical presentation sounded amazingly fresh, a bit of a surprise to me. Townshend took it easy as he's done in more recent years, playing acoustic guitar, but his solo turn was warmly appreciated. Entwistle was as dexerous as ever. Daltrey was in fine voice throughout. At one point near the end with his head bowed he looked about 25 years old.", "4. Eric Clapton- It pains me to say it, but Eric has hardly done anything that has interested me since Derek & the Dominos. Even now that he's playing more blues and displaying more virtuosity, it just seems like an empty use of his talent. He tosses out a million notes on \"Have You Ever Loved a Woman\" but he's done that song better countless times in the past. The audience goes crazy over \"Badge,\" not noticing or caring what an ordinary, mediocre song it is."]},

Wrong! \"The Mummy and the Curse of the Jackals\" easily outdistances any Ed Wood or Herschell Gordon Lewis film in the bad movie stakes. The only competition it might have is from some of those wretched Andy Milligan productions. I ran across a copy of \"The Mummy...\" a few years back and snatched it up eagerly; it starred Anthony Eisley and John Carradine, had a goofy title, and was reputed to be one of the absolute worst movies ever. It had to be fun, right? Not exactly. First of all, the story makes no sense whatsoever, not even by el cheapo monster flick standards. As another reviewer has pointed out, Anthony Eisley commented that the film was unfinished as far as he knew--so it's possible that something more coherent was intended, but never achieved. At any rate, don't get frustrated when you watch it; it's total nonsense. Secondly, Eisley doesn't even look like he's having fun (which is odd for him). He wears a tense, incredulous look throughout the movie, as if he's thinking, \"What the hell am I doing here?\" Finally, John Carradine's contribution is minimal. I'm guessing that there were supposed to be more scenes with him and the cop...but, again, the film was never finished. There are a few interesting bits: the spooky, enigmatic face of Marliza Pons; the hilarious scenes featuring the Mummy and the \"Jackal Man\" rampaging through Las Vegas; and, of course, the amazingly catchy theme music. (Was it recorded specifically for the film, or was it just library music? It sounds a bit dated for 1969.) Unfortunately, none of these things makes up for the fact that this is a dull, wearisome film. I pulled \"The Mummy and the Curse of the Jackals\" out again the other night and actually watched the entire thing, but not without difficulty. It's one of those semi-legendary baddies that you go to a lot of trouble to track down...but when it's over you say, \"What a waste!\" Too bad. (RIP John Carradine and Anthony Eisley.)"]},

Unfortunately, most of the scenes are shallow and overly long. I discovered that early on. There is practically no plot or trail of events... everything just blends into a bland display. The music is okay but gets repetitive. The black and white imagery and comparison of shadows and people are provoking concepts but do not develop into anything significant. After the first 10 minutes or so, I entered a phase where I wasn't really paying attention to the content, although though I was still attempting to decipher any meaning of the film. A couple scenes caught my eye, such as a cutout being covered by beach sand and the first couple scenes with real people, but most of the content was forgettable. I considered leaving, but figured I would give the film a chance for redemption. The final part gives a little bit of satisfaction because it wraps up the ideas nicely.", "To its credit, New York Eye and Ear Control is reasonably successful as being a piece of art. It has an interesting message about human behavior and personality overall, but many of the individual scenes are artificial and bland. It leaves you with a deep impression, whether good or bad. But that doesn't make it a good film. It was a boring, slow, plot less, and tasteless presentation. Avoid this film unless your a die-hard art admirer or have infinite patience."]},

This film is often mistaken for a Giallo, but I knew it wasn't before I began watching it, so no disappointment there. All I really wanted from this film was an erotic extravaganza similar to the other two Amandio films that I'd seen, and when I looked at the plot description; it seemed as though I was going to get one. The plot focuses on a relationship between a daughter and her father's wife to be. This relationship is ripe for heinous sexual activity, and when you throw the daughter's 'not too clever, but sexually efficient' boyfriend into the mix; you know there's going to be a lot of nude scenes. Silvio Amandio obviously enjoys filming lesbian scenes, and may even be a bit of a pervert as all three films that I've seen from him have an astute lesbian angle...and that's certainly no bad thing. Anyway, the main plot focuses on the idea of the daughter trying to rid herself of her future step mother.", "I've got to say that I absolutely loved the style of the film. It feels very seventies, and the central location; a beach setting looks gorgeous with its golden sand and crystal clear waters. It also provides the film with a distinct fantasy style, which might have gone well with the sex themes if they were more well done. The lead women are both your typically sexy Italians, but their scenes together aren't very tender and feel a little too rehearsed; strange coming from a man who shot possibly the best lesbian scene ever filmed in Amuck. Gloria Guida spends a lot of the film with little or no clothes on, which is nice as she has a great body; while Italian horror star Dagmar Lassander provides the film with a suitably sexy older woman performance. The plot isn't very deep, and it's clearly more of a premise for Amandio to shoot sex scenes from. This isn't a big problem; however, as the film is mostly interesting all the way through and while there's no violence or gore, the central character does impose a rather vicious screen presence. It's easy to feel sorry for Dagmar Lassander's character by the end, although the ending itself left me rather cold. Overall, I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to find this film; but it's certainly not bad."]},

The nephew changes the name to the Hotel Rainbow and overbooks with royalty, assassins, secret agents, Japanese tourists, and munchkins (from the cast of ", "). Secret Service agent Bruce Thorpe and casting director Annie Clark find romance amidst the intrigue and confusion.", "It is 1938 and the USA is still gripped by the Great Depression. A corrugated iron barn surrounded by mud and puddles, in the middle of a fallow field somewhere in Kansas, is serving as a refuge and hostel for a community of the destitute, homeless and unemployed, as well as a post office and bus station.", "Diminutive dwarf Rollo Sweet (Cork Hubbert) enters the barn, goes to the post office grille and asks the Mail Clerk (Bill Lytle) whether anything came for him. Nothing. The man pours cold water on his hopes and dreams of an offer of a job from the Hollywood movie studios. He says if he doesn't get an offer with bus fare to California, he'll mail himself there if he has to. A crowd of other residents crowds around a skeletal wireless receiver, which has its metal chassis with the glowing vacuum tubes naked on the shelf where it sits. It needs a long wire strung all the way up onto the barn roof as an antenna if it is to receive the broadcast from the radio station. Just then, the announcer introduces a broadcast by the President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, but suddenly the sound degrades into noise, and Rollo volunteers to go outside and fix the aerial which he says will have been knocked by the sign falling in the wind. Outside, the little man clambers up on a pile of rubbish to the porch and is stretching up to lash the aerial wire back onto the edge of the corrugated iron roof when the bus arrives and in his excitement he looks round, loses his footing, and tumbles down off the roof landing on the teetering pile of old furniture, motor tires, and dusty junk.", "The voice on the radio, however, has been restored. It speaks of Hitler's invasion of Germany's neighbor Austria and just then we are shown the Führer (Theodore Lehmann) who is instructing his diminutive but aggressive secret agent Otto Kriegling (Billy Barty, doing a theatrically strong German accent) on his latest mission. Otto is to go to California, to a certain hotel, to meet up with an agent of the Emperor from Tokyo, whom he will recognize because he will be Japanese and wearing a white suit. The latter will recognize Otto because of his height --- he is 3 feet 9 inches tall. In addition, the Japanese agent will use as a secret password the unusual statement \"The pearl is in the river\", which will prove he is the man to whom Otto must hand over a secret map of America's military defense system. Otto departs, confident that nothing can go wrong with these arrangements.", "The scene switches to the movie studios right across the street from that very hotel, where Annie Clark (Carrie Fisher) is being shown a matte painting of a huge mansion, a money saving photographic effect supposedly being used in 'Gone With The Wind' which is close to completion, by her boss Louie (Jack Kruschen). Louie then tells her she has to look after 150 diminutive actors and extras who are about to arrive in town on Sunday from all over the world, to play the Munchkins in 'The Wizard of Oz', of which scenes involving them are about to start shooting the following day (the Monday). She is also instructed to make use of the services as her assistant of the boss's very tall nephew Homer (Peter Isacksen), an evidently slightly slow-witted young man who thereafter follows her about for a while. She must also find \"a funny dog\" (to play Dorothy's dog Toto).", "The scene changes again to the New York city quayside, where a passenger liner from Europe has just docked. Bruce Thorpe (Chevy Chase) is there to meet an Austrian royal duke (Joseph Maher) who has, since the ship sailed from England, enjoyed the protection of Inspector Collins (Anthony Gordon) of Scotland Yard. Thorpe is with the US government Secret Service and is to continue personal protection for the Duke and Duchess (Eve Arden). He shows his badge to the ship's officer on the gangplank and gets aboard to meet his charges. A sinister looking man following him is turned back. A considerable number of very small people are going ashore from the liner and heading for the same transcontinental railway station.", "Typical for an American, Thorpe has no idea of the correct form of address for European aristocracy, and ranges through a variety of forms without ever lighting upon \"Your Grace\", the correct way to address a Duke. He quickly discovers that the Duke lives in permanent dread of assassination, although Thorpe tries to assure him that the likelihood of it happening in America is slight. To prevent it, the Duke continually dons a series of childish disguises such as spectacles attached to a false nose and mustache. His other preoccupation in life is preserving his wife's companion, a dog which she calls \"Strudl\". But Strudl is forever coming to grief in one way or another. Fortunately the Duchess has extremely poor eyesight, but refuses to wear her spectacles, so that she believes that almost any dog of roughly the right size and coloring is her beloved pet. The Duke tells Thorpe that a dozen of these animals have already died in one way or another without her noticing, the first by assassination: the Duke's father fell on the dog and killed it when he was assassinated.", "On the train across America, we catch sight of the sinister man, the Assassin (Robert Donner), but he never gets a shot at the Duke. However the dog Strudl is accidentally shot by the Duke when he shows Thorpe his own pistol, and Thorpe has to help the Duke find a replacement. They achieve this by bribing the conductor to leave them alone in the baggage car, where they find an unattended item of live canine cargo and rush back to the Duchess with the poor pooch, to assure her that her pet is still alive and well. As they leave the baggage car, Rollo cuts his way out of a mail bag with a pocket knife ready to escape from the train at its destination. All make it across the continent and duly alight in Los Angeles.", "At the Hollywood train station, Annie Clark is at the station to meet some of her diminutive charges as they get off the train. She bumps into Bruce Thorpe in the huge shady station building and her good looks get his attention... for a moment.", "Rollo runs from the Los Angeles railway terminus with a ticket collector in pursuit, but hides himself among other small people, and gladly joins them when invited to get his first job in movies playing a Munchkin with them.", "Thorpe has booked the entire top floor of the Culver Hotel, which he thinks will be quiet and thus a safe retreat for his aristocratic charges. We are now taken inside the foyer of the Hotel, where the Telephone Operator Miss Enwright (Louisa Moritz) is taking a call from Homer across the street at the movie studios. Homer wants to book accommodation for 150 small people at the hotel. The girl writes this down, but then has her head turned by her boss, Lester Hudson (Richard Stahl), who invites her away for a trip with him to a hotel managers' convention (a likely story). This trip has the double effect first, of turning her head so much that she completely forgets to book the 150 small guests, and second, of leaving the hotel in the hands of the boss's incompetent nephew Henry Hudson (Adam Arkin) to whom he makes cleared he will be not only fired but disinherited if he screws up the job of minding the hotel while he is away. Henry, thinking he has an almost empty hotel to manage and that he must impress his uncle by filling it with guests, now has a banner strung across the front of the building renaming it \"The Hotel Rainbow.\" He has a very limited staff at his disposal: a very elderly man dressed as a bell boy, a negro elevator operator called Otis (Freeman King), and a very tall house detective called Tiny (the 6ft 7in Pat McCormick) who has a brown bowler hat and a drinking problem.", "Agent Bruce Thorpe arrives with the Duke and Duchess, and the dog, and they move into the top floor. Meanwhile an entire busload of Japanese gentlemen tourists arrive, all wearing white suits, and temporary manager Henry Hudson welcomes them to the hotel, still unaware of the imminent Munchkin contingent. (The bus has on its side the legend \"JAPS -- the Japanese Amateur Photography Society\".)", "Agent Otto Kriegling now arrives and strides into the hotel. He immediately realizes he has a problem: he is appalled to see twenty Japanese men in white suits, has no idea which of them is his oriental contact, and says at once, very loudly, \"The pearl is in the river\". However, after glancing round at him the tourists ignore this and return to taking photos of everything in sight in the hotel foyer, including the mail box and the postcards in the rack at the desk and a tire that fell off a bus.", "At this moment the Munchkin contingent arrives outside, heads in through the doors, along with Annie Clark and Homer, so that it dawns on Henry that he doesn't have enough room for all these small people as well as for the two dozen Japanese men in white suits so long as the top floor is taken by just three people. Now Annie begs Bruce to let some of her little people use top floor rooms; but he declines, trying to be both suave and authoritative, chivalrous but firm, believing that the Duke's safety depends on isolation.", "Otto is quickly caught up among the little people in the hotel foyer. The real Japanese secret agent Nakomuri (Mako) now arrives and immediately realizes that he has a problem: he has no idea which of the many dozen little people in and around the hotel is his Nazi contact.", "Day moves to night, and the hotel restaurant is full of oriental men in white suits, and little people, all having dinner. One Japanese tourist who speaks English has made friends with Annie and borrowed a Wizard of Oz script, which is on his table in front of him to read while he has his dinner. At the next table sit the Duke and Duchess, and the dog Strudl, which is enjoying a plate of paté de foie gras. The assassin lurks in a corner. Otto scans the room for a clue as to which Japanese is his contact. Something startles the Duchess and a large pearl comes loose from her antique necklace and, thrown through the air, lands in the dog's food. The helpful tourist looks up from Annie's script, notices the Duchess in distress at losing her pearl, and says loudly \"The pearl is in the liver\" ... except that, with the stereotypical Japanese phonetic error, he says not \"liver\" but \"river\" and this is clearly heard not only by the Duchess (who retrieves her pearl) but by Otto who assumes he has found his contact and, going over to the tourist's table, slips the military map between the pages of the Wizard of Oz script, which is then given back to Annie.", "Still in the dining room, the assassin attempts to shoot the Duke but instead kills the tourist who read Annie's script. During the evening, a couple more of the Duchess's dogs are killed by one means or another and the Duke and Bruce Thorpe replace them at the local pet store. Bruce comments that the latest one had better not be killed because the store only has sheep left --- the Duchess's eyesight is evidently not quite that bad.", "The little people go off across the road to get Munchkin costumes and makeup done overnight, ready for an early start shooting Wizard of Oz scenes, but when they return all ready, of course they cannot go to bed in costume and makeup, so they stay up, get drunk, and then run riot in the hotel. There are many sight gags of what the little people are getting up to in the kitchens, in the hotel foyer, around its staircase, balcony, chandelier, and tormenting the already distraught Henry Hudson.", "Otto and Nakomuri finally meet, and realize the map is in unaware Annie's possession so they go after her. Then Homer sees Otto and carries him bodily off to the studio costume and makeup shop from where he returns dressed and bewigged like the other small people. He takes up his pursuit of Annie, searches her room without finding the map, then corners her in the hotel kitchen but is taken on by Rollo, all in his own Munchkin costume which just happens to be identical to Otto's.", "Annie gets shut in the walk-in freezer room. Bruce comes to rescue her but lets the door shut so they are both trapped, and they cuddle up to keep warm -- the beginning of romance. Bruce sees two dead Japanese men in white suits hanging with the meat. Rollo lets Bruce and Annie out, and the fight goes on as Rollo rouses all the Munchkins to help pursue Otto.", "Finally Otto and Nakomuri corner Annie, Bruce, the Duke and the Duchess in the vacant hotel barber shop, but then the Assassin has also caught up with the Duke at last. He explains that his father tried to assassinate the Duke's father at the outbreak of the First World War, but that he missed the bus, so it has been his own life's destiny to avenge his father's failure and assassinate the present Duke instead. However, as he produces his gun, Nakomuri points his own special lethal camera at the Assassin and the two shoot each other dead.", "Otto is now alone. He throws the dog out as a distraction, and points his sword at Annie's throat demanding to have the map, whereupon Bruce tells Otto that the map is hidden in a locket on the Duchess's dog's collar. As day breaks, Otto runs out of the hotel front door after the dog, which runs across the sunny street onto the movie studio lot where it, Otto, and the pursuing crowd of Munchkin actors disrupt sound stages shooting scenes for a western, Gone With The Wind (Otto joins the dog under Scarlett's crinoline and an off-camera Clark Gable tells the director he should keep it in the picture), then Otto gets the locket and tries to get away in a vintage bus, and Rollo chases him with a horse-drawn carriage, which ends with both of them crashing into a building.", "Just then, Rollo wakes up... back in the barn in Kansas. We finally get a proper look at the other people in the corrugated iron barn hostel in Kansas, and notice that among them are the faces of Bruce and Annie (Bruce is really a talent agent and Annie is a local nurse, who are engaged to be married), the Duke and Duchess (the Duke is really the owner of the hostel and the Dutchess is his wife who works as the cook), and the Assassin (who is a resident), plus Tiny (who is Rollo's handyman co-worker). Homer, Henry Hudson, and Nakomuri are all residents. We quickly realize that this whole story has been Rollo's dream after injuring his head from the fall off the barn at the beginning of the film... rather as his personal dream adventure just as the Yellow Brick Road and the Land of Oz was Dorothy's dream, with its characters wearing the faces of people she knew. And it seems an offer of work in movies has finally arrived for Rollo, and all his friends at the hostel wish him well, as they put him on yet another bus that pulls up then and is headed west for Hollywood. It is full of little people and, when the door opens, a bald little man welcomes Rollo aboard and introduces himself as an actors' agent for little people who will look after him. Rollo recognizes his face; it's that of Otto Kriegling... but the voice is American, not German. Rollo and his friends then head out for Hollywood."]},

Anyway, the widow becomes involved with a friend of her late husband's (Philip Leroy), hoping he will straighten out her daughter. But she ends up instead trying to straighten HIM out instead as they drink J and B whiskey in her room.", "Brochard was a French beauty who toiled for may years in Italian exploitation films (kind of a less successful version of Edwige Fenech). Virgili was apparently a showgirl and nude centerfold. Since the \"mother\" here was probably in her early to mid thirties and the \"daughter\" maybe twenty, they're not exactly very believable in these roles, but that's par for the course for movies like this (there both smoking-ass hot, which was no doubt the primary concern). This movie cannot be taken entirely seriously (it's definitely a male fantasy on some level), but it's not a completely ridiculous porn scenario either. It's actually a little lacking in sex (although it has way too much disco dancing), and it manages to turn into a fourth-rate version of \"The French Connection\" by the end.", "Amazingly, this movie just got a legitimate subtitled release in America from the same company that recently released a Gloria Guida flick (the Italian actress who basically invented the promiscuous teenager role Virgili plays here), an Italian \"Exorcist\" rip-off flick (\"Ring of Darkness\"), a \"scholastic\" Italian sex comedy (\"Desirable Teacher\") and several of the other kinds of 70's Italian-made exploitation trash that has so rotted my mind and shredded my sanity over the years. This film is not anywhere near the class of something like \"The Seduction\" or \"Malizia\", but it's probably a lot easier to find right now if you just want to experience some 150-proof Italian exploitation swill."]},

Anyhow, the picture turned out to be a surprisingly engaging romp; its major inspiration is to turn the sexual exploits of a well-endowed male teenager into black comedy material, as his 'talent' elevates the fortunes of a run-down seaside hotel owned by his liberal grandmother! As the film opens, the boy (Christian Borromeo) is shy and two of his pals decide to take him to an aging and unattractive local prostitute  but she balks at the size of his member, arguing that it could ruin her own professional tool! Back home, he's infatuated with the voluptuous maid  though, when she finally calls him into her room one night, they're immediately interrupted by his father (who lusts after the girl himself when his own spouse is asleep!).", "The hero is sent to his grandmother's as punishment; he's not initially looking forward to the prospect, but some time after his arrival he meets the daughter (future Italian TV showgirl Lory del Santo) of the architect engaged to carry out the renovation of the hotel. She appears snobbish at first but, during dinner, their mutual attraction is palpable  leading to some below-the-table shenanigans which distract a woman sitting at a nearby table from her full-time job of secretary to a pompous TV writer (unable to contain her passion, she too eventually confronts the boy in the hotel corridors). Aiding the hero in the maintenance of the hotel is another male youth: however, he has no such luck with the women despite being hung-up on one particular guest  Ajita Wilson, a black transsexual quite popular during this time (whose on-screen husband is himself gay).", "Anyway, satisfied customers start spreading the word and soon the place is buzzing with activity (most of it, naturally, centering around Borromeo's quarters). Two extraneous conquests for the boy are the very girl who put him on the road to 'success' i.e. the maid from his former household who decides to pay him a visit on her day off and the sister of the hotel owner's lawyer who, married to a rich but senile foreigner, is obviously left wanting in certain matters. By the way, Borromeo's granny had forbidden him to become involved with the female hotel staff  but these two girls won't be discriminated against, and decide to quit in unison unless...", "To cut a long story short, the boy's virtually non-stop occupation soon takes its toll and his sexual prowess is ultimately dissipated; this, of course, could spell disaster for the hotel  but, thankfully, del Santo is back and she manages to cure Borromeo. The film is breezy fun for the most part, what with its likable protagonist and many of the younger girls obviously looking great unclothed; on the opposite end of the scale, Wilson definitely emerges an acquired taste (this is the second film I've watched her in following Jess Franco's MACUMBA SEXUAL [1981], though the same director's SADOMANIA [1981] and Cesare Canevari's THE NUDE PRINCESS [1976] could be worth pursuing as well)  while Stelvio Cipriani's cheesy score can hardly be ranked among his more notable efforts."]},

I must give credit where credit's due, though. The film has a nice visual appeal to it. I liked the cinematography, I liked the wild color schemes, I liked the costume designs. But without good acting, a film has no redeeming value. I'd rather watch a film with little visual appeal, with good actors and sharp dialogue (i.e.: \"The Brothers McMullen\" or any Edward Burns film). The actors either recite their dialogue in monotones or scream it out like they're in a bad soap opera. This is why I don't badmouth most mainstream actors. Let's face it, most actors who are mainstream are mainstream for a reason. If they're not \"great\" actors, they're at least competent. People badmouth Leo DiCaprio, but when was the last time you saw a movie where he recites the dialogue as if he's reading it off the page? It's a shame, because the director seems like he knows his stuff when it comes to mis en scene (sp). At the same time I can't totally praise Steve Balderson (the director). He did write the screenplay, which contains some horrible dialogue. He might be slightly racist too, since there's a black principal in the movie, who inhabits a culmination of African-American stereotypes."]},

No sooner does he locate the map than the ski-mask thugs break into his house and demand it, having apparently taken seven years to accomplish the rather simple task of finding the dead guy's address and/or family.

Rowsdower happens to know a lot about the thugs (a cult bent on world domination, we are informed), having been one of their number some years back.

BUT WAIT!  Troy goes off in search for water, and in his random trek comes across a distinct rock formation.  The rock formation is on the map!  Rowsdower's truck must have read the script, since it conveniently broke down within an easy walking distance of one of the map's landmarks.  There's also a tunnel with a copy of the map painted on one of the walls (why don't the cultists just look there?), and a translation guide belonging to Troy's father (which has held up pretty well despite seven years in a damp tunnel).  But they can't stay to linger, since the cult has finally caught up with them, so it's off to another chase sequence.", "Zap and Troy hide out in a weathered cabin, elluding the cultists and ending the chase.  BUT WAIT!  The owner of the cabin is none other than Troy's dad's old partner Mike Pipper, hiding in the wilderness from the cult these seven years (cue dramatic music).  Pipper looks like a very seedy Jim Henson, and talks like a cross between Yosemite Sam and (speaking of Henson) the \"News Flash\" guy from the Muppet Show.  He also provides more backstory on the cult, who are survivors of a race called the Ziox.  Apparently the Ziox started worshipping an evil idol and were punished by having their city sink into the earth, proving that the Ziox have read up on \"Great Flood\" archetypes and the myth of Atlantis.  Satoris wants to sacrifice someone to the idol in order to become invincible, despite Pipper's assertion that the idol isn't located where the map says it is.  Pipper also drops a warning in Troy's ear about Zap: \"He was with Satoris the night your father was killed.\"  Troy's so shocked he doesn't even bother to ask how Pipper knows this, since a) all the cultists wear ski masks and b) nobody else was around when it happened.", "So, somehow Satoris manages to kidnap Troy and take him to the location of the lost city--proving that he did not need the map at all, despite breaking in Troy's door earlier--where the idol waits, having eluded Pipper's searches.  (I'm guessing Satoris carts the idol around with him, keeping it in a storage locker in between rituals)  Rowsdower pursues, there's a fight, Satoris is killed (don't ask me how) and the Ziox city pops up out of the ground.  And all ends well, except for Troy's aunt and caretaker who didn't know about any of this and had a heart attack when she came home to find her house trashed and her nephew missing.  Well, maybe not.  But it could have happened.", "One final note: This film was made in Canada, but I cannot bring myself to ridicule my neighbors to the north because of it.

In order to get time off, Mandel offers to testify against his former partner and best friend Krieger (Matthias Redlhammer). Retired Cop Schimanski (Götz George), now living on a houseboat in Belgium, is asked to transport Mandel across the border to Germany and hand him over to the authorities there. Schimanski agrees reluctantly, but the pair – snobbish Mandel and proletarian Schimanski, who once attempted to book Mandel – make uneven travel-companions. The journey is interrupted when a pair of Romanian hit men tries to kill Mandel. Now tied together by handcuffs, Schimanski and Mandel have to find their way to safety via car, train or on foot.", "\"Blutsbrüder\" (eng: \"Blood Brothers\") is easily one of the more interesting episodes of the new Schimanski-series. It is of course the old \"good-cop / bad-guy, tied together by cuffs and eventually developing a friendship\"-routine. The story is as predictable as it is entertaining, mainly thanks to the chemistry between George and Waltz, both excellent actors in their own rights. Like professional tennis-players they ball each other lines and cues, often with hilarious results. More than in your typical TV-Krimi, there's plenty of action, gunfire and chases, considering that Schimanski already has his man literally by the cuffs (or does he?). It was just this mentioned chemistry that was missing in many latter \"Schimanskis\", since none of his future partners could fill the shoes of either (then deceased) Eberhard Feik or Christopher Waltz, often reducing the Schimanski-figure to a sort of lone wolf.", "It's only a shame that Waltz never played alongside George again. Waltz as a (more-or-less) struggling actor in Germany and Austria had played numerous TV-thrillers, most which were pretty forgettable with the exception of Waltz performance itself. But, as we now know, the actor would in a few years time after \"Blutsbrüder\" go on to far bigger things, like winning the Oscars twice (so far) and establishing himself among the leading actors of Hollywood. \"From 'Tatort' to Millionaire\", so to speak. The episode in context of the new Schimanski films, gets a solid 8/10."]},

Basically, like the botched Eddie Murphy film The Haunted Mansion, Tower of Terror is a vehicle to show off a Disney World attraction through a 90-minute narrative commercial. Unlike The Haunted Mansion, however, this film is actually good! The story focuses on Buzzy Crocker (Guttenberg), a journalist for a National Enquirer-esquire tabloid. In an attempt to become a serious writer again (and win back the affection of his old flame Jill (Nia Peebles)), Buzzy heads to the old Hollywood Tower Hotel, where he is told five people mysteriously disappeared in an elevator after the hotel was struck by lightning nearly 60 years prior. Said to be haunted, Buzzy wants to find out the truth and his niece Anna (Dunst) wants to join along with him to help make the story.", "While the film is certainly nothing Emmy-award winning, it delivers on all it promises.

It does stick around the typical standard of Disney TV movies as far as writing & directing go, but it manages to work in a way that looks and feels better than even a big-screen adaptation like The Haunted Mansion. Obviously, this is not going to be the film for someone looking for a hardcore frightfest, but for a lighthearted time with or without the kids, I'd highly suggest this one.", "Final Verdict: 7/10.", "NOTE: Disney is apparently in the process of making another feature-length adaptation of the Tower of Terror ride, this one for the big screen.", "-AP3-"]},

The film is very dated and only covers the first six years of U.F.O. encounters in the US, starting with the 1947 Kenneth Arnold sighting and closing with the famous appearance of multiple mysterious flying objects over Washington, DC in 1952. The few interview and footage sequences are bridged by recreations of US Air Force press officer Albert Chop's (Tom Towers) examinations of various sightings. Real footage of the Montana and Utah sightings is shown (and examined frame by frame in the epilogue) but, after 90 minutes of portentous setup, the brief, grainy images are anticlimactic. More interesting than the U.F.O.s themselves are the reactions of the public and responses of the government (including President Harry Truman) who were genuinely concerned (although at the dawn of the cold war, the fears were as much about foreign powers as about malevolent aliens). Overall, 'Unidentified Flying Objects: The True Story of Flying Saucers' is tedious (especially the endless monotonal narration by Olan Soule) but at least is more sincere and less sensationalistic than later entries in the 'U.F.O.s are real!' genre (notably, there are no 'recreations' of saucers or aliens, just of human observers and analysts). To be fair to the film and its makers, it should be 'seen' through 1950 eyes, not 2020 eyes: more than 60 years have passed since the Arnold sighting and the entry of the term 'flying saucer' into popular culture, but despite the off-and-on hype, nothing has ever come of the claims that extra-terrestrial intelligences are visiting our skies other than a lot of great (and not-so-great) movies and TV shows, a few amusing songs, some celebrities making fools of themselves, and the memorable debut episode of 'South Park' (but, just in case, \"Keep watching the skies!\")."]},

She is forced to accept their offer and starts working there as a regular papparazzo.

However, she refuses to take his multi-million dollar settlement but instead asks that she retain her maiden name. Despite all seeming amicable in their parting of ways, Nora finds out that Leland has had her blackballed from professional newspaper photojournalism. After sending out 200 resumes, the only place looking to hire her is a sleazy celebrity tabloid called The Comet. Owned by Sir Rudolph Halley (played by Tim Curry) but is run by the ruthless, morally bankrupt Camilla Dane (played by Holland Taylor). Nora looks down on this type of work and attempts to bring some class to The Comet, though her attempts fail after she is trampled on her first assignment, which is to get the urine of Anna Nicole Smith to run a pregnancy test on it. She stoops to the level of her colleagues and comes to accept the work she must do. As she grows to enjoy the work, she soon finds working at The Comet to be something she never expected... fun. However, in the second season, The Comet is purchased by Les Polanski (played by George Wendt) with the intention to make it into a respectable newspaper. In doing this, he takes Nora off photography and makes her an advice columnist. These episodes tended to focus more on the relationship between the paparazzi and celebrities as well as the office goings on at The Comet. During the third season, Camilla quits the Comet and goes to the National Inquisitor, a rival tabloid. She takes Nora with her and they enjoy their new colleagues as well as getting the latest tabloid scoop."]},

Though the video cover announces this film as 'A true story of a modern-day Elephant Man, and other human oddities', the actual character concerned shares equal screen time with 'the other human oddities'.", "\nAllusions to Lynch's film begin during the title sequence: a shot of a pair of legs ascending a dark staircase to a soundtrack of heavy breathing. We then cut to our Elephant Man hideously deformed face as he enters his apartment and embraces his wife. Following this we see another character jogging in the distance towards the camera. This lengthy sequence culminates as he crests the horizon and we are astonished to notice that he has no feet. There then follows a montage of assorted fairground scenes, such as 'normal people' peering into distorting mirrors, before the narrator, the Canadian classical actor Christopher Plummer, steps onto the screen to deliver the film's brief, spouting such trite lines as 'If we were they, what would our world look like?' with the required solemnity.", "\nAfter a little research I discovered that Harry Rasky is actually a rather well-respected television journalist and documentary-maker in his native Canada, better known for his art documentaries on Chagall and Degas, and notably a feature on Christopher Plummer himself ('Christopher Plummer: King of Players' 1998). He also wrote the biography 'Tennessee Williams: A Portrait in Laughter and Lamentation' in 1986. 'Being Different' looks rather out of place in an otherwise distinguished oeuvre due to it's intrinsically uninformative nature, and to the fact that its emotive subject renders it a rather difficult film to view objectively.", "\nFor the initial half hour we our transported to Gibsinton, Florida, the Carnival capital of America we are informed, where we are introduced to the inhabitants of the mobile community that make their living as sideshow freaks. These included a set of Siamese Twins,'the fattest man in the world', 'the tallest man in the world' (trivia fans: this is Johann Petursson, an Icelandic giant who appeared in the 1950 film 'Prehistoric Woman') and Alligator man and the bearded Monkey Girl ('the strangest married couple in the world'). From here on we get whisked off on a guided tour of the human oddities of North America, visiting en route the world's tallest woman in Niagara Falls, a midget in Montreal, numerous limb-less people, and a convention of The Little People of America.", "\nBy allowing them to tell their stories by means of a series of interviews, Rasky admirably introduces these characters as essentially human beings who have miraculously overcome their physical disabilities to lead a normal life. There is some truly astonishing material here, including scenes of a man with no legs going swimming and a woman with no arms squeezing herself into a pair of jeans. Unfortunately we are treated to the pretty much the same old thing over and over again. There are too many similar characters shown going about their daily business, giving the same one-line responses to the prurient questioning into their sex lives, and the film is at least 20 minutes too long. A lengthy scene in a disco of 'normal people' is rather arbitrarily included to give us pause for thought about two thirds of the way through. There are also a number of appalling musical interludes which date the film badly to the 'Fame' era, consisting of montages of left-over footage accompanied by cheesy early 80's power-ballads with music by music by Paul Zaza and atrocious lyrics written by Rasky himself.", "\nUltimately a documentary filmmaker works with the same market concerns as those of the feature film. Despite never being truly exploitative, 'Being Different' is nevertheless grounded in the same Circus geekshow mentality of the Gibsinton carnival with which the film opens, given the respectable veneer of early 80's political correctness by a platitudinous commentary which mentions 'the triumph of the human spirit' on at least three occasions. In using real-life circus freaks within the framework of a fantasy narrative, Todd Browning's 'Freaks' (1932) was less condescending and much more interesting. Other uses of real-life freaks in cinema include Michael Winner's diabolical (in both senses of the word) horror film, 'The Sentinel' (1977)."]},

Bobby believes his fortunes will change when his accountant Afrim changes hats and writes a science-fiction alien invasion screenplay that Bobby thinks all studios will clamor for and has Oscar written all over it. He has a small stable of followers who support his vision in being part of this movie, which eventually includes Daisy--a stereotypical small town girl looking to make it big in Hollywood==as the female lead. Having just arrived in town, she does not know her way around the Hollywood system--except on her back. Bobby is not averse to telling bald-faced lies in his singular focus in getting the picture made and distributed all on this $2,184 as a starting point. It is using several of those lies that he is able to get a verbal confirmation from big studio executive Jerry Renfro to distribute the movie *if* it stars Kit Ramsey, arguably the biggest action star in the world. Using similar lies, Bobby, however, is unable to convince Kit to star in the movie. Kit, who has a weakness for the Laker Girls, is a self-absorbed and paranoid movie star whose life and thus career is largely directed behind the scenes by Terry Stricter, the head of a New Age religion called MindHead. Bobby comes up with a scheme that he believes will get around Kit not agreeing to star: film Kit without him knowing that he is being filmed. The only person who knows of the scheme is Dave, Bobby's lowest of low level inside man turned cinematographer who has unofficial (i.e. technically stolen and thus free) access to studio camera equipment and general knowledge of Kit's general day-to-day movements through the studio system. Bobby is able to convince all the other actors that Kit's acting process involves him not interacting with them outside of filming the specific scenes he has with them. Part of Bobby's scheme involves using Kit's general paranoia that aliens truly are invading the planet to get his gut reactions to what is happening within the context of the script. But Bobby knows he has to get Kit to scream the closing lines of the movie \"gotcha suckas\" for the movie to be a success. Complications ensue when another of the the actors, Carol, tries to go against Bobby's policy of not making contact with Kit outside of filming, and when Bobby is required to hire a production assistant cum stunt double cum acting double, whose job in part is to stand-in for the requisite Kit Ramsey naked-ass shot. Through it all, Bobby will know if he has made it in Hollywood if he gets a specific sign specifically from the heavens in the form of FedEx.", "Living at the fringes of Hollywood's star system, second-rate movie producer Bobby Bowfinger is teetering on the brink of bankruptcy. However, when Bobby gets his hands on a bold and surprisingly fresh script, all he needs is a camera, a crew, and a star, preferably insecure megastar Kit Ramsey, to shoot his ambitious project. Now, armed with a desperate but cunning plan and the unconditional help of an unexpected ally, devious Bobby embarks on a mission to make a film on a shoestring budget, and he won't take no for an answer. After all, to survive in the cut-throat world of show business, one must be prepared to do whatever it takes to succeed. But the question remains. Can shameless Bobby pull off the ultimate scheme?", "Hollywood, today: Bobby Bowfinger, a run-down actor/producer/director, is reading a script which a friend has written. Completely convinced of its quality, he decides to take a last shot at fame and fortune. But the script is not that easy to sell, and a famous producer promises him to do it, but there is one condition: Kit Ramsey, Hollywood's #1 star, must be in it. So Bobby tries his luck with Kit--who says no--then decides to shoot the film himself. With the cheapest team available in Southern California, an aspiring beauty from Ohio, a diva who is just a little over the hill, a key-holding gofer from a major studio, and a goon hired away from burger-flipping, Bobby sets out to shoot the science-fiction-film starring Kit Ramsey--who does not even know he's being filmed.", "When grasping director Bobby Bowfinger finally finds the \"perfect\" script, a cheesy sci-fi story called \"Chubby Rain\", he decides to put everything on the line and give it a shot: gathering together an ambitious young Ohio actress, a melodramatic stage actress, and a laid-back male hopeful. Armed with a handful of illegal immigrants for a crew, a tiny budget, and equipment stolen from a nearby studio, Bowfinger lacks just one thing: Hollywood's hottest action star, Kit Ramsey. Refusing to give up when Kit doesn't take the part, Bowfinger and his crew do whatever it takes to complete the flick: secretly filming Kit without his permission and using his nerdy look-alike brother to fill in for remaining scenes.", "The movie opens with Bobby Bowfinger sitting alone in his office reading a script. As he finishes reading the script, he gets a twinkle in his eye, believing that he's found the perfect movie moment. The next day he gathers his staff and actors and tells them about the brilliant script called \"Chubby Rain\" that was written by his very own accountant Afrim. They then figure that this is their only shot at making a movie. So Bobby gets out his life savings - some $2200, and they start getting the equipment and the crew that they need to make the movie.", "Bobby then goes to meet executive agent Jerry Renfro at a chic Hollywood restaurant. He slips the maitre d' $20 and asks to be seated at the table next to Renfro. As he pretends to be an elite movie producer and fakes his way into having a conversation with Renfro about the script for Chubby Rain. He hands the script to Renfro and he reads through it, eventually agreeing with Bobby about the script's final moment which has the hero screaming \"Gotcha suckers!!\" that that is a great catch phrase. Bobby tells Jerry about the plans to get Kit Ramsey in the film's lead role. He then agrees that if Bobby gets Kit Ramsey, they've got a go picture.", "In Kit's mansion, he is unloading at his agent, telling him about how there's no good Hollywood moments and no good catchphrases anymore, that it's all style and no substance. The agent tries to tell him that the script he's just read is good and this movie has that moment, but it's not the moment that Kit is looking for. Kit then heads to his weekly appointment at Mindhead, a psychological collective that has obtained cult-like status among the Hollywood elite. Bobby has managed to sneak past the gate and heads to talk to Kit, now pretending to be a script delivery guy for a major Hollywood agent. He and Kit are having what appears to be a civilized conversation, and Bobby tells about how he's about to go for his appointment at Mindhead. Kit offers Bobby a ride to Mindhead, but when Bobby reveals who he really is, Kit goes ballistic and has him thrown out of the car.", "Back at the office, Bobby comes up with another idea - they film the movie without Kit knowing that he's going to be in it. His producer Dave thinks this is a bad idea but Bowfinger decides to pursue it anyway. We then see a young woman named Daisy, who is looking for work, getting off a bus. She goes to Bowfinger's \"studio\" where he has her audition for the female part in the movie. Daisy is a naive Midwestern woman who is a first time actress seeking fame and fortune.", "Kit goes to his meeting to meet Terry Stricter, who is the head psychiatrist at Mindhead for his weekly meeting. Kit talks to Terry about how he's better when he goes to his happy place and that he heavily believes in aliens and conspiracy theories. Dr. Stricter then reassures Kit that he will not do the one unforgivable action - show \"it\" (meaning his male organ) to the Lakers cheerleaders.", "Back at Bowfinger Films, Bobby is giving a pep talk to his staff about how this is the opportunity that they've been given to finally make a motion picture. And that once they're famous and successful, that Fedex truck will be making multiple stops at their studio with future projects, and that will be the day that they truly know they've made it. Bobby then wonders what exactly they're really in for with no star.", "Day 1: Bowfinger tells Dave to supply the equipment. He does so by checking out a camera from his day job at Universal, and using the van with S&Y Construction painted on the side. The first shot of \"Chubby Rain\" is Daisy chasing Kit's limo as it leaves his mansion for Mindhead. Kit has no idea what's going on as he looks out his window and sees the action behind him. Back at Bowfinger films, they are reviewing the first shot of the movie and Bowfinger realizes that this movie is going to work.", "Day 2: Kit and his agent are having a meeting at another chic Hollywood restaurant. Bowfinger and his crew are going to be there. Bowfinger cleverly disguises his crew to look like homeless people as they shoot the first scene of dialogue involving Carol and Kit. But Kit still has no idea what's going on, and Carol's approach and the dialogue about the movie - which discusses alien love, has made him even more paranoid than normal. Kit is resuming the conversation that he had with his agent about how there are no good scripts out there. Kit then heads to an emergency meeting with Terry Stricter. Kit then reveals to Dr. Stricter about his plans to show \"it\" to the Laker cheerleaders.", "Day 3: Daisy and Slater are discussing that they both need some more scenes with Kit, and are discussing the best course of action to take as far as getting some actual screen time with Kit. Although no one still has any clue as to the fact that Kit doesn't know that he's in the movie. Afrim even has written some extra scenes with Kit to incorporate into the movie.", "Day 4: Dave has tracked Kit to Mindhead. In the parking lot, they film the climactic scene in the movie where Carol confronts Kit in the parking lot. Kit, still unaware of his involvement in the film, thinks that someone is actually following him through the parking lot and begins to freak out. It's then revealed that Bowfinger has his dog wearing a pair of high heels following Kit through the parking lot. Back at the offices, they review the film and Carol is completely in awe of Kit's professionalism. Afrim is bragging about his screenwriting abilities to Daisy, who then sees an opportunity to get some more screen time in the film.", "Day 5: Kit is heading to an upscale department store to buy some new clothes. The store offers him the clothes for nothing if Kit makes an appearance outside their store. Kit demands $1000. Carol decides to confront Kit and then begins to talk about their screen time in the film. That makes Kit even more paranoid than usual. At Kit's mansion, Terry Stricter makes a house call and Kit talks about how the aliens might be following him. Dr. Stricter then offers to let Kit stay in Mindhead's special \"celebrity quarters\". Back at Bowfinger films, they're wondering what to do now that Kit's out of the picture. Bowfinger then instructs Dave to hold auditions to find anyone that even remotely looks like Kit to get the shots for the scenes that they need. He then settles on a guy named Jiff.", "Day 6: Bowfinger's first day of shooting with Jiff. who bears an unbelievably striking resemblance to Kit, has him running across US-101 in Los Angeles. Jiff fears for his life running across the freeway but Bowfinger assures him that the stunt isn't for nothing.", "Day 7: Bowfinger is realizing his cash supply is dwindling at an extremely rapid rate. Thankfully he has a date with Daisy that night, who's manipulating Bowfinger into getting some more screen time and time with Jiff / Kit. Bowfinger then catches a break when Daisy leaves her wallet unguarded and then takes advantage of her \"lost\" credit card and uses it to purchase tons of equipment that they then use to shoot additional scenes with.", "Day 8: The new equipment that Bowfinger purchased allows them to shoot some indoor scenes for the movie, and Daisy and Jiff have their on screen romantic moment together.", "Day 9: Just as no one knows where Kit is, Carol stumbles upon an opportunity to shoot the next scene for the film - Kit is appearing at the department store that he was in just days before. They borrow Renfro's one of a kind 1946 Buick to use to shoot the scenes with. This scene they approach Kit (or Keith Kincade) in the department store, once again freaking him out. Bowfinger is approached by a cop who stops him and asks for a film permit. Bobby instead offers him a part in the movie. As the scene unfolds, it freaks Kit out to the point where he does anything he can to run from what's happening.", "Day 10: While sitting at a diner eating breakfast, Jiff reveals that he's in fact the biological brother of Kit Ramsey - not just some guy who really looks like Kit Ramsey. This causes Bowfinger to have a change of heart as to how Jiff is being used in the film. But Jiff really likes working for Bowfinger and is excited to be a part of cinema where before he was working at a fast food restaurant.", "Day 11: A security guard discovers the \"found footage\" of Chubby Rain locked up with all the rest of the equipment that Dave was borrowing and reports it to Mindhead, causing Terry Stricter to become suspicious about what's really going on. Meanwhile, they're getting ready to shoot the film's big ending scene at the Griffith Observatory. Dave checks out a crane truck and then they disguise it to shoot Kit's car from overhead. The final scene begins to play out and Kit is heading to the Griffith Observatory as originally planned. Afrim disguises himself as a mutated alien causing Kit to really freak out and get in the car, Daisy follows, and then Slater follows with Jerry Renfro's car. Just as Kit is about to say the film's signature catch line \"Gotcha Suckers\", Bowfinger is discovered by Terry Stricter who was proven right about how the paranoid some times are actually being followed.", "Back at Bowfinger Films, the group is completely defeated and begins to wonder how they're going to turn their careers around - if they have a shot at all. That is until Dave comes back with the crew and tells Bobby about how they followed Kit around to obtain some extra shots for the movie. The footage proves to be useless until one piece catches Bobby's eye. They now have the permission they need.", "Bobby heads to Mindhead to show Stricter the footage they recorded of Kit. It turns out that he did in fact show \"it\" to the Laker Cheerleaders - only to be met with hysterical laughter. Bowfinger tells Stricter that they could use this and it'd make a great ending for Chubby Rain, but it would also ruin Kit's career. Stricter confers with his council and agrees.", "We are then shown the premiere of Chubby Rain. Bowfinger gets a front row seat and is stunned to watch his vision become a reality. Back at the offices, he's greeted with a standing ovation. Then - just as he predicted - the Fedex truck shows up at his door and hands Bobby an envelope. What's inside is a contract for Bowfinger films to make a Kung Fu movie in Thailand starring Jiff Ramsey. The movie ends with the opening of the newest film from Bowfinger Productions called \"Fake Purse Ninjas\"."]},

The two shorts were edited together into one continuous film. Laurel and Hardy read their lines from cue cards on which French was written phonetically. At the time of early talkies, dubbing was not yet perfected. The same was done for a Spanish language version, ", ".", "The vibrating reducing machine with a single belt--which Stanley clowns with while Ollie dons his boots--has somehow acquired a second belt, when shown in the background in subsequent shots.", "Alternate-language version of ", " (1930)", "Back when I was collecting Super-8mm prints of old movies in the 1970s, a friend of mine who'd been traveling in Europe returned with a real find: an early talkie in which Stan and Ollie speak French! Their phonetic French sounds as awkward as you'd imagine, but the novelty sure does boost the viewing experience. I screened Les Carottiers several times for friends. On one particular occasion when native speakers of French were present, the movie scored a huge hit. I was told afterward that Laurel & Hardy recited their lines like kids in a school play, which suits their characters nicely. This fascinating oddity is quite funny and well worth seeing, but remains a rarity. Unless someone puts out a DVD collection of Laurel & Hardy's foreign language releases -- and I hope someone will -- these films are hard to find. Meanwhile, the background on the circumstances under which they were made is rather interesting.", "In the early talkie days, before dubbing or subtitling had been perfected, some of the Hollywood studios experimented with shooting alternate versions of certain features and shorts in various European languages. Producers could hire an entirely new group of actors (as with the Spanish Dracula, Carlos Villarias, and his co-stars) or simply utilize the language skills of such stars as Greta Garbo, who played Anna Christie in both English and German. A third possibility was to have the actors memorize their lines phonetically, assisted by off-camera chalkboards. This method would have made serious drama laughable, but comedies were enhanced by the stars' struggles with unfamiliar tongues. Les Carottiers (loosely, \"The Chiselers\") is a pseudo-feature that consists of two short films, Be Big and Laughing Gravy, spliced into a somewhat disjointed whole, linked by a single silent film-style title card which ties the stories together. Anita Garvin repeats her role as Mrs. Laurel from the English language version of Be Big, but the French Mrs. Hardy is a different actress. Charlie Hall repeats his roles from the English versions of both films: he's a delivery boy in the first half and, more prominently, the dog-hating landlord in Part Two. As the clean-shaven delivery boy Hall recites his lines phonetically, but in his second role he mimes his part while a gruff-voiced French actor delivers his lines off-camera, an approach made credible by the bushy mustache Hall wears that obscures his mouth.", "So much for background. How does this oddity hold up today? Well, the second half is quite funny if you last that long. The first half, Be Big, is frustratingly unfunny in any language, and serves as a kind of litmus test of the viewer's tolerance for Laurel & Hardy's style of comedy. Most of the action consists of Ollie laboring to yank off a pair of too-tight boots, and even the novelty value of French dialog fades fast, as so much of it consists of grunts and yowls. But stick around and you'll be able to enjoy the team's most successful variant on a favorite motif: the struggle to keep a pet in lodgings where animals are not welcome. In Angora Love the boys were stuck with a fragrant goat, and in the featurette The Chimp they were the reluctant keepers of a circus gorilla, but in both of those stories the animals were unpleasant and unwanted in the first place. Here the animal in question is a sweet, scruffy little dog, so the struggle to protect him from eviction engages our sympathy more than in the other films. It's winter, it's cold outside, and the mean-spirited landlord wants to pitch their adorable pooch out into the snow.", "As in the English language version much of the humor is essentially silent, and what dialog there is in Les Carottiers can be pretty easily followed whether you speak French or not, at least until the final sequence. Happily, LeRoy Shields' delightful background music was retained, including the melancholy \"Dog Song.\" The biggest change from the familiar version of Laughing Gravy to be found here is the radically different ending -- which, I gather, follows the script originally intended for the English language version. Instead of the smallpox quarantine and landlord Hall's abrupt off-screen suicide (!!?!) Les Carottiers veers into something completely unexpected: Stan receives word that his rich uncle has died and left him a fortune, with the stipulation that he parts with Ollie, who the uncle blames for Stan's lowly status. After his initial shock passes, Ollie sadly urges Stan to accept the terms and go, but insists on keeping the dog. Stan tears up his uncle's letter and check and elects to stay -- but only for the sake of Laughing Gravy!", "This finale is quite talk-y, and struggling with all that complicated dialog must have been a real chore for Stan and Babe, funny as it is to hear them now. Beyond that, the last-minute inheritance twist is out of keeping with the tone of the rest of Laughing Gravy, which mostly consists of slapstick sequences: hurling tubs full of water, falling off the roof into a rain barrel, etc. During this final sequence we suddenly seem to be in a different kind of movie, and it's not a very satisfying pay-off; perhaps that's why it was cut from the English language version. Oh well. Whatever the case, this film is a fascinating thing to see. Now why can't more people see it? Who holds the rights to these things?", "P.S. Early 2007: I'm pleased to report that this film has been included in the 21-disc Laurel & Hardy box set available in the U.K., along with several of the boys' other foreign language releases."]},

Being a huge fan of the manga series and of the subsequent animated series, I was looking forward to this big budget take on the series.   CAT'S EYE the movie takes the basic concept but fails to live up to the source material.  The casting is superb, you couldn't get a better cast.  The trio of Norika Fujiwara (Rui), Izumi Inamori (Hitomi) and Yuki Uchida (Ai) definitely fit the roles and PVC costumes well.  And what costumes they wear!  Unfortunately the story is a total mess.  The original story is tossed away and instead we are presented with a James Bond inspired ripoff complete with a mysterious crime syndicate/evil organization and their `Dragon Lady' leader played with hammy delight by Taiwanese actress Jiang Wenli.  Ninja Master, Sho Kosugi's son Kane Kosugi appears as well playing, what else, a Ninja-like Assassin. This film borrows too heavily from the Joel Schumacher school of campy direction and what we get is half Batman & Robin and half John Woo's Once A Thief. And wait until you get a load of the ludicrous ending!  A missed opportunity at what could have been a cult fan hit.  The opening animation sequence was inspired, too bad the rest of the film couldn't follow suit."]},

That film was extraordinary then for having multiple scenes and a semblance of a narrative; additionally, the use of dissolves as transitions in it influenced other filmmakers for years to do the same. Méliès was the cinema world's preeminent leader then. By 1912, however, that was no longer the case; frankly, as evidenced by this feature, his style had become dated. Moreover, Méliès had begun to adopt techniques from other filmmakers, such as direct cuts instead of dissolves, and there's even a match on action shot during the slipper trying-on scene.", "Yet, mostly, despite its short length, this film really drags in pacing. The opening camera placement doesn't change for four minutes. In the late 1890s and early 1900s, Méliès's was advancing the medium largely by imitating theatre, in addition to his cinematic trick effects, but by 1912, other filmmakers had begun and adopted cinematic forms of narrative--best remembered today through the Biograph shorts of D.W. Griffith, but others were doing similar things, too. Méliès's film-making was now backwards.", "Another complaint: perhaps, impolite to say, but the Cinderella here isn't even very attractive.

Here one has the added complications of a teenage girl whose 'silent love' is longing to be awakened and a jealous husband who succumbs to 'mans instinct to kill' only to be thwarted by Mother Nature. This heady mixture is strengthened by the chiaroscuro cinematography of Alex Phillips and a lush score by Raul Lavista. This is really an excellent film noir in Hollywood mode with the bonus of a literate script and smouldering Latin 'heat' without the obligatory Hollywood happy ending. Director Julio Bracho has concentrated on 'character' and on those little looks that speak volumes. De Cordoba did a Hollywood stint of course but was always far too interesting to play the Latin Lover. He was far more effective on 'home turf' and his portrayal here as the 'tortured' surgeon would make his outstanding performance a few years later as a paranoid in 'El' for Bunuel a natural progression. The final scene of Gloria Marin and Lilia Michel at the waterfall is stupendous. A must for all lovers of film noir."]},

Eschewing the coy American standard for this genre, we are instead provided with the absurd and alienating environment of southern Ontario. The success of such a daring endeavour logically rests on the shoulders of its stars and Truninger has cast a pair of superb comic performers especially relative unknown Tim Dutton, whose charisma marks him for major leading man status. Helen Baxendale does equally well in her flakier and slightly less sympathetic role. The film is further distinguished by the subtle painterly cinematography of Martin Fuhrer, particularly in the title sequence that cleverly combines a burnished dawn tableau with a cheeky score by Mark Suozzo.

Basically it's a burlesque film not unlike the other ones Tucker directed (Baghdad after Midnight and Tiajuana after Midnight)-- a series of statically-shot burly-Q dancers doing their routines in front of a curtain, mixed with old-fashioned baggy-pants burlesque comic doing their routines and a vague, loosely-structured \"Plot\" that is in itself just a series of set-up pieces and routines. If you've never seen DANCE HALL RACKET or Broadway JUNGLE, the two films that to me are Tucker's masterpieces, you may not be prepared for something like this. Obviously shot in a few days in a small part of a small studio, DREAM FOLLIES is so anti-cinematic on every level, that it almost approaches the level of a stag film or an early Warhol effort. Signs are misspelled, edits are not matched, outrageous library harp music is used at inopportune moments at the beginning and end as a kind of framing device, and the performers are right off the burlesque stage. Some of the performers will be familiar to fans of Dance Hall Racket--\"Icepick\" is here, as is the guy with the bad toupee. And of course Lenny Bruce and his Mom. There is actually some excellent \"Stripper\" jazz played during the dance sequences that gives you a wonderful window into the long-gone days of classic burlesque, where jazz musicians would slum by playing in these bands and basically improvise on familiar riffs (one of these is basically a jam on \"Lester Leaps In\"). The comedy scenes in the office are played in an exaggerated manner below the lowest-grade Educational Pictures 1930s comedy shorts, and some sequences are shot silent and played in a silent-comedy manner with pratfalls and over-the-top reactions. Dick Kimball, the Bud Abbott of these z-grade quickies and no doubt a man with decades of burlesque comedy experience, delivers the antiquated risqué jokes as if this is the third show of the day in Barstow and he's looking forward to getting off the stage and getting a drink, but for those of us too young to have ever seen this kind of thing in person, the film is a wonderful time capsule. Of course, this film is not for the average viewer--it's amateurish on a level that makes Jerry Warren look like Spielberg, but Phil Tucker frankly didn't care. He had to get 65 minutes on the screen, and he did, and on a lowbrow level he completely achieved what he set out to achieve. The cheapness and lack of technique give the film a kind of authenticity and anti-Hollywood ambiance that I for one find refreshing. It's like the equivalent of a locally-recorded two-chord garage-band single--badly pressed and mastered, amateurishly performed, and failing every test of \"correct\" technique, but full of a kind of spirit and fun that make it timeless. If I had stumbled into a skidrow grindhouse in 1955 after having had a half-dozen drinks and was attracted by the promise of burlesque skin, and this film was shown on a big screen, I'm sure I would have loved it and felt that I'd gotten my money's worth. I've watched this film once a year for a decade. If you are a fan of Tucker or 1950s z-grade exploitation films, you will be similarly enthralled. Otherwise, don't watch this in a million years."]},

All five of these early entries were adapted from recent publications by original Chan creator Earl Derr Biggers, Fox beginning their run of globetrotting originals in 1934 with \"Charlie Chan in London,\" continuing all the way up until the 1942 release of \"Castle in the Desert,\" the 11th outing for Oland's capable replacement, Sidney Toler. The problem with the Spanish \"Eran Trece\" is not just the absence of Warner Oland, Manuel Arbo cast as the Chinese detective living with his growing family on Punchbowl Hill, but its slavish adherence to the Biggers novel \"Charlie Chan Carries On,\" the character kept off screen for the entire first half as a rather lazy investigation is conducted by Scotland Yard's Inspector Duff (Rafael Calvo). Murder strikes a London hotel during a world cruise organized by Dr. Lofton (Julio Villarreal), all the suspects allowed to continue to their final destination in San Francisco due to lack of evidence or even motive, though it later becomes clear that the killer is using a phony name to infiltrate the party to avenge himself on a wife who ran off with another man, both now marked for death. The largely unknown Spanish cast ensures that tedium results from so many interchangeable characters cluttering up a nonexistent storyline, which would have benefitted greatly with their English speaking counterparts, in particular Warren Hymer and Marjorie White as the comic relief Chicago couple. Only when a stopover in Honolulu finally introduces Chan is there a reprieve, Arbo at least a physical match for Oland, yet he is given little to do but wander from one place to another as the ship moves on to California, his only recourse to set a trap for the culprit because of the absolute lack of clues available (the 1929 \"Behind That Curtain\" would have fared even worse, as the studio practically wrote Chan out of the story until the very end). Manuel Arbo may not be an ideal replacement for Warner Oland, but he enjoyed a lengthy career with over 200 credits in Mexico, working right up to his 1973 death. While \"Charlie Chan Carries On\" remains a lost film, one can happily indulge in its 1940 remake, \"Charlie Chan's Murder Cruise,\" this time keeping Sidney Toler's Chan front and center while eliminating Inspector Duff in the opening reel, and including not one but two Chan sons for company, Lionel Atwill as the cruise director."]},

This clip was filmed in Edison's studio on August 28, 1895. Mary is brought to the execution block and made to kneel down with her neck over it. The executioner lifts his axe ready to bring it down. After that frame Mary has been replaced by a dummy. The axe comes down and severs the head of the dummy from the body. The executioner picks up the head and shows it around for everyone else to see. One of the first 'camera tricks' to be used in a movie. It shocked audiences in its day, but for obvious reasons it today looks quite fake. This is also one of the first if not the first film reproducing a historical scene going for the best possible realism, a description that later became a definition for a genre.

I've seen quite a few of these tinted films from this era and I must admit that this here is the best one I've seen. I really loved all the colors being thrown around and this is easy to see when the troubadour first goes to see the witch. The color of their outfits are really terrific and the look of the witch is rather breathtaking and will make you think of the 1939 version of THE WIZARD OF OZ. The story itself is pretty strong as well, although the subplot of the troubadour trying to save a princess being held captive stops the film in its tracks to a point. With that said, there are plenty of wild special effects and neat tricks to make this a must see from the filmmography of Melies."]},

The special effects are a mix of dry ice and what appears to be more dry ice, but the lighting is at times interesting. The cast members have stark and/or dark features, and the B&W medium in combination with dramatic lighting for scenes within the haunted mansion make for a very good effect. You usually come to 'like' a character in a movie, and in this movie there isn't anyone to like. It seems that everyone is a dumb creep with some kind of motive. Just how much that works to the film's advantage, however, is difficult to say because it might be lost on a more casual viewer, but I think that it makes the story interesting. There are a few sidelines to the plot which were either never developed or lost to editing, but they are minor enough to not affect the continuity of the film. The screams are great. Hollywood just doesn't have screamers like it used to. I would recommend this movie, if you can find it."]},

The plot for The Grey Vulture really is simple. A young cowboy, Bart Miller -- played by Maynard, constantly reads a book about a knight from 300 years earlier named The Grey Vulture. In his attempts to emulate the hero of the book he gets himself into trouble. ", "The opening sequence shows Bart Miller (Maynard) dressed in armor in the part of the mythical knight saving a young lady (Hazel Deane) and her father (Whitehorse) from a group of evil men in a daring chase on horseback. The scene is played again at the end of the movie when Bart saves the girl, Betty Taylor, and her father, Bill Taylor, from the bad guys. The climax of course is another chase on horseback. ", "An old joke appears in this old movie when Bart Miller tries to stop a fight between an old man and his wife.", "Maynard: \"Have you no respect for a lady?\"", "Old Man: \"I respect a lady-- but that's my wife!\"", "A point of interest is that this movie is not set in the old west, but in present day 1926. There are horses and a stagecoach. Plenty of cowboys are in this one. There are no automobiles, telephones, or radios like in many of the B westerns of the 30's and 40's, especially Roy Rogers' movies. What gives it away is the way the girls are portrayed. Betty Taylor and a group of friends from school are visiting her father's ranch. They are all dressed in 1920's dresses with short hair. The girls dance with the cowboys before they go for a swim. There are closeups of the girls' exposed legs as they dance in their 1920's short bathing suits. When they all go for a swim in the \"pool\", which turns out to be a natural pond, the cowboys are standing around watching them frolic in the water. This is not a typical element of a western film, but the men who saw this movie in 1926 surely were entertained. ", "Ken Maynard became one of the biggest western stars of the 20's and 30's, and The Grey Vulture is on par with the Tom Mix movies of the same period. Maynard's presence is fine, although he does not dominate all of the scenes.", "In a silent movie there really are no lines to be spoken, just a few to be read. Maynard provides plenty of action with some fighting and his horse riding scenes are truly excellent. His skills as a horseman were part of his success, and they were used well in many scenes of The Grey Vulture."]},

Going along with the picture's letter and pamphlet motif, however, she does leave them notes. Her contracting of TB, or \"consumption\" as it was more commonly called then (in movies, at least), also serves as something of a comeuppance, it would seem, for her lover's dismissive attitude of a Red Cross seal campaign request he receives, to which he replies that consumption doesn't exist in his country town.", "Nevertheless, such antipathy as displayed by this character is strikingly familiar to this day. It seems as though every illness needs to be blamed on some other by somebody. In the case of TB, it was known as an urban pestilence, which was true to the extent that people living close together is squalid conditions was a breading ground for the bacterium and that the factories filling the air with pollution made people more susceptible to and symptomatic from the disease. But, they did and they still do die in rural areas, too. Indeed, the NFPF entry compares such prejudice to that against gay men during the AIDS epidemic. I'm sure others could find similar parallels in the most recent pandemic of 2020. Speaking of which, in this film we also have a family doctor who diagnoses the woman with TB from a thermometer. She thought her coughing was from a cold and, yet, a fever proves otherwise somehow? Whether 1912 or 2020, one's temperature isn't a diagnosis.", "We also get a tacked-on happy ending involving a cure in this one (surprising for a film titled \"Hope,\" I know), the second such TB melodrama I've seen after Alice Guy's \"Falling Leaves\" (1912). In reality, it wouldn't be for a few more decades before more effective, antibiotic treatments were discovered."]},

The function of this formal playfulness is, among other things, to show that while the characters are in the bar their minds are often somewhere else. Especially La Femme keeps fantasizing about being far away on a real ship, and seeing her little tête-à-tête with the sailor more romantically than it actually is. And the sailor too, who is less romantically inclined, can practically already see how his future-conquest offers herself and her naked chest to him in a cabin. La Femme also occasionally thinks back to situations at home and so we learn a bit about what the relationship between her and her husband is like.", "An interesting thing to note is that the film plays a bit with gender roles, if not in the characters' actions than in their appearance.

Unfortunately, it was neither a good vehicle for him, nor did it show him to good advantage.  I recently saw a chopped up version of it on the new America One network. Chopped-up or not, the production values were so paltry that the viewing of this film soon had me laughing aloud.  And I am sure laughter was not the original intent of the movie-makers.  Just some of the moments I could not help snicker at (and, mind you, I am quite the opposite of a mean-spirited person, so this is not some attempt to make fun of anyone long gone and unable to defend themselves): * Some camera transitions were done with what must have been some kind of shade pulled sideways across the camera lens, opening and closing certain scenes, but done with such a shaky hand that it looked like someone was dragging a piece of cardboard across the lens. * A fire set in the weeds (to burn down a house with Buddy Roosevelt inside) suddenly moves completely inside with no trace of a fire outside at all -- and the outside of the house is completely untouched by fire.  Did the fire climb in through the window? * Buddy goes to fetch his horse that has run away, and retrieves it by \"untying\" the reins from a bush -- who exactly tied this horse to the bush? * Someone really should have coached Buddy Roosevelt physically.  He seemed like a skillful rider (he performed stunts for Marion Davies in the silent films), and he performs a couple of really dangerous stunts near the end, as he fights with the bad guy on a buckboard that is clearly racing along an actual cliff with the actual actors aboard.  But the man ran like Jerry Lewis screaming \"Hey, Lady!\" and he fought with little noodly punches and leapt down a cliff like a four year-old jumping into a pool full of cold water.  I was embarrassed at myself for how much I laughed out loud. There are moments like this literally every couple minutes of the film. All in all, I would want to own this movie for its unintentional humor, as in \"Plan 9 From Outer Space.\"  The big fight at the end made me laugh so hard I pulled a muscle in my lower back.  I'm not kidding."]},

He eventually kidnaps a woman and keeps her locked up in a shack in the woods as her friends try to find her. It's very important to keep in mind that this film beat PEEPING TOM and PSYCHO into theaters by a year so this film probably deserves to be better known among movie fans. Director Hilliard is best known for directing VIOLENT MIDNIGHT and writing the cult classic THE HORROR OF PARTY BEACH so it's interesting to see such an early cash-in on the sex maniac that would become more popular a decade or two later. This film has an ultra-low budget that doesn't allow for too much on the technical side but there are a few nice moments including one sequence in front of the mirror as the killer tries to \"paint\" over his face. The low-budget nature works in some ways as it gives the film a more documentary-like feel and this certainly helps in the scenes with the killer quietly stalking the women. What doesn't work too well are the performances, which are far from bad but none of them are good enough to really carry the movie. Another problem is the screenplay that never really gets too deep so don't expect anything psychological like the future Hitchcock film. Running a brief 58-minutes there's really not too much time to dig into any real issues with the killer so everything is pretty much just skipped in order to keep the film moving. We do get some brief nudity and a rather violent scene where the killer stones a woman to death but the blood level remains at zero. This certainly isn't a good movie but fans of the genre will probably want to check it out just to see something made before Norman Bates."]},

The lovely Panther Women of the title are the devoted servants of this black magician, and after pulling off some rather contorted murders which rely basically on the incompetence of the cops and the heroes showing up too late, they finally raise him as a zombie. Foiling their plans are two beautiful wrestlers (Ariane Welter and the stunning Elizabeth Campbell) and a Santo clone called Angel (Geraldo Zepeda, a veteran wrestler with a massive filmography). Manuel Loco Valdez shows up as a kind of Johnnie Walker comic sidekick. Most of the actual wrestling was done by several well-known luchadores of the time: Marina Rey, Maria Delgado, Judith Mercado, etc. It is basically a wrestling version of Lewton's Cat People, with black magic and crime syndicate elements thrown in. Nobody does pastiche quite like these Mexican B films, which are always totally free of the kind of WASPish prudishness found just under the naughty veneer of contemporary Hammer or American exploitation films.", "'Panther Women' careens along at an exciting pace, never lingering too long in one place, moving into the ring occasionally for several beautifully edited lucha matches. The end pits the Panther girls against the good guys and degenerates into a rabid, lunatic free for all. There is also a nice Cubano dance number, some atmospheric cult sequences around the warlock's tomb, and plenty of car chases (the dark wet city makes for an exciting ride). All in all, this is a whole lot of fun. Old pro Rene Cardona knows how to keep the leg and horror show rolling and knows that the girls are the true stars of the show. I'll take this inventive populist programmer over any of the inflated and tedious Marvel products anyday."]},

Unfortunately for everyone, this group ends up unleashing a curse which been laid on the dead High Priest Imhotep. Now 'The Mummy' is awake and it's going to take a lot more than guns to send him back to where he came from.", "Doomed to suffer unimaginable torture for all eternity, the traitorous high priest of Pharaoh Seti I, Imhotep, is buried alive. Nearly three millenniums later, in 1926, the intrepid American adventurer, Rick O'Connell, the bookish British Egyptologist, Evelyn, and her brother, Jonathan, unwisely embark on a dangerous treasure hunt in the lost city of Hamunaptra, only to inadvertently set free Imhotep. Now, the slowly regenerating creature plans his revenge, hell-bent on unleashing ten devastating plagues upon Egypt, and, above all, reunite with his eternal lover, Anck-Su-Namun. Do Rick, Evelyn, and Jonathan have what it takes to thwart the ancient entity's evil plans? Can they stop the Mummy?", "Thebes, 1290 BCE. People are very uptight, so high priest Imhotep and Anck-su-namun, Pharaoh Seti I's unwilling concubine, must hide their love. But like all forbidden love, it ends in tragedy - they murder Seti, then Anck-su-Namun dies by her own hand rather than face the Medjai, the pharaoh's guard. Imhotep's plans to resurrect her fail, and he himself is subjected to the Hom-Dai - the worst of all ancient curses. Cut to 1926. We're in Cairo, where Evelyn Carnahan is wreaking absolute havoc on a museum library. Her brother, Jonathan, surprises her with an ancient puzzle box that he has stolen, and Evie confirms that he truly has found something this time. This seems like her chance to be a real egyptologist, so they go to shake down the victim of the theft. It turns out to be a very dirty Rick O'Connell who's about to be hung to death in a local prison. He claims to know the location of Hamunaptra, so naturally she haggles with the prison warden to save him. When Rick turns up for the boat, he's all cleaned up and looking fine, but there's a catch - the gross warden is coming with as a part of the deal. But they aren't the only ones looking for Hamunaptra, and the other group is led by someone who has been there, too - Rick's old foreign legion frenemy Beni. The two groups make a bet, and we're off to the races. They all reach the city (Evie wins the race thanks to her natural camel-riding skills) only to be confronted by the Medjai, modern descendants of the pharaoh's guard, led by Ardeth Bay. They ignore the warnings to leave and Evie uses her superior archaeology skills to search for the Book of Amun-Ra, while the other team digs around looking for treasure. Or perhaps not so superior, because what she actually finds is Imhotep, and the other team finds the Book of the Dead and valuable canopic jars containing what's left of Anck-su-namun. The warden and several diggers are mysteriously killed, but nobody is particularly bothered until Evie reads aloud from the Book of the Dead, waking Imhotep along with all the curses of Egypt. Imhotep seems to think she's Anck-su-namun, which doesn't bode well, but they're able to escape - except for Beni, who becomes Imhotep's personal assistant because he speaks Hebrew. Back in Cairo, Rick wants to run, but Evie feels (and is) responsible, so she's insistent on sticking around to fix it. Imhotep is hunting all of the people who looted his lover's canopic jars and sucking them dry, while the biblical plagues ravage the land. At the museum, Rick, Evie, and Jonathan go to visit Evie's boss for help only to find Ardeth there. They realize that Imhotep wants to sacrifice Evie and finally resurrect Anck-su-namun, and speculate that maybe if the Book of the Dead brought him back to life, maybe the Book of Amun-Ra can kill him. But even if they can find it, it's back in Hamunaptra. Meanwhile, Imhotep has zombified a bunch of civilians and corners the crew on the streets of Cairo. He takes Evie back to Hamunaptra and Rick, Jonathan, and Ardeth only barely escape with their lives. Since Imhotep has a head start from being able to travel as a sandstorm, they recruit a former RAF captain named Winston to fly them back. They make it just in time for Imhotep to spot them and crash their plane. Winston dies a happy man, but Rick, Jonathan, and Ardeth (who really enjoyed his plane ride) survive and make their way into Hamunaptra. Deep under the city, Imhotep prepares to sacrifice Evie and resurrect his Anck-su-Namun. Rick and crew fight Imhotep and his band of resurrected guards, freeing Evie so she can read a spell to make Imhotep human again. A ghost carriage from the afterlife comes and carries away his soul, they stab him in the gut, and then he stumbles back into a black pool full of souls. But the fun's not over, because Beni has been carrying loads of treasure off to load up the camels. He sets off a booby trap as they all try to escape, but doesn't make it out in time and is trapped with thousands of ravenous beetles as his torch slowly goes out. Luckily, this leaves Rick, Evie, and Jonathan with sacks full of gold as they ride off into the sunset.", "As punishment for killing Pharaoh Seti and touching his mistress Anck Su Namun, Egyptian priest Imhotep was cursed and mummified alive. But in 1923 he is inadvertently resurrected by treasure hunters and must be stopped before he can wreak his final vengeance on the world.", "In Egypt, circa 1290 BC, high priest Imhotep engages in an affair with Anck-su-Namun, the mistress of Pharaoh Seti, despite strict rules that other men are forbidden to touch her. When the Pharaoh discovers their tryst, Imhotep and Anck-su-Namun murder the monarch. Imhotep is dragged away by his priests before the Pharaoh's guards can discover his involvement; Anck-su-Namun then kills herself, intending for Imhotep to resurrect her. After Anck-su-Namun's burial, Imhotep breaks into her crypt and steals her corpse. He and his priests flee across the desert to Hamunaptra, the City of the Dead, where they begin the resurrection ceremony.", "However, they are caught by Seti's guards before the ritual could be completed, and Anck-su-Namun's soul is sent back to the Underworld. For their sacrilege, Imhotep's priests are mummified alive, and Imhotep himself is forced to endure the curse of Hom Dai: his tongue is cut out and he is buried alive with a swarm of flesh-eating scarabs. The ritual curses him to become an immortal walking plague if he were ever to be resurrected.", "He is buried under high security, sealed away in a sarcophagus below a statue of the Egyptian god Anubis, and kept under strict surveillance throughout the ages by the Medjai, descendants of Seti's palace guards. If Imhotep were ever to be released, the powers that made him immortal would allow him to unleash a wave of destruction and death upon the Earth.", "In 1923, soldiers from the French Foreign Legion, led by American Rick O'Connell, make a final stand at Hamunaptra against an overwhelming force of Medjai warriors. The soldiers are massacred and O'Connell makes a final retreat inside the city, only to be cornered by a group of Medjai. However, they flee when Imhotep's evil presence manifests itself, leaving him to die in the desert.", "In 1926, Cairo librarian and aspiring Egyptologist, Evelyn Carnahan is presented with an intricate box and map by her bumbling brother Jonathan, who says he found it in Thebes. The map seems to point the way to the lost city of Hamunaptra, where all of the wealth of Egypt was supposedly stored; however, the museum curator, Dr. Bey, dismisses Hamunaptra as a myth, and accidentally damages the map. Jonathan reveals he actually stole it from an American (revealed to be O'Connell), who is currently in prison, and may be able to tell more about Hamunaptra. Rick tells them that he knows the location of the city from his days in the Foreign Legion.", "He makes a deal with Evelyn to reveal the location of Hamunaptra, in exchange for Evelyn saving Rick from being hanged. Evelyn successfully negotiates his release from the prison warden by offering him 25% of the found treasure; however, the warden insist on coming along in order to protect his investment. They board a ship to start their expedition to the city, where they encounter a band of American treasure hunters led by the famed Egyptologist Dr. Allen Chamberlain, and guided by Beni Gabor, a cowardly former Legion soldier who served with Rick and also knows the location of the lost city.", "During the journey, the boat is invaded by Medjai soldiers who are looking for Evelyn's box and the map. The expedition manages to fight them off, but the map is lost and the boat goes up in flames, forcing the entire party to go ashore. Rick, Evelyn and Jonathan are separated from the other treasure hunters and procure camels at a nearby market. Since Rick knows the way to the city, they arrive at Hamunaptra at the same time as the other party, but due to tensions between the two groups, they start exploring the city in separate locations. The Americans discover a chest between the legs of the statue of Anubis.", "They have it opened by several of their carriers, but the chest is booby-trapped and the carriers die from an acid spray. In the meanwhile, Evelyn is looking for the Book of Amun-Ra, a solid gold book supposedly capable of taking life away. Her team discovers a tomb buried directly below the statue of Anubis. Evelyn's box turns out to function as a key that opens the tomb; inside there is a sarcophagus. Suddenly, the prison warden runs by, screaming in pain. Unbeknownst to the rest, he had found a decorative scarab, but it contained a real scarab that entered his body and ate a way into his brain. The warden knocks himself into a wall and dies instantly.", "After a quiet evening outside, Rick and Evelyn get in a romantic mood, when suddenly, both groups are attacked by the Medjai, led by a warrior named Ardeth Bay. Rick forces a stand-off by lighting a stick of dynamite and threatening to blow everyone up. Bay warns them of the evil buried in the city, and gives them one day to leave. His groups then ride out. Rather than heed his warning, the two expeditions continue to work on their respective projects. The sarcophagus is opened, and contains the gory remains of Imhotep. The team of Americans, meanwhile, open the chest, in spite of a warning on its lid that threatens to kill everyone who takes its contents. They discover the black Book of the Dead, accompanied by canopic jars carrying Anck-su-Namun's preserved organs; each of the Americans takes a jar as loot, while Dr. Chamberlain takes the book, but Beni flees the scene out of fear for the curse.", "At night, Evelyn takes the Book of the Dead from the Americans' tent; her key also fits on it. She reads a page aloud, accidentally awakening Imhotep's mummified remains. Immediately, the first plague announces itself: a swarm of locusts invades the terrain, forcing everyone inside the city. The entire group is separated into smaller parties when a giant army of scarabs breaks loose, and eats everything in its path. One of the Americans gets lost, and is attacked by Imhotep, who takes his eyes and tongue while partially regenerating his body. Evelyn also encounters Imhotep, and he seems to recognize her as Anck-Su-Namun; however, Rick shoots him down before everyone flees the catacombs. They run into Ardeth and his group of Medjai warriors again. He berates them for resuccecting Imhotep, who will now bring along death and destruction. The only thing to do is flee the city, until a way can be found to kill him again. The entire group leaves, but Beni is left behind. He also encounters Imhotep, but successfully pleads for his life, and is allowed to become his slave.", "Both groups return to Cairo. Rick and the Americans plan to leave Egypt, but Evelyn decides to stay, reasoning that releasing the curse was their fault, so they have the responsibility to stop Imhotep. That afternoon, the next plague announces itself: water turning into blood, signaling that Imhotep is nearby. The group deduces that Imhotep will go after the four men who took the Book of the Dead and the canopic jars. Beni has indeed taken Imhotep to Cairo, helping him trace the Americans. Rick and Jonathan track down the American whose eyes were stolen; they find his desiccated body, and Imhotep slowly regenerating his own. Rick tries to kill Imhotep but he is invulnerable to weapons; only the presence of a cat in the room startles him, and he flees in a dust storm. Rick returns to his quarters as the second plague starts: violent hailstorms ravage the city.", "He locks Evelyn in her room to keep her safe from Imhotep, ordering the remaining two Americans to stand guard while he and Jonathan leave to warn Dr. Chamberlain. The doctor's chamber is empty, but they witness Imhotep killing Dr. Chamberlain in the streets, taking the Black Book and releasing a swarm of flies. Imhotep proceeds to Evelyn, entering the room and consuming the body of the American on guard. He enters the sleeping Evelyn's bedroom through the keyhole by transforming into sand, and tries to kiss her. Rick, Jonathan and the remaining American enter, and scare him away by threatening him with a cat.", "The group goes to the museum, hoping that the museum curator Dr. Bey may have some answers. They are astonished to find him together with Ardeth Bay. Dr. Bey reveals to also be a member of the secret society sworn to prevent Imhotep's resurrection (which is why he purposely tried to burn the map). He theorizes that Imhotep will fears cats (the guardians of the underworld) until he is fully immortal; he also thinks that Imhotep intends to resurrect Anck-su-Namun, using Evelyn's body to regenerate it. All of a sudden, a solar eclipse occurs, so they have to make haste. Evelyn hypothesises that if the black Book of the Dead brought Imhotep back to life, the gold Book of Amun-Ra can kill the high priest once again.", "The group finds a tablet in the museum that describes the location of both books, and Evelyn deduces that the gold book must be buried beneath the statue of Horus. At that moment, a large group of natives, covered in boils and sores (the next plague) and under Imhotep's spell, surround the museum. The heroes leave the museum by car, but the remaining American is captured during the pursuit, and consumed by Imhotep. Finally cornered by his followers, the fully regenerated Imhotep offers Evelyn to come with him, in exchange for letting the others go. She agrees, but as they leave, Imhotep goes back on his words. Dr. Bey sacrifices his life by holding back the crowd of followers while the rest flee through the sewers.", "Rick, Jonathan and Ardeth enlist the help of Winston Havlock, a desillusioned WWI fighter pilot, to fly them over to Hamunaptra. Imhotep returns to Hamunaptra in a sandstorm, carrying Evelyn and Beni, pursued by Rick's plane. Imhotep uses his powers to cause a huge sandstorm, but distracted by Evelyn, he only succeeds in letting the plane make an emergency crash landing, killing only Winston. Rick, Jonathan and Ardeth enter Hamunaptra and discover a new area ful of Hamunaptra's famed treasures. They quickly get into a battle with Imhotep's resurrected mummy priests, so they make their way to the statue of Horus, where they find the Book of Amun-Ra. However, when cornered by the priests, Ardeth sacrifices himself to allow Rick and Jonathan to escape.", "Imhotep, in the meanwhile, has resurrected the mummified remains of Anck-su-Namun and is preparing to sacrifice Evelyn, when Rick and Jonathan interfere. Rick frees Evelyn from a group of mummies, while Jonathan reads an inscription on the book in order to kill Imhotep; unfortunately, this only summons a group of mummified guards, who chase after Rick, while Evelyn is attacked by the resurrected Anck-su-Namun. Jonathan succeeds in finishing the inscription, giving him command of the guards just before they kill Rick; he commands the guards to kill Anck-su-Namun. Imhotep turns his anger towards Rick, while Jonathan and Evelyn succeed in opening the Book of Amun-Ra.", "Imhotep is about to kill Rick when Evelyn recites the counter-curse. Imhotep's immortal soul is taken from him, and he becomes mortal. Rick fatally stabs him, and rapidly decaying into a mummy again, Imhotep leaves the world of the living, vowing revenge.", "Beni, who was secretly dragging treasure outside, accidentally sets off an ancient booby trap. As Hamunaptra begins to collapse into the sand, Rick, Evelyn and Jonathan race towards the exit, with Jonathan accidentally dropping the gold book. Beni remains behind, and is trapped and eaten by a swarm of flesh-eating scarabs. The heroes escape before Hamunaptra disappears in the sand. Ardeth, who has unexpectedly survived, waits for them outside and thanks them for their help.", "All three ride off into the sunset on a pair of camels laden with Beni's treasure."]},

Any possible form of dramatic intent wants drive in this simple-minded tale based upon inferior material, an account telling of Joanna Burke (Sherilyn Fenn) who has ostensibly moved over into \"the other side\" after being mowed down by a semi-trailer truck as she is saving the life of her young daughter who is about to be flattened by the same vehicle. After awakening in a hospital, Joanna is informed that she is actually Sarah Randolph, whereas Joanna Burke and her daughter do not, in fact, exist, and it falls upon bewildered Joanna to solve this puzzle of her identity, a task for which she might not have competence, and exacerbated by Sarah's being of an unpleasant sort, perhaps to the point of having strangled her eight year old son to death. A romantic thread is unsurprisingly engendered when the physician treating Joanna/Sarah, played by Thomas Gibson, is determined to become involved with her predicament, and the two struggle along together, when not embracing or seeking to avoid close attention being paid to murder suspect Sarah by a zealous police detective who seemingly has only the Randolph homicide case assigned to him. Overly discursive plot development effaces any chance of suspense being constructed, particularly as to whether or not Joanna will be able to regain her former self along with her daughter, thereby creating only weak entertainment from a film that is further stricken by a glut of risible flaws in logic and continuity, not solely within the screenplay, but additionally relating to rather queer medical and law enforcement policies and procedures."]},

Told in a highly visual style.", "The film tells the story of Mickey and Mallory (Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis) two relentless and cold blooded mass murderers who become cult heroes through the exploitation of a talk show television journalist who uses them to boost his ratings which has unexpected consequences,", "The misadventures of Mickey and Mallory: outcasts, lovers, and serial killers. They travel across Route 666 conducting psychadelic mass-slaughters not for money, not for revenge, just for kicks. Glorified by the media, the pair become legendary folk heroes; their story told by the single person they leave alive at the scene of each of their slaughters.", "Delivery boy Mickey Knox falls in love with customer Mallory Wilson. He soon helps her kill her abusive father and enabling mother, beginning their macabre journey down Route 666. Their M.O.: every few miles, they attack everyone within their site, invariably leaving only one person alive to tell the tale. The two are made famous by unscrupulous reporter Wayne Gale, as they run across the countryside, pursued by the equally sadistic Jack Scagnetti. Just before the trial, a ratings-whoring interview by the same reporter who made them famous leads to pandemonium, not just within the prison itself, but nationwide. A satire of the media, public opinion, and the modern attitude toward violence.", "Introduction", "Mickey Knox and his wife Mallory go to a roadside café in the New Mexico desert. They appear to be normal customers, with Mickey eating key lime pie and Mallory dancing to rock 'n' roll on the jukebox. A group of rednecks arrive and one begins dancing and flirting with Mallory. She encourages him for a moment, then attacks him without provocation by smashing his beer bottle as he drinks from it. A fistfight ensues, with Mallory beating the man. When the redneck's friend intervenes, Mickey cuts off one of the cowboy's fingers and stabs him with a large Bowie-style knife. Mickey and Mallory then begin killing the diner's patrons, culminating in a morbid game of \"Eeny, meeny, miny, moe\" to decide who lives and who dies among the last 2 customers. After executing their final victim, Mabel the waitress, the couple make sure the only survivor, a cook, remembers their names and promises to tell the authorities who committed the massacre before they embrace and declare their undying love for each other.", "Part I", "Mickey and Mallory are in a desert at night. Mallory is reminiscing about when they first met. A flashback shows Mickey as a butcher's deliveryman who came to the house where Mallory lived with her abusive father (Rodney Dangerfield), her neglectful mother (Edie McClurg), and her younger brother Kevin. The flashback is portrayed as a 1950s-type sitcom with a canned laughter track, the \"audience\" laughing hardest when Mallory is subjected to lewd comments and hints of molestation by her father.", "Mickey instantly falls in love with Mallory. They leave together, Mickey stealing Mallory's father's car. Mickey is arrested and imprisoned for grand theft auto, but he subsequently escapes a horse work farm during a tornado and returns to Mallory's house. The two kill her father by beating him with a jack handle and drowning him in a fish tank, then burn her mother alive in bed. They spare her ten-year-old brother, Mallory telling him that he is free. They leave to rapturous applause from the \"audience.\"", "Mickey and Mallory get \"married\" on the side of a bridge, exchanging snake wedding bands, cutting their palms and mixing their blood which drips down into the river below. They drive to a motel for the night. After watching television, they begin to have sex until Mickey is distracted by a female hostage. Furious with Mickey's notion that they have a threesome, Mallory drives to a nearby gas station where she flirts with the mechanic. They begin to have sex on the hood of a car, but Mallory is angered by his over-aggressive oral sex and shoots him to death. Back at the motel, Mickey rapes the hostage.", "Part II", "The pair continue their killing-spree (which bears similarities to Bonnie and Clyde and the Starkweather-Fugate murders), ultimately claiming 48 victims along Route 666 in New Mexico, Colorado and Utah. Pursuing them are two characters who see the murderers as a chance to achieve fame for themselves.", "The first is a policeman, Detective Jack Scagnetti, who seems particularly fascinated by Mallory. Scagnetti is already a well-known personality, a published author, whose book \"Scagnetti on Scagnetti\" is a best-seller within law enforcement. Scagnetti has a lifelong obsession with mass murderers after witnessing his mother being shot and killed by Charles Whitman in Austin, Texas when he was eight. Despite his heroic facade, he is actually sociopathic, strangling a prostitute to death in a hotel room after he tries to get too rough with her & she scratches his face.", "The second follower of the killers is journalist Wayne Gale, an Australian who hosts a show called American Maniacs, which profiles mass murderers. Various clips of Mickey and Mallory are shown, with Gale acting outraged on-screen as he details the pair's crimes, although off-air he clearly regards them as a fantastic way of increasing his show's ratings. It is Gale who is primarily responsible for elevating Mickey and Mallory to hero status, with his show featuring interviews with people around the world expressing their admiration for the killers.", "Mickey and Mallory become lost in the desert and encounter Warren Red Cloud, a Navajo Indian, and his pre-adolescent grandson. After the two fall asleep, the Navajo, hoping to expel the demon he perceives in Mickey, begins chanting beside the fire, invoking nightmares in Mickey about his abusive parents. Mickey wakes up in a rage and fatally shoots the Navajo before he realizes what he is doing. It is the first time Mallory and Mickey feel guilty for a murder. While fleeing from the scene through the desert, they stray into a field of rattlesnakes and are both bitten.", "They drive to a drugstore to find snake antivenin, but the pharmacist sets off the silent alarm before Mickey kills him. Police cars pull up. Mallory is captured immediately and is subsequently beaten by the sadistic and brutish police. A gunfight breaks out between Mickey and the others. When Scagnetti arrives, he tells Mickey that unless he surrenders he'll cut off Mallory's breasts, slashing her a few times with his knife. Mickey gives up his gun, but he attacks Scagnetti with a knife. The police use tazers on him, and the scene ends with Mickey and Mallory being beaten by a group of vengeful policemen while Scagnetti excitedly looks on.", "Part III", "The story picks up one year later. The homicidal couple have been imprisoned -- a trial is only hinted at in footage provided by Gale. The two have killed several people in prison, including inmates and guards. Mallory herself has murdered her psychiatrist. Both are due to be moved to a mental hospital after being declared insane. Scagnetti arrives at the prison and encounters Dwight McClusky, the sleazy and abusive warden of the prison. The two devise a plan to murder the two criminals: McClusky will arrange for Scagnetti to be the driver for the Knox's transfer. Alone with the pair, Scagnetti will kill them, claiming they tried to escape.", "Wayne Gale has persuaded Mickey to agree to a live interview, to air immediately after the Super Bowl. Mallory is held in solitary confinement elsewhere in the prison, awaiting her transport to the mental hospital. In preparation for his TV appearance, Mickey shaves his head.", "During the interview, Mickey gives a speech about how murder provides enlightenment and declares himself a \"natural born killer.\" His words inspire the other inmates (who are watching the interview on TV in the recreation room) and incite them to riot.", "When word of the riot reaches McClusky, he orders the interview terminated over Gale's violent protests. Mickey is left alone with Gale, the TV crew and several guards. Using a lengthy joke as a diversion, Mickey overpowers a guard and grabs his shotgun and kills most of the guards and some of Gale's crew. Mickey takes the survivors hostage, leading them through the prison riot, intending to reunite with Mallory. Gale follows, excitedly giving a live television report as people are beaten and killed around him. Inmates torture and murder prisoners and guards alike.", "During the interview and outbreak of the riot, Scagnetti is in Mallory's cell, attempting to seduce her. Mallory plays along for a short time, then attacks Scagnetti violently, smashing his face against the wall and breaking his nose. The guards and Scagnetti subdue her.", "Still live on national television, Mickey bursts into Mallory's cell and engages in a brief Mexican standoff with Scagnetti, eventually feigning a concession. Mallory then approaches Scagnetti from behind and slashes his throat with a shank. Mickey then reveals that the shotgun was unloaded, much to Scagnetti's horror. Mallory picks up Scagnetti's loaded gun and kills him.", "They continue to escape through the riot-torn prison, with two guards as hostages. The remainder of Gale's TV crew are killed. Gale himself snaps and begins to shoot at the guards, claiming to be \"alive for the first time in [his] life\" while calling his wife and telling her he's been cheating on her with another woman.", "After being rescued by a mysterious prisoner named Owen Traft, the trio of Mickey, Mallory and Gale run into Warden McClusky and a heavily armed posse of guards. Cavanaugh, the guard they'd taken hostage, is shot to death by McClusky's men. In retaliation, Mallory shoots Gale thru his hand & they retreat, taking cover in a blood-splattered shower room. Gale calls his wife and tells her he is leaving her. He calls his mistress to tell her he will see her later, however, she hangs up on him.", "McClusky threatens to storm the shower room. Mickey in turn, duct-tapes shotguns to the necks of Gale & a guard, Homolka, threatening to kill both on live TV. The prisoners walk out the front door. McClusky and his guards are massacred by hordes of inmates who burst into the area. They tear McClusky apart, cutting his head off and displaying it on a spike (a shot removed from the theatrical showing and seen in the director's cut only).", "After the escape, Owen is never seen or mentioned again. Mickey and Mallory steal a van and kill the last guard. Escaping to a rural location, they give a final interview to Wayne Gale before, much to his surprise and horror, they tell him he must also die. Gale futilely attempts to change their minds, finally appealing to their trademark practice of leaving one witness to tell the tale. Mickey inform hims they are leaving his camera as the witness. Gale accepts his fate and extends his arms as if crucified as they shoot him numerous times while his unattended camera continues to roll.", "The couple are shown several years later in an RV, with Mickey driving and Mallory (who is pregnant) watching their two children play."]},

Not really, but what's done is done. Lords actually briefly discussed this film in her autobiography \"Underneath It All,\" and mentioned it being a strange and amusing job she did, and I'm sure it was. It's also one of only a handful of non-pornographic films she did before the underage porn scandal hit the news. Though this (a specialty BDSM tape) caters to a similar adult audience, there's nothing hardcore about it and it pretty much fits in with all the R-rated exploitation films both Lords and Bauer would later make. Bauer herself was one of the top bondage models of the 1980s (under the names Pia Sands, Kim Bittner and other aliases) and was even crowned \"Miss Bondage World\" a number of years, so what goes on in this film is certainly nothing new for her.", "So how's THIS for a plot... Wealthy flagrant line-flubber Boris (Pierre Banus) and his cowboy-hat-wearing colleague Jay (John Graham) run a profitable business kidnapping random women and then turning them into horses! Well, they're not literally turned into horses, they're just shipped off to a farm where whip-wielding Mitzi (Bunnie White) forces the girls to dress in bondage gear, fastens them to a horse walker and makes them walk or run circles around a track as she barks out various orders (\"prance!\" \"gallop!\"). Vicki (Bauer), Daphne (Lords) and Kim (porno actress Lois Ayres) aren't having it though and quietly plot their escape. Maybe they're sick of being walked around on leashes and having to sleep on the barn floor. ", "Secret cameras are apparently everywhere and the footage from the farm is being sent to a yacht where Boris and Jay are breaking in a few new girls so they'll be ready for their strenuous new lives as ponies. One girl dressed is a full-body leather outfit and breathing apparatus is shown numerous times whining and squirming on a bed. They also find Marilyn (Crystal Breeze) stranded at sea, invite her on-board, drug her drink and then tie her up after she passes out. When she comes to she learns what they plan on doing with her and hilariously screams \"I'm gonna be a horse?!\" Meanwhile, Bauer, Lords and the other girl manage to untie themselves and escape, but they're found and brought back to the farm just as the scuba girl and Breeze are brought in. The video then abruptly ends, but don't worry, there's a sequel - PONY GIRL TWO: THE STORY CONTINUES!", "To some this might be degrading in the extreme, but it's so badly acted and silly I seriously couldn't see anyone really being offended by it. I didn't find it the least bit erotic either, but I'm sure some people out there would. Many of the takes are extremely long and the film has the expected camcorder production values and terrible acting. Bauer is pretty funny at times though, and even lets out an audible laugh when she's forced to \"canter.\" She and Lords don't have much dialogue, but I guess it's hard to talk when you spend half your scenes with a steel bar in your mouth."]},

Webb to writer Bennett Cohen, as the pair dusted this one off in 1940 and remade it as \"Pioneer Days\", with Jack Randall replacing the original's Jack Perrin. By 1940, Jack Perrin was playing henchmen and bit roles in many of the films Harry S. Webb made at Metropolitan (with Bob Steele) and Monogram (with Jack Randall) and was in a couple of the Monogram/Webb/Randall films, but didn't suffer the indignity of doing an uncredited part in a remake of a film he had originally starred in.", "But others from the original-source film also appeared in the remake, although Nelson McDowell was the only one who played the same role in \"Pioneer Days\" as he had in \"Rawhide Mail.\" And every bit as annoying in the remake as he is in \"Rawhide Mail.\" Jimmy Aubrey and Robert Walker were both back, which is no surprise since both had worked in nearly every film Harry S. Webb was associated with from 1930-1941; Lafe McKee appeared in a lesser role ,as did Richard/Dick Cramer who was now an uncredited bartender but had been the lead villain in \"Rawhide Mail.\" Fame fleeted fast in the world of B-westerns.", "Starlight the Wonder Horse,who was credited in more movies during the 1925-37 period then any other screen hoss, including Ken Maynard's \"Tarzan\", was now, alive or dead, grazing in greener pastures, so \"Pioneer Days\" star Jack Randall was riding a different horse. Really different, since his steed in the previous eight films for Monogram, was Rusty the Wonder Horse, but the producer for those was Robert Emmett Tansey and he had been replaced by Harry S. Webb for the concluding seven films in the Randall series. Evidently, Rusty the Wonder Horse, was working under an exclusive contract to producer Tansey, who took Rusty along to be in the series he was producing starring Tom Keene. So Randall was now riding an uncredited brown-and-white pinto named Tex. Tex had fewer credited film roles than any other horse in movies, but his uncredited back was ridden by more different players than any horse in films;Jack Randall, Tim Holt, Bob Steele, Charles King, Iron Eyes Cody, John King, Raymond Hatton, Vester Pegg, Art Davis, Jack Ingram,Loretta Young, Evelyn Finley and Ona Munson. Tex was an-equal opportunity horse who didn't care who rode him, whether it was the star or villain, male or female. But later, Tex got a break,of sorts, when he was purchased by Jimmy Wakely, who rode him in that performer's first 12-starring films at Monogram. Of sorts is used because Wakley changed his name to \"Lucky.\" And Wakely got himself a new horse in his 13th film , and gave Lucky away to the \"Queen for a Day\" radio program which gave him away to a contestant as a prize. It is unknown who rode Lucky after that.Well, it may be known to the people who rode him but not here.", "\"Rawhide Mail\" was one of the best films Jack Perrin starred in at Reliable Pictures. Don't scoff if the only Jack Perrin/Reliable film you've seen is \"Rawhide Mail.\" See the others first. But \"Pioneer Days\" is in the bottom tier of the westerns made by Jack Randall. That isn't because Harry Webb's limited-directing skills had declined any with the passing of six years; It is because some of Randalls' previous films had been directed by the likes of Robert North Bradbury, Spencer Gordon Bennett and Alan James.", "\"Rawhide Mail\", as a title was close to being a misnomer; most of the plot centered around the acquisition of (honestly and dishonestly) and the operation of (honestly and dishonestly)two saloons. But it was a golden film for those who played barflies. Notice the term used was not \"patron\". The people who made and wrote western films referred to the role as a Barfly or Saloon Extra or Barroom Extra. Patrons can be found as café and night club extras watching Fred and Ginger dance.Usually sissy types."]},

The production is very elaborate, containing a number of very picturesque settings to illustrate the lines quoted from the Elegy.

Of the films for which she appeared, Henie never had \"skates\" among her movie titles. Yet SILVER SKATES, which stars Kenny Baker and Patricia Morison, features Monogram's very own ice skating specialty, Belita, labeled in the opening credits as \"star of the ice.\" While the Henie musicals produced by 20th Century-Fox centered around her mostly in plot and ice skating portions of the film, SILVER SKATES shares Belita with other specialties of the day as youngsters Irene Dare and Danny Shaw doing their own ice skating techniques, George Stuart, Eugene Turner and Jo Ann Dean playing themselves. There's also some time out antics by comedy team of Frick and Frack whose routines may have one think of the Ritz Brothers, but being no threat to that team nor any other comedy team for that matter as a result.", "The story, set in the Broadway district of New York City, finds Claire Thomas (Patricia Morison), producer of \"Silver Skates Ice Revue,\" may go out of business after her star ice skating attraction, Belita (Belita) finishes her two week engagement to marry Tom (Henry Wadsworth), a Chicago businessman. Claire, who's loved by Danny Donovan (Kenny Baker), refuses to marry the singer in the show until she can clear herself of back debts. Thanks to Eddie (Frank Faylen), a stage hand, who, after receiving his two week notice, spreads a rumor that Belita secretly loves Danny, and because of that, feels that this would start of a romance that have Belita remain in the revue, thus keeping his job. During the complications which finds Danny engaged to two women at the same time, Claire encounters a little Dutch girl named Katrina (Irene Dare) in the lobby of her Broadmoor Arms apartment. It is learned that Katrina not only has gotten separated from Miss Martin (Ruth Lee) of the Netherlands Relief Commiittee, but turns out to be an orphan awaiting news about her Uncle Conrad Humperdinck, a former skater in Claire's shows. Learning Uncle Conrad has gone to serve in the Army, and her parents killed in an air raid, Claire assumes responsibility for the child with the intent on adopting her. Complications occur as Claire tries to induce Danny to marry her, only to learn about his \"engagement\" to Belita. Other members of the cast include the ever reliable Joyce Compton (Lucille, Eddie's girlfriend); Paul McVey (Roscoe Hayes, the booking agent); John Maxwell (Blake); Ruby Dandridge (The Maid); and Ted Fio Rito and his Orchestra.", "With the plot being as ordinary and secondary as forties musicals go, the song interludes, particularly the ice skating portions choreographed by Dave Gould, certainly highlight this production. With pleasing music and lyrics by David Oppenheim and Roy Ingraham, song numbers include: \"Lovely Lady\" (sung by Kenny Baker, skated by Belita); Dream sequence skating number with Irene Dare with Holland setting; \"Cowboy Joe\" (sung by chorus, skated by Danny Shaw); \"Can't You Hear Me Calling From the Mountain?\" (performed by Frick and Frack); \"A Boy Like You, a Girl Like Me\" (Sung by Kenny Baker and Patricia Morison); \"Hollywood Victory Party\" (skating sequence by Irene Dare and Danny Shaw); \"Dancing on Top of the World\" (sung by chorus, skated by Irene Dare); \"Love is a Beautiful Song\" (sung by Baker); and finale, \"Sing a Song of the Sea\" (Baker, Belita, chorus).", "With Monogram Pictures having a reputation of being second features of low-budget production value, SILVER SKATES comes as a surprise for anyone expecting very little. Though not quite 20th Century-Fox nor Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, it is an interesting effort in Monogram's attempt on rising itself to better quality films. Though not quite Academy Award winning material, the film overall is an entertaining 73 minutes from its ten minute ice skating opening to grand scale final, with a little in-between amusements of amusing wisecracks and some hit and miss comedy. For anyone familiar with Patricia Morison, it's interesting finding her playing against her bad girl/ femme fatal type for decent, caring woman for a change. Her musical participation with Kenny Baker comes as a sheer reminder of the crooning style of Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler from his thirties musicals, yet something of a disappointment listening to Morison singing to an obviously dubbed vocalization. The star attraction, Belita, may not a good actress but somewhat forgivable in terms of being a newcomer to films who presents herself well enough as an agreeable new screen personality.", "Virtually forgotten by cast, title and reputation due to lack of television broadcasts since the 1950s or so, and never distributed to home video, SILVER SKATES was resurrected on cable TV's Turner Classic Movies in May of 1997 as part of its then monthly viewer's movie request. After that sole broadcast, it wasn't repeated again until many years later starting in October 2014. SILVER SKATES is definitely a \"B\" class musical regardless of its \"A\" production effort, but a worthy rediscovery as ice skating musicals go. (**1/2)"]},

It's also problematic that her father only looks about ten years her senior (which was exactly the case, in terms of the actors' ages), and that as written Montalban's character isn't terribly sympathetic by current standards. He goes from being a belligerent barker or orders to a self-justifying marital cheat, and frankly the film does not come up with a transporting enough atmosphere to pull its melodrama off without getting somewhat clunky. Still, the ending is more graceful than one expects, and the movie as a whole is well-made.

It's unusual in our youth-saturated culture to have a film which sympathises with a parental figure, but Dad is almost zombi-like as he stares into space, dreaming, crushed, disappointed, sad.  The scene where he slowly, unansweringly replaces the receiver blaring with an irate ex-wife, explains everything - he is the kind of paralysingly passive person who can do nothing to change his life, and only alienates others to fury.", "His son plays guitar, is casually destructive and always sponging.  On 3.33 a.m., the exact time of his 18th birthday, he awaits the expected special gift, and is presented with a bill for a quarter of a million dollars for upkeep, allowances, presents etc.  Dad throws him out and won't see him again until Chris has bought his dream boat.", "This might seem a monstrous abrogation of parental responsibility, but we feel a great deal of amused sympathy for this pained, neglected man, and his action does have, unwittingly, the desired effect.  It is clear that he is close to break down, and it is painful to watch his speedy decline as the only thing left for him, his son, disappears.", "In an effort to raise funds, Chris answers a newspaper notice advertising for sons.  In a rundown shack which seems to boast Gothic interiors he finds a dying woman who has somehow let down her own son, and promises boys of his age a bequest for company.  When Chris arrives, his predecessor runs fleeing from the house, making us fear the worst; but Ms. Crabb's understandable grouchiness and insults soon give way to the pains of remorse, and the more physical rattles of death.  As if to alert us, she reads a book on Rembrandt, and this section is shot in a brooding darkness autumnally lit as in that master's paintings, an eerie combination of death and an ungraspable spirituality.", "It's rare to see a short tackle so many themes - parents and children; coming of age; mid-life crisis; death; dreams and reality etc.  The character triangle of reconciled men and  dying woman might seem misogynistic, but the very lack of female input seems to account for the sterility of the men's lives, if only to clean up their mess."]},

But alas Shauna committed suicide so in this sequel they replaced Shauna with the new Queen of Porn Traci Lords. Now we all know what happened in July 1986 but before she was outed as underage Traci dominated the porn world. Her videos outsold all other starlets and she earned BIG$ despite her claims in her 2003 autobiography Underneath it All that she made $35K to $40. This figure was verifiably untrue.", "John Leslie plays the initial agent who invites Traci on to his boat for a \"meeting\". Before that Leslie enjoys the delectable Heather Wayne in the shower and locker room floor of his club. Leslie's driver/ass't played by Ron Jeremy calls Traci and then hands the phone to Leslie who makes the appointment with her. Traci hangs up and proceeds to tell her lesbian bedmate that she has a new agent. The guy that handled Suzie Mitchell. Traci and Laurie Smith are naked and Laurie proceeds to lick and suck every part of Traci's magnificent body.", "Once on the boat, after a brief audition of her voice, it's time to audition Traci's true talents. With Jeremy and Bunny Blue making out on deck Leslie removes the clothing of a very willing Traci. Current digitalization of this movie provides terrific pixilation so you really see this woman/child in all her fabulous beauty. Leslie gets down to action with Traci and we see all her skills. Fellatio with gusto, missionary and doggie Traci leaves her audience wanting more of her.", "And more they get. Later Traci has a musical jam session with guitarist Joey Silvera. While they talk and he plays Traci daydreams what it would be like to have sex on a boat with Joey. The dream sequence does take us to a boat cruising near Catalina Island but private enough so these two porn legends can sex it up in private in the sun and cool breeze off the island. Traci is positively awesome here. She writhes in enjoyment while Joey has his manhood inside her. Her breasts never looked better. Large, full, firm, and with her nipples reacting to the coolness of the weather she goes at it in every position with Joey. For the \"money shot\" Traci leads Joey to the front of the boat. If you recall the great scene from Titanic where Kate Winslet is on the edge of the front of the ship and Leonardo DiCaprio holds her from behind...well, this was the precursor to that. Traci is buck naked at the front of the boat while Joey is behind her holding onto her while his member pumps her furiously until he comes on her ass and back. What made Traci so compelling? It wasn't just her fully formed body and youthful beauty topped off by her large firm breasts but her noises were signature as well. Finally though it was her total enthusiasm topped off by what she did in almost every hetero scene she did. When the guy would come Traci would grab the guy's penis and squeeze every drop of love juice out of it while licking it and sucking it. She would also take her hand and rub his love liquid on her backside and or scoop some of it and put it in her mouth so as to taste the guy. All in all very erotic.", "There are other scenes that resonate. Leslie and Jeremy get taken out of town and stripped and left to get home by themselves. They happen upon a nudist colony for women and see them playing volleyball. I mean talk about every guy's fantasy huh? They have sex with the girls and then leave to see about getting back to town. They happen upon a brothel where they each get laid. Leslie beds Ginger Lynn looking her usual cute tight bodied self. She services Leslie very well. The rarely seen but gorgeous and tiny April May (Collette Marin) takes Jeremy to her room. April was a smallish girl with very large breasts that were simply very alluring. In the scene it is obvious Jeremy's schlong is way too big for April to take in all the way. But the scene works as she first teases him by rubbing his member on her breasts and nipples and then they go doggie and then missionary before he explodes on her. Eventually Traci gets her singing gig as an old rich power musical exec decides he will take on Traci's career. And that is how Suzie Superstar II ends."]},

George Adamson (played by Richard Harris) is a wildlife conservationist in Kenya that specializes in the re-release of lions back into the wild. Tony Fitzjohn (played by John Michie) is a drifter that floats from job to job in Africa and somehow ends up being hired as Adamson's assistant. This chance encounter turned out to change Fitzjohn's life forever. The story focuses on Adamson's plight of running his lion release program and the politics involved during a time when the Kenyan government is in a state of unrest. The film shows the relationship that evolves between Adamson and Fitzjohn and does so through the eyes of Fitzjohn. This particular movie focuses on the time from when Fitzjohn is hired to when Fitzjohn takes over Adamson's life work in 1989, a span of 18 years. There is very little about the actual release program itself but rather focuses on Adamson as a person and what plights he faces. Thrown in this mix, is the problem that Adamson faces as the Kenyan government threatens to shut down his operations and put and end to his program. He must deal with this issue as well as handle poaching problems occurring in the area.", "There have been many movies made in or about Africa but this film has a very different feel to it. Gone are the bright colors and crystal clear pictures. This film truly has the feel of a documentary. It is frequently very dusty and the actors always seemed to be covered in dirt and grime. In addition, the picture is not always in focus (either that or the dust swirls around so much that it dulls everything) that it adds an element of reality to the movie. You can almost feel the grit in your mouth.", "Richard Harris plays Adamson wonderfully and he looks amazingly similar to the real Adamson. As to how accurately he portrays the real Adamson, I don't know but his actual acting performance was incredible. This is the first time I have ever seen Harris but he definitely puts his best foot forward. John Michie plays Fitzjohn equally well and the audience gets a real sense of respect and admiration from him as his relationship with Adamson develops. What makes these performances all the more impressive is that most of the scenes with the lions are done with both actors and lions together in the same shot...and in close proximity to each other. Some of the mauling scenes looking amazingly real too...maybe a bit too real. Some of the other scenes with other animals are quite graphic too and a bit on the hard side to watch. The introduction of Adamson's wife, Joy was a bit weak. It wasn't fully developed and left a lot of questions. From what I know of their relationship, it seemed to be closer than what was portrayed but I'm not expert so I can't really comment on that part of it but in my opinion, they could have removed Joy Adamson's involvement in this movie and it would have been just as effective.", "Overall, I thought this movie was fantastic but you leave the theatre with a heavy heart. The lions are real and the reactions to them seem genuine. It is a bit graphic in some cases but it is definitely worth the time to see. Keep in mind that this is based on real life accounts of both George Adamson and Tony Fitzjohn and therefore doesn't mean that the ending is going to be happy. In fact, it leaves you thinking about a lot of things that we as a human race allow to occur. > A"]},

The aftermath disaster. The embarrassment to the government. The subsequent writing and re-writing of history and the fascination for writers, podcasters, and nighttime TV hosts to hear her story. There is her side. There is the side of the porn industry. And recent podcasters Lili Anolik and Ashley West do a fantastic job of trying to cover all sides of the story with the ultimate question going unanswered...Who ratted out Traci?.... Many theories abound, but listen to the podcast entitled Once Upon a Time in the Valley to hear them all. Well worth the time.", "In this venue Traci is interviewed by Paul Thomas, known in the industry as PT. Thomas speaks with the bikini clad Traci on a couch as he asks her about the men and women she has worked with and how they played into her life. Tom Byron, Mark Wallace, Herschel Savage, Craig Roberts, and Blake Palmer get to sample the wonderous goods Traci Lords brought to each movie she shot. The women in the movie were Gina Carrera and Raven. These scenes were shot in other movies and or loops and incorporated into this feature.", "As the movie proceeds Traci begins to shed some of her bikini, much to the delight of PT. As she removes her bikini top PT stares at Traci's large and inviting tits and seemingly uncomfortably tells Traci and the audience \"those are some beautiful breasts you have.\" Aren't her breasts beautiful\"?\" he asks the viewer.", "The film quality is not great and I imagine if any website decides to do a complete catalog restoration of Traci's work they'll take digitization and make them HD and or higher quality.", "Traci's scenes are all extremely hot and her improv work showed the innate talent this underaged teen had for the camera. There seemingly isn't a situation presented where Traci doesn't dominate. From her first scene where Byron is undressing (making the scene a sort of audition for Traci) and he says she may have the assets for the business. A much less confidant and perhaps uncomfortable teenager might have been a little off her game as the young stud Byron begins to paw at her tube top. Yet Traci pulls back a bit to remove the tube top herself while she preens and says \"Do you really think I have the assets\"? People, even Stevie Wonder could see Traci HAD the assets! Her lesbian scene with porn vet Raven Touchstone was really hot. They seemed to enjoy one another very much. Her scene with Herschel Savage was also extremely good. Traci didn't work that much with Savage but each time they did they meshed sexually very well. Herschel too, one could tell, was enamored with the young starlets full 36D bosoms and makes mention of her beautiful breasts, which he proceeds to pay a lot of eye and mouth attention to as she writhes in ecstasy. Tom Byron is the only male actor in this film to have an encore scene with Traci. It's a setup where Byron and Gina Carrera start to go at it when Traci walks in to find her \"boyfriend\" cheating on her. Here, the young starlet shows her improv abilities. She delivers her lines in a manner which suggests both Tom and Gina are caught by surprise. And in her own way of demonstrating that she, Traci, regarded herself as the prime piece of pussy any man or woman would want she offers Tom \"a goodbye interlude\". Soooooo hot!!! You may have wondered if PT gets to bone with the well endowed feline Traci on the couch. By now Traci has removed her bikini bottom and is completely naked sitting by PT. He asks her whom she would like to work with and she names a few actors and of course PT. He reacts likes he's surprised and assures Traci he can make that happen. They have quite a good scene as we get the full view of all of Traci's wonderous talents and physical assets.", "For any fan of Traci Lords this is a must see movie. Anyone trying to understand what made Traci such a compelling performer in this genre of films I assure you if you see this movie the compilation of scenes will give you a good start to understanding the phenomenon that was Traci Lords and why even 35+ years later she is still regarded as one of the greatest, if not the greatest, talents to ever perform in XXX. It isn't just the story of how she was underaged. There were plenty of pornstars thru the years that ponied up phony proof while they were under 18. It wasn't only her unique sounds while having sex as many women/girls made their own signature sounds. It wasn't even Traci's fully developed body as a 15+ year old cause there have been others. It's the idea Traci Lords literally was the most demanded performer in video stores. She had a certain appeal to the camera, therefore the viewer. She became the image of what pure sex and seduction looked and sounded like. And then of course the aftermath was an entangled crime story begging the question who were the real victims and who benefitted most from Traci's time in and out of porn?"]},

I haven't seen an NFB production in quite a while when I suddenly saw this one pop up on TV and decided I'd watch it. Major Ben Wheeler was a Canadian doctor serving in Singapore when the Japanese captured him in 1942. The movie recounts, through the pages of his diary, his experiences as a POW, and it's both very sobering and very powerful.", "What I particularly liked was the way four different kinds of productions were put together to create an essentially seamless story. Wheeler's diary (narrated by Donald Sutherland) was accompanied with dramatized scenes of life in the camp. The story of the camp was supplemented by what I call \"talking head\" segments - interviews with survivors of the camp - and with what I have to assume (based on the obvious level of the starvation of the POWs) was actual archival footage of the camps. Then, interspersed with all that were snippets of Wheeler's life and family back home in Canada (both before and after the war) in segments narrated by his daughter Ann, who was also co-producer, director and writer. It was very well done and offered a sobering view of life in the Japanese POW camps. One thing I appreciated was at least an attempt to look at the harsh, inhuman treatment of the POWs from the Japanese perspective. It was pointed out near the beginning that, in the Japanese culture of that day, a Japanese soldier would kill himself before being taken prisoner, and so they tended to look at soldiers who allowed themselves to be taken prisoner as less than human. Then, at the end, it was noted that many of the Japanese guards at the camp did, in fact, commit suicide rather than become prisoners as the Americans arrived to liberate the camps. I'm certainly not trying to justify the treatment of POWs by the Japanese, but certainly it does have to be seen from the perspective of that culture to be fully understood, and that's often a perspective we fail to see.", "There were a lot of \"talking head\" segments - which I'm not really enamoured of - but I still thought this was very well done. 8/10"]},

Collections thereof like BALL BUSTERS and DIRTY GIRLS can't help but feel feather-weight next to the director's far more elaborate classics from the previous decade, revered romps he seemed now quite content to merely serialize, albeit with well above average results as proved by BABYFACE 2 and PRETTY PEACHES 2 & 3. Sexually, the Old Master never lost his golden touch though, even when resorting to the \"grab bag\" approach that inevitably marks most of these so-called \"loop carriers\", a format perhaps not invented but certainly perfected by Howard Ziehm with movies like HONEYPIE, HOT COOKIES and SWEET CAKES.", "Narrated in disarming airhead fashion by fly by night starlet Jill Ferrari (who appeared all too briefly in movies like Lawrence T. Cole's atmospheric HOUSE OF STRANGE DESIRES and John Seeman's cult film waiting to happen MISSING PIECES), WILD THINGS is comprised of a series of sexual scenarios attempting to fulfill the promise held by the title. Things get off to a rocky start with what is undoubtedly the weakest segment as the happy home of Patti Petite and Billy Dee is invaded by escaped convicts Ashley Grant (also in the director's scorching LET'S GET IT ON) and Mauvais DeNoire, an overlooked black starlet who made a touching contribution to Sam Weston's RED GARTER. A chemistry deficit keeps this sequence from firing on all cylinders. Fortunately, there's better in store. Kimberly Carson provides a sympathetic miniature as a woman seeking the help from sex surrogate Herschel Savage to attain the conception her husband's incapable of, leading to a tender tryst to the strains of \"Danny Boy\", inspired scoring to say the least ! Curvy Tess Ferre (the girl in the weird opening scene of Paul G. Vatelli's uneven BEVERLY HILLS COX) and Buck Adams attempt to alleviate marital boredom through ever more outlandish sexual positions while another betrothed pair, bountiful Robin Cannes (who played a memorable part  lusting after brother Craig Roberts  in Kirdy Stevens' sublime TABOO IV) and John Leslie, engage in burglar and victim role-playing to the same end.", "The best stuff is saved for last with an all time Sapphic scorcher between superstar Christy Canyon and achingly pretty Ali Moore, star of Jerome Bronson's amusing Getting' READY, that could serve as a demo piece for fledgling pornographers on how to shoot and edit this type of material for maximum knockout effect. The remaining sequence depends on which version of the movie you happen to come across. Originally, De Renzy had crafted a terrific remake of his legendary '70s loop PAROCHIAL PASSION PRINCESS with Traci Lords in all too appropriate Catholic schoolgirl outfit making horny gardener Jamie Gillis  whose filthy interior monologue really makes the scene  a very happy man indeed. As everyone's well aware by now, Lords was revealed as being under age when she made most of her subsequently retracted and/or re-edited romps. Therefore, the director replaced it with an almost equally scalding set-up involving Brazilian bombshell Elle Rio (memorable in Fred Lincoln's SHE COMES IN COLORS) who has inadvertently invited both of her boyfriends, Jon Martin and Tom Byron, on the same day with the guys teaching her a lesson in front and rear double penetration. While I'm slightly inclined towards Traci's tease number, it would be hard to deny that De Renzy went to great lengths to make up for its enforced absence. If, like me, you're lucky enough to come across the French video release (as LE SEXE SAUVAGE) however, you will find that you can have your cake and eat it too as this is the only version to the best of my knowledge that actually includes both loops.

She's the daughter of snooty socialites Arnold (Alan Marlow, the unforgettable womanizer forced to endure women's plight through reincarnation in the curvaceous body of Darby Lloyd Rains from Roberta Findlay's excellent ANGEL # 9) and Helen (Marlene Willoughby) whose appearance-obsessed world is rocked to its very foundation by Linda's alleged abduction by a gang of bikers. The distraught Helen calls upon private dick Murray Kaplan (David Joseph a/k/a Leo Lovemore, who was in Costello's hugely enjoyable LOVE BUS, which he helmed as \"Oscar Tripe\"), a precursor to Dan McCord and just as incompetent, who patiently listens to the woman recounting how she spied on her daughter fooling around with her boyfriend Bobby (Costello's customary supporting role) as a prelude to their own three-way with his secretary. While neither the actress portraying Linda nor especially Costello makes a credible teenager, they do wind up having the hottest action in this movie, underscored by a Mike Oldfield track from his Tubular Bells album the director would revisit for the Hillary Summers Broadway audition bit in his lavish 1981 sex through the ages epic PANDORA'S MIRROR. ", "As this is just a one hour movie, Kaplan traces the bikers in record time only to learn that Linda joined them out of her own free will, the ransom note solely concocted by her devious parents who were only concerned about what their friends might think of them. Their reputation soiled, the gang (led rather unfathomably by drippy Bobby) break into the Dunraven mansion and thoroughly force themselves upon mom and dad with a nugget of father-daughter incest and a reddening of Helen's posterior with the cat o'nine tails for good measure. While this does not bring the errant maiden back to her family, it does somehow rekindle the parents' passion for one another. Huh ? ", "Adhering to a mind-boggling logic of its own, this cheerful cheapie gets by on a happy go lucky attitude, aided in no small measure by the tongue in cheek performance of the inimitable Marlene Willoughby. Tall, slender and alluringly androgynous, looking like an Andy Warhol superstar with that unruly shock of teased black hair (imagine Holly Woodlawn if she had been born a girl), with the sassiest line delivery since Mae West, Willoughby added an intentional layer of camp to every one of her performances whether the material warranted it or not. She would eventually graduate from some of the most intense '70s roughies (DOMINATRIX WITHOUT MERCY, WATERPOWER) to '80s big budget class acts such as Cecil Howard's FOXTROT."]},

The two go back to his place and have a romantic tryst, with Betty turning back to prostitution to support his vagabond lifestyle.", "Somehow (the film never specifies), Betty's new engagement with her work seems to confer the impression she's raking in the dough, so it's not long before Astyr's money-grubbing sister (Jenny Baxter) is drugging her with LSD and attempting to ply favors, both monetary and otherwise. When the sister discovers Betty isn't actually a member of the monied elite, she flies into a rage, which happens to coincide with the arrival of her two \"business associates.\" Given there are only five people in the cast, I'll let you take a crack at who those are...", "Plenty of porn is unambitious, but BETTY BABY barely even makes sense - the whole monetary component is simply confusing, suggesting the film was improv-ed on the spot (probably over the course of an afternoon) and not really thought through. Sex is serviceable though uninvolving, spackled over with numerous stock-sounding tracks from Mahavishnu Orchestra.

The target of the gossip is Ward's character Gary, but the nature of the gossip is rigorously withheld. It's basically a long, drawn-out shaggy dog story, of the type the Coen Brothers currently insist upon, that will either turn off or, in my case, infuriate the viewer.", "This conundrum is the result of a basic defect endemic to the hardcore porn genre as a whole. Porn films are not \"about\" anything -sure, in the Golden Era of the '70s there were many titles that had stories attaining various levels of interest, but now as in the pre-feature film days of stags & loops, narrative/story has nothing to do with it. Porn is essentially a vignette medium -its prime directive being to arouse the audience. This is not to be confused with political cinema (or Michael Moore's own cottage industry genre), where the prime directive is to provoke the audience.", "So the semblance or chimera of a storyline has been appended to the otherwise pointless footage of this film, in a vain attempt to hide the void that is pure porn. This might fool the type of latter-day \"historian\"/hack writing liner notes for a video company like SWV or AHC, but I'm confident the horny viewer back in the day was not taken in.", "Along the way, we see Ward make love to Jenny (Dalana Bissonnette), randomly inter-cut with scenes of his so-called friends talking about Gary & Jenny behind their backs, while indulging in straight, lesbian, anal and/or group sex. What the film is about is sex, not \"gossip\".", "How this all ends is for the interested viewer to discover, but it is a truly lame, hurried resolution to the forced hullabaloo (no spoiler from me). Suffice it to say that the windbag of a narrator waxing poetic, indulging in free association, constantly complaining, and commenting on the action (he criticizes lesbianism in the most flagrant example here of attempted pandering to the target audience of lonely males) are all cues to hit the Mute button early on.", "Film favors the extreme closeups approach of the gynecological school of porn -I guess that was analogous in terms of pernicious '70s trends in directing to what MTV has wrought in mainstream directing since the '80s. Music track insists on playing Serge Gainsbourg over & over & over -extremely boring.", "The only point of interest for me was an unusual actress, Tina Smith. She wears glasses, has huge breasts and takes it in the rear, all of which (except for the glasses) elicit gee-whiz commentary from the narrator.

Final scene is Billy & Buck going to work as usual, but (undoubtedly due to swapping & absentmindedness) carrying each other's briefcases by accident and even each about to get into the wrong car before politely correcting themselves.

Is turned on by men having sex with each other She's even more turned on when she gets to join them, as shown in flashback with Tony Belmonte and Sean Hunter. Decent enough scene.", "Collins shows a straight couple (Jon Dough and LeAnna Foxxx) the house (or the bedroom set, anyway), and after they leave, she fantasizes about them - she's not in the fantasy, she just pictures them rutting on the couch as we sometimes cut back to her touching herself (whether or not she was wearing panties while showing off the house is up to our imagination I guess). This scene, like many in porn by this point, feels endless, with Foxxx overcompensating and Dough, who must have done these five million times, looking very bored.", "Courtney, one of the callers at the start of the film, arrives for a tour with girlfriend Jade East, leading to a fantasy between the galpals that ends with Courtney wearing a strap-on. This isn't a bad scene either.", "Hart converts a still wary Collins by showing her a gay porn video featuring Chris Stone and Scott Hardman. This scene also feels never-ending. You'd think to spice things up they might have had Hart and Collins playing with themselves, or each other, but clearly the landlady's new sexual curiosity still does not involve sapphic sex.", "The final scene has her meeting her two new potential clients, a gay couple (Matt Windsor and Mark Andrews), and hitting them up for sex. A clever idea would have been them turning the tables on her and saying they aren't sure, asking her what she'll do in exchange. Instead, they immediately start yanking her clothes off. The resulting encounter has some heat to it, but more creative use of the concept could have taken this over the edge.", "The other memorable moment in the movie is the cast list, which, aside from the last two guys and Collins, intros them with closeups of their \"o\" faces.

Especially Bourvil and Pierre Brasseur (with a hoarse voice, while his voice was so splendid in Enfants du Paradis) are great. In many modern films this sense of aesthetics is gone.

It is somewhat hard to believe that smart and seemingly savvy Jim Blake (JMB) could be deceived for so long about the dangerously mean character of the man whose life he saved out in the desert's local badlands, especially since everyone else he knew tries to warn him, even his female love interest (the two men have more than one interaction of what seems to be affectionate horsing around that may seem a little surprising when contrasting yesterday's sensibilities with today's). This film is consistently entertaining. However, it becomes increasingly grim as the characters' relationships become ever more complex and sometimes strained (it is always interesting to view a film that shows a basically happy and breezy hero caught up in distressing turmoil).\nThe acting is good in general, with the exception of leading lady Lucille Browne, who gives a consistently weak read. John Merton has a juicy role as the supporting very bad badman and does a fine job with it; he seems to pop up everywhere all the time and has almost as much screen time as JMB. The rest of the cast are familiar stablemates and it is fun just to look at all those fabulous faces. Plus the good ol' dependably photogenic Vasquez Rocks make yet another Oscar-worthy appearance.\n\"The Crooked Trail\" is a story-propelled movie for sure, but the direction and the cinematography could have been a little more polished. And one more thing... the fight scenes are strong and not for the faint of heart. But when Johnny Mack Brown wasn't fighting he had such a warm and reassuring presence that he must have made a lot of girls in the audience swoon! Enjoy the movie!"]},

Ray,a former big name star, plays a corrupt cop. He appeared in scores of cheap features throughout the 70s but at least here, he has a half decent character and actually gets to emote a little.

Now I am NOT saying films prior to this were bad...but the newer films are, in general, more appealing to western audiences. I mention this because although \"Ishq\" is a good film, it has a few problems you'd expect in a film made during this era...particularly very broad acting (at times, overacting) and poor music quality.

But there is no subtlety and the characters are pretty annoying at times....even Aamir Khan, who is my favorite Indian actor.

It was filmed in Australia, mostly in a studio, with backgrounds filmed, on obviously different film stock, in England.", "The film is also notable as the debut of Shirley Ann Richards, who would become a big star in Australia and later, as Ann Richards, play some good roles in Hollywood.  It also features a brilliant performance by Harvey Adams as a confused English butler who is charmed by the earthiness of his new master."]},

(1966) is the last feature film directed by Aarne Tarkas (1923-1976).It represents a more modern military farce.Esko Salminen gives a terrific and most hilarious performance as Heikki Lilja.And so is Kauko Helovirta as Pertti Paaso.Helge \"Heguli\" Herala is brilliant as \"Kahle-Kustaa\".Liana Kaarina does a great job as Merja Metsä.Uljas Kandolin is amazing as Colonel Taipale.Leo Jokela is very funny as Police chief Mäkinen.Leni Katajakoski does a great performance as Kaisa the cleaner.Jarno Hiilloskorpi and Ismo Kallio are hilarious as those two officers.Great job by Elsa Turakainen, who plays Lilja's mother.Pia Hattara does a terrific performance as Ikäneito.Rose-Marie Precht portrays Annikki.Leo Riuttu does his last feature film performance as Affu.Martti Palo plays the colonel's driver.Keijo Komppa is Kalle.Aarre Karén plays Lieutenat.Director Tarkas himself plays Driving man.There are many great moments in this movie.It's hilarious when Lilja gets into the hotel and the woman finds this man in the same bath with her.Or when he's hiding in the same room with the just married couple.Also when Paaso is at Lilja's apartment and those two officers arrive.He can't tell them the truth so he gets arrested, this man known as \"Tiirikka-Pete\".Most funny is the sequence when Lilja portrays a sheik and Paaso speaks to him in a language that sounds Arabic.But it's gibberish, of course.Many laughs come from the situation when those two men have to prove which one is the artist Paaso- by drawing a girl at the well.The real Paaso's style represents some modern art, which the policemen and the colonel can't understand, but it looks to them more like something a child has drawn.But the simple work by the crook, where you can actually see a girl on a well with a bucket, works for them.They make an auction for the work, and Colonel Taipale gets this masterpiece for 300 marks.Watch this movie and laugh."]},

Inoue was passionately concerned with bridging the gap between Japan and foreign countries, and this passion is forcefully expressed throughout the movie with respect to relations between Japan and Russia. Or rather, considering the story was set in the 1790s during the reign of Catherine The Great, the potential for relations. This period was perhaps the darkest days of Japans period of self-imposed isolation, and the feeling of opportunities lost looms large here.", "This being a tale of sailors bearing hardships through a long journey inevitably draws comparison with Ulysses, as does the journey across Siberia to Doctor Zhivago, and the film comes up quite respectably in comparison.", "In summary, this is an film epic in scale which also manages to show the humanity of the main characters as well, and equally well.

She is a demanding primadonna and loves praise. Two officers are assigned to her, one who loves her work, one who never goes to films. She is threatened by the cult which the murderer is part of, so you wonder whether she is actually going to go through with it. There is action, drama but there is a terrific comic touch to it. This is not surprising, as director Juzo Itami showed often enough in films like \"Minbo\", \"The Funeral\" and \"A Taxing Woman\" that he was gifted in his approach to telling a story. Equally gifted actress Nobuko Miyamoto, who was Mr. Itami's wife, is just about perfect as the actress. She exhibits the right amount of histrionics, fear and comic intensity in her role. She is also a very attractive lady and is obviously relishing this portrayal. Sadly, this was their last film collaboration, as Mr. Itami committed suicide, but he left behind an impressive body of work, as Ms. Miyamoto still does. I highly recommend this film."]},

I'm sure Ms. Red-Horse has heard the criticism loud and clear and I hope she has taken it to heart, and the movie itself had just enough good to it that I expect something much better next time.", "I personally want my children to love, respect, honor, and revere American Indians.

William Gibson is heavy on description and atmosphere, a master at it.  \"Neuromancer\", his best book, is enthralling even if you don't know what is happening.  The screenplay for the movie should have been padded out more in the beginning maybe showing some history of X and some of the babe's motivations clearer.  The story was somewhat obscure.  If you didn't listen carefully you missed the plot.  The movie was flawed but atmospheric and moody enough to be of interest.

One of the foremost figures in the genre was songwriter Reino Helismaa who also wrote a great number of movie scripts. Helismaa's collaborations with the popular comedian Esko \"Eemeli\" Toivonen include many silly but entertaining flicks like Kaks' tavallista Lahtista (1960) and Voi veljet, mikä päivä! (1961) as well as three movies with Eemeli mentioned in the title. Oho, sanoi Eemeli is the first one out of them and turns out to be a very positive surprise.", "The story begins when Eemeli's elderly parents observe that their potato crops are failing to meet their expectations. Subsequently they send their grown bachelor son out in the world to earn some money and he soon joins a group of musical lumberjacks in the village of Römpsänperä which unfortunately suffers from a chronic lack of timber. At the same time a self-confident razor salesman Tommi (Tommi Rinne) arrives in the village in order to win a bet regarding his unbelievable selling skills. In addition, romantic feelings start developing between the lumberjacks' new lady cook Marjatta (Leni Katajakoski) and one of the handsome men of the crew.", "Eemeli has been called \"the Buster Keaton of Finland\" and the connection between the two dead-pan comedians is not hard to see, even though Eemeli is anything but silent. His stone-faced one-liners and puns evoke memories of the hilarious monologues of Pvt. Honkajoki in the war classic The Unknown Soldier (1955) but also of Groucho Marx's famous wordplays. Lines like \"Harvoin mekin ansaitsemme\" and \"Sic transit Gloria Swanson\" would be amusing in their own right, but besides Eemeli's charisma, the charm of the movie lies in the plentiful, catchy and highly amusing musical numbers by Eemeli and various other characters, such as the beautiful Leni Katajakoski and the \"Mini-Elvis\" child star Vesa Enne who gets to perform several funny rocking tunes while barely outsizing his guitar.", "Vesa Enne as the young lumber boss-in-training is certainly among the funniest characters, but his Karelian on-screen father Einari (Einari Ketola) stands out as well. The legendary Siiri Angerkoski just cannot be anything but good as Marjatta's sturdy aunt Isabella, but I especially loved the handsome Tommi Rinne in the role of the fussy and suave electronic razor salesman whose business keeps running into troubles due to the lack of electricity in the lumberjacks' cabin. Eemeli himself may not have the most melodic singing voice out there, but his \"mouth-trumpet\" and verbal gags easily earn him a justified position as the title character of the film.", "Even though it is understandable that overly serious film academics may not find anything to appreciate in the rillumarei humour, fans of featherweight musical comedies have absolutely no reason to miss Oho, sanoi Eemeli. Sure, the plot is secondary to the jokes and there are no subtle societal messages hidden in the story, but at the same time the film achieves its own goals with flying colours. The music is excellent and the 90 minutes fly by, so I think the movie can safely be called a Finnish 1960s comedy classic."]},

All these people have stories to impart upon Tereza, and as the encounters become more and more surreal it becomes apparent that, as we see the film from a child's perspective, here a child's fantasy and imagination are melded with reality.", "On the surface Orbis Pictus presents itself as a quirky and serene film about a young girl journeying in ignorance of the world around her. Yet there's an underlying sense of menace here, as through the various encounters Tereza's innocence is tested against a darker side of reality that, while only hinted at, is a disturbing presence all the same and sets up perfectly for the film's last revelations as we learn the contents of the letter and as Tereza finally comes face to face with her mother.

Near the beginning of the film, Tristan, the painter, asks how he can portray emptiness. Uher answers his question by showing that the entity of emptiness can only be depicted through the acts of filling and emptying. We see a great vault of a room suddenly empty of people as bomb sirens sound and then refill as police enter to remove Tristan. We see a ladder descend to fill the space of a cellar. But most important of all, Uher spins a story of a mysterious girl, Anabella, filling the empty minds of the city's male inhabitants.", "I think you have to consider the possibility that Anabella may just be the figment of the imagination, albeit a sort of collective imagination. The psychoanalyst calls her his libido, and for the other characters too, she represents a great internalized and creative force. Her relationship with Raven, the sculptor, is perhaps the most revealing. Raven creates plaster masks from the faces of dead women. He wants to create a mask of Anabella, but she has to be dead first. She may not literally die, but when her mask is made, it seems to signal the death of the imaginative essence that she represents. Once the imagination is manifested and shared, it loses its purity, its virginity. In sharing his imagination, the artist has sullied it in pandering to the desires of an audience. In an earlier scene, we see Anabella and the poet in his room. They imagine his mother approving her as his bride. It is fanciful and pure. Later, we see him caressing the mask. The scene is dirty and obscene. His mother actually is there, and she doesn't approve. Anabella's no longer a virgin. He calls her a slut and destroys the mask. As a lion, Raven speaks as to how he doesn't want to devour Anabella, but the opposite. Yet in projecting her he allows others to do the devouring.", "And if the imagination reveals emptiness, what does it say about the time and place? The film could be read as one of many works that deal with the struggle against censorship and the desire to express something purely without compromising its value to the artist. Raven is commissioned to create a sculptor of a politician. He wishes to honor the land and people that he loves. But his commissioners don't envision the sculpture as he does. They only see art as a means of furthering their own power. Beware of the holy whore."]},

During her day in the big city, little Liisa diligently tries to get her brooms sold and encounters various people from criminals to cops, some of whom are nice, some not as much.", "I remember seeing this movie as a kid and still thought fondly of it when seeing it again now after many years. Considering the premise and the era it was made in, the movie is actually way less cheesy than it could have been. Of course, the adorable little Liisa (played by the young Riitta Hämäläinen who is credited as \"the fairytale girl of Savo\" in the opening credits) is thoroughly innocent and naive especially from a cynical modern point of view, but the film doesn't really portray the city as a completely rotten place either like many old cautionary tales do. All references to adult themes like pedophilia and prostitution remain somewhat veiled and are suitable for young viewers too.", "The evil characters like the slimy \"friend of children\" Julius (Oiva Sala) or a busy lady who cheats Liisa in her business are contrasted against the goodie types like Petteri, a hobo with a heart of gold (Leo Lähteenmäki) and the righteous policeman Rinne (Kauko Kokkonen). Also seen are morally torn figures like an anxious prostitute (Nelly Anita Lovén) and Julius' gutsy wife Emma (Siiri Angerkoski). A rich family with a snobby mother and a poor family with friendly parents could be mentioned too.", "As a fan of musicals I was delighted by Harry Bergström's score and the songs, especially Petteri's recurring tune, the joyous ball-playing song of the rich family's kids and the amusing \"Putipux\" vacuum cleaner ditty. I admit having said this about many old movies, but I must mention that the busy Helsinki streets make a very nice backdrop for the events and are fun to see more than 50 years after they were filmed. Riitta Hämäläinen handles the lead role alright considering the light tone of the story and the fact that they have obviously put a lot of trust in her cuteness to win audiences over. Leo Lähteenmäki is also very lovable as the friendly hobo Petteri.", "It has been said that in a way the people Liisa encounters on her trip symbolize the ten commandments of the bible, but such an interpretation is not really something that comes to mind immediately when watching the movie. Maybe I'm getting soft, but to me Pieni luutatyttö remains a sympathetic little movie with an adorably positive message; in many ways old-fashioned and silly, I still like it for its entertainment value and characters."]},

We begin with some Bacchanalian banquet orgy with sex, food and some of the wildest body painting ever, and then continue. The only slight respite is when the young, almost naked, couple go walking/dancing through the woods but even there amidst the most wonderfully shot autumnal scenes they become turned on by the sight of naked people bound to trees and being whipped and we get a ravishing riverside sequence. Another stand out scene involves a naked lady almost delirious as she pleasures herself with a bucket load of squid and fish, some still alive.

It's not a bad idea... problem is, the script isn't up to par.  In fact, it's pretty bad.  Secondly, Mark Walberg is way out of his league trying to carry the lead in this film.  I remember reading all the publicity for the film and laughed when Burton and Zanuck tried to compare Walberg to Steve McQueen.  Look, I like Walberg, I think he's a decent enough actor, but he's not at the point where he has the emotional gravitas to carry the lead in a film. The story has no emotional pathos.  It's just a simple A to B to C, nonstop chase film.  And what was the point of trying to keep the ending secret?  It doesn't even make sense.

The honour of answering this question is left to the viewer who are presented images of actual wartime people. The level of historicity is high although the author of the script has taken some concise liberties to make the story more effective and the characters look more \"like themselves\"; for example the historical Colonel Armas Kemppi is replaced with fictive Colonel Markkovilla. The spotlight however concentrates on Major General Axel Fredrik Airo who is played by Jussi Jurkka and, mostly because of Jurkka's fine performance, Airo becomes the main character.", "The movie does not extol specifically anybody. Marshall Mannerheim (Joel Rinne) is the army commander with almost mythological level of authority but he has his own small flaws too and sometimes he is quite humoristic character too. The Marshall will reprimand his Generals, dispute with them, admit his mistakes and he is also seen descending to the level of ordinary soldier without losing a bit of his status. Rinne's performance still remains as the most lively one among other pieces that feature Mannerheim.", "Although \"Päämaja\" is a war movie pretty much of it is sheer drama. Even so it still captures the atmosphere of the time when Finland was threatened by Soviet steel steamroller. The picture of ordinary soldier's realm gives a very different impression than that of the headquarters' activity: they are like two different wars but because the picture of shabby foot soldier appears in the same movie with a cosmopolitan Marshall it gives \"Päämaja\" a considerable and genuine deepness."]},

One of the most famous examples of the French New Wave influence in Finnish cinema is Mikko Niskanen's 1966 film Skin, Skin a.k.a. Käpy selän alla, which originally overshadowed Rakkaus alkaa aamuyöstä, Jarno Hiilloskorpi's take on the same subject matter that was even released the same year. A pity, because Hiilloskorpi's film is not bad at all.", "At the beginning a young man named Erkki (Martti Järvinen) is released from his obligatory military service and returns home to his parents. His gruff father Juuso (Kalervo Nissilä) has already arranged him a job for the summer, but Erkki chooses to have some vacation for himself and travels to the family's summer place to figure out what he would really like to do in life. His frustration with his journalist girlfriend Anne (Liisamaija Laaksonen) leads him to meet many other girls, most importantly a bank clerk named Eila (Elli Castrén), but it is clear that eventually he will have to sort his situation out properly.", "The liberated techniques and styles of the new wave of filmmaking are utilized pleasantly in Rakkaus: some camera movements and angles and especially the music often directly mirror the feelings of the characters. The score by Ilkka Kuusisto really deserves praise all around as does Eila's beautiful song, but the nature scenery and photography are enjoyable as well. Besides the setting in the countryside, Rakkaus is also reminiscent of Niskanen's Käpy with regard to nudity that is more open and sexual than in typical older films, even though the actual sex scenes look very tame from a modern perspective.", "More than a plot-driven story, Rakkaus relies on an atmosphere of restlessness and Erkki's youthful mood shifts. Amidst alternating scenes of funny comedy and serious love story, he changes from responsible to outgoing and back, always coming across as natural and realistic enough. His female objects of attraction are all very pretty and the actresses handle their roles well, particularly Laaksonen as the aggressive Anne and Castrén as the quieter Eila, even though some of the lines given to the latter sometimes sound oddly formal and literal. I also enjoyed Kari Franck's performance as Erkki's loud joker friend Matti who provides a lot of the humour in the film. Leo Jokela's role as Erkki's philosophical gardener uncle Jalmari belongs among the more pensive aspects of the tale, but Jokela's calm charisma supports the plot line easily.", "All in all, I think Erkki's quest for finding his purpose in life is worth seeing and does not lose to the similar themes examined in Niskanen's Käpy selän alla. It is always nice to see this type of films from Finland; I wish Hiilloskorpi would have directed more films than just the two he is credited for now. The point is, I really enjoyed Rakkaus alkaa aamuyöstä and would recommend it to those who liked Käpy or, say, Eino Ruutsalo's Windy Day (1962)."]},

Meaty stuff indeed!!!! While many seem overly hung up on the modest budget and formulaic text, I relished the wonderfully unexpected whimsicality therein, with Geoffrey Reeve's 'Shadow Run' frequently playing out like a glossier, feature-length episode of 'Dempsey and Makepeace', incongruently intertwined with a bizarrely retrograde Billy Bunter-esque subplot!!!!?? Another major plus being the scintillatingly perky presence of Rae Baker, who makes for some salaciously snackable screen candy!

The play has been produced frequently both in England and within the United States, with a broad range of critical opinion a result. This picture is similar to a performance given upon the boards, shot using videotape, and having but one single room set, while showcasing a small cast of six players. Not smoothly constructed, it is nonetheless generally engrossing, and at times amusing, despite its lack of a limit placed upon effects from the intervention of chance. Charles Norbury (Michael Moriarty) is a successful author of stories for small children, but the lively books that he has penned for tots are not reflective upon his own personality, one that is unpleasantly sardonic. His wife, Anne (Joanna Miles), having had her fill of his acrimony, has taken a lover, a United States Naval Commander, Peter Marriott, played by David Ackroyd. Norbury is aware of his wife's affair, but refuses to grant her a divorce. Marriott, thwarted by the stubbornness of Anne's husband, induces her to assist him in murdering Charles, her revulsion at the commission of such a desperate act weakened by her overwhelming affection for Peter who has configured a complex plot to kill Norbury. However, the writer's personal secretary Ilene (Pippa Scott) becomes an unanticipatedly critical factor in the felonious arrangement, especially significant for a film having such obvious economy of means. Although there is only a sparse amount of dialogue that may be considered as freshly observed, the film is well photographed. An overage of flaws in logic and continuity eventually overwhelms what remains essentially a rather ordinary murder mystery. Any methods employed to create a mood of suspense are handy, since author Fairchild simply echoes his lines from the staged play that was first performed in 1959. A viewer may find only patchy interest in the film, at best, but there are spirited highlights, despite the production's being turned halfway through into quite a predictable affair that goes on for longer than it should. As the victim of the captioned crime, Moriarty seems to be enjoying himself, and Miles adds satisfactory depth to her too often mildewed lines."]},

First, there is the story of how Capt. Bulman (stiff upper lipped cinematic stalwart Richard Todd) is shipwrecked in North Africa, loses his memory, regains it and unravels the mystery of why his ship went down. Second, is the story of how his wife Emma, together with loyal maid Bessie and son Dominic, set up a new life in Yorkshire with the help of shouty drunken gambler William Woodcock. Gradually, the two stories knit together to make a satisfying whole. The scripts are uniformly excellent, by a team including Penelope Lively.", "Key to any drama featuring children is the ability of the child actors. The children in this are pretty variable, but Murray Dale as the eponymous Nick is absolutely superb, with a charming smile that he turns on particularly for his adored mother. What a loss to the profession he was - he played the same character in the sequel, but otherwise his CV is bare. He's hard to trace with Google, but one hopes he's had a nice life.", "The early Richard Todd sequences don't add very much. He totters about in the sun, falling over and having terrible things happen to him. Shot on location in Tunisia, unfortunately the team had to get value for money in terms of the footage shown, so this is a bit overdone (and probably could have been shot at Bridlington on a nice day to save money). He has some bad luck and some good luck; at one stage he is kidnapped by Maxine Audley who has taken a shine to him, and bizarrely he wishes to escape (some of us would give our eye teeth for such a fate worse than death). But once he gets his memory back and is on his way to England, this sequence picks up pace and becomes dominant. Dominic himself fades away, and is barely present in the last couple of episodes.", "The story of Emma, her bereavement and grief, and her pluck, together with the gradual growth of her friendship - could it be love? - for rough diamond William, is the main interest early on. There is a slight soap operaish feel to some of the episodes, but different aspects of the late Georgian era are highlighted, from early factories to injustice to the rigid society to early law enforcement and punishment. Nick appears to attract every difficult fellow in Yorkshire - if there is an escaped felon, a wounded highwayman, or any other morally ambiguous character in need of help, he will, as sure as anything, bump into Nick.", "The cast is a uniformly excellent bunch of highly recognisable British character actors for trivia fans. Apart from those mentioned, we have Hildegard Neil and Brian Blessed as Emma and William, Ruth Kettlewell as Bessie, and Julian Glover as a hissable villain making up the principals. Mary Morris is the grandma from hell, Ivor Dean a crooked shipowner, and Ken Jones an eccentric Bow Street Runner (the forerunners of Scotland Yard). Others on the scene include Reginald Marsh, Morris Perry, Leslie Schofield, Peter Cellier, Basil Henson, Gary Raymond, Brian Wilde, Frances Cuka, and David Troughton.", "The series really gives a strong sense of the times. Emma and Bessie are powerful characters, and we see them working in the context of the society of the time, with no social safety net, dependent on the help of others but never helpless. I'd be tempted to call it a highly educational series, if that didn't imply a sense of earnestness that would be misleading.", "The long arm of coincidence does stretch at times, if we were being picky.

Desmond's oldest son, Michael, was sort of a mirror image of his father, a stuffed shirt banker who always had to do things by the book.  Michael's younger sister and brother, were typical teens, prone to the ups and downs of growing up.

This movie incorporated all the antics and scenery shots that the original had including the cemetery, the supposable abandoned house, the basement and the front lawn. What I especially love about this movie is the comical use of bread and all the common household enemies bread has a grudge against. C'mon, we know that toasters, toaster ovens and zip-locks have done bread in a dozen times and now we must call for their help in order to defeat the reanimated bread. Aside from the cheap acting and voice-overs, this short horror film is my personal favorite parody of Night of the Living Dead, even better than Night of the Living Dead of 1990.", "I think what makes this movie worth watching is how the writers and directors utilized all the dialogue from the original movie and revolved it around bread, including how the bread became reanimated and to avoid leftovers because they are especially dangerous. Another great reason why I love this movie is that, there is no exception as to what bread is evil, bagels are evil and even communions are evil, which is demonstrated by a hilarious scene involving a newscaster and a rather monotone priest. I think that the actors are especially humorous performing the deed of being viscously attacked by slices of bread (i.e. the car scene). I think the end is very worth sticking around.", "Even though this is a short and that \"Night of the Day of the Dawn of the Son of the Bride of the Return of the Revenge of the Terror of the Attack of the Evil, Mutant, Alien, Flesh Eating, Hellbound, Zombified Living Dead Part 2: In Shocking 2-D\" is debatably another great parody, it's still recommend as a great horror parody done by, what seems to be college filmmakers.

After the cancellation of the programme in 1981, the remainder of the decade witnessed a number of attempts to recreate its magic, notably LWT's own \"Dempsey and Makepeace\" and Television South's (TVS) \"CATS Eyes\" ", "In 1988 ITV's new Midlands-based broadcaster Central Television launched \"Saracen\" and arguably came artistically closest to reviving \"The Professionals\". However the series remains largely forgotten, a problem exacerbated by a curious lack of repeat screenings (at least in the UK). Does it deserve its obscurity? ", "The series was created by Chris Kelly, best known to viewers as the presenter of Granada Television's 1970s film review series \"Clapperboard\". He teamed up with Ted Childs, producer on the classic 1970s cop show \"The Sweeney\". Opening with a 90-minute pilot feature entitled 'The Zero Option', the action concentrated on SAS Major David Barber (played by Stephen Hattersley) who resigns his commission after being forced to undertake a badly-planned hostage rescue. Headhunted by private security company Saracen Systems he is partnered with Australian ex-Army sergeant Jack Carne (John Walton). Barber's first mission for his new employer is to recover diamonds which were stolen during a fake aircraft siege. Assisted by fellow Saracen employees, intelligence officer Alice Kavanagh (Joanna Phillips-Lane), technical expert Eric Nugent (David Moss) and company founder Colonel Patrick Ansell (Eric Flynn), the combination of tension, action and humour promised much ", "It isn't clear what Central Television's intention was when the pilot was followed up by a regular series of 50-minute episodes. The entire main cast had been ditched - with one exception all the lead characters remained but now played by different actors. In stepped Chistian Burgess as Barber, Ingrid Lacey as Alice, John Bennett as Nugent and Michael Byrne as Ansell. The character of Carne was replaced completely by that of Tom Duffy, an American ex-Delta Force commando, played by the little-known Patrick James Clarke. Also gone was Barber's wife, who had died off-screen, although no explanation was ever given. One assumes this was a move to allow Barber to become romantically involved with various guest characters aka \"dead girlfriend of the week\". Another notable change was the budget: there would be no money for the large-scale action set pieces seen in 'The Zero Option'. (In one episode Alice's car was crashed into from front and rear by the villains, yet none of the cars appeared to suffer any damage!) ", "Involving some of British television's top genre writers and directors, the series was well-scripted with likable characters and solid acting but lacked any real \"Unique Selling Point\" and generally came across as an utterly average offering. The absence of high-octane thrills and rousing musical themes (Barrington Pheloung providing the utterly forgettable score) didn't help. Some episodes involved genuine overseas locations but this did nothing to heighten the series' appeal.", "On the plus side Patrick James Clarke made the most of his role and is essentially the programme's sole source of humour. (It's somewhat of a mystery as to why Clarke's acting career came to an end shortly afterwards).", "Most episodes revolved around the bodyguard protection of a Saracen client or the rescue of a kidnapping victim. Indeed part of the problem for the show – a flaw in the programme's very concept – was that the range of situations that Saracen would tackle was very narrow, leaving writers to struggle to come up with new twists and spins in their plots. Too often Saracen's remit was exhausted and Ansell would have to order his team to hand over to the police. The better episodes were usually those which had a personal impact on our heroes ", "In 'Starcross' Barber gets unwittingly involved in a family with IRA connections who recognise him as the man who shot dead one of their own during an SAS raid in the 1970s.", "In 'Next Year in Jerusalem' an ageing Nazi hunter, Frankel, finds a lead to the man who executed his wife and daughter during WW2. In a counter move, Frankel himself becomes the target and seeks protection from Saracen. However Barber and Duffy find the apparently frail old man is surprisingly sprightly, resourceful and cunning.", "In 'Reaper' a psychotic mercenary kidnaps Barber's young son, offering to release him in exchange for access to a group of Arabs whom the hit-man has been hired to kill.", "On the whole \"Saracen\" failed to live up to its pilot. Given the burgeoning obsession with ratings at the time – and the looming up of broadcasting license renewals - it's no too difficult to understand why Central did not commission further series. Yet had they poured more money into it in the first place, it may have had more success amongst viewers. Either way it's a shame because a second season would almost certainly have offered improvements.", "Other than rare repeats on cable and satellite channels, \"Saracen\" slipped from people's memories. Fortunately the pilot and all thirteen regular episodes are now available on DVD. For fans of the genre it's worth picking up - as an interesting obscurity if nothing else although it's in danger of simply serving as a reminder of how superior \"The Professionals\" was!"]},

Shabtai wants a son. He goes through every conceivable (!) consultation and ritual, much of it ridiculous superstition, to guarantee that his next child by wife Zaharira Harifai will be a boy.  He needs a male heir and feels that without one he will be less of a man. A child is born, another daughter of course. Disappointed and embittered he cruelly casts off his wife, and only when he is forced to care for his unwanted infant daughter and when his best friend gets his oldest daughter pregnant, does he begin to take a sharper look at his own stupidities. The movie is ingratiating, earthy, funny.

He has a couple of lines of dialog post-synched at the downbeat finale. Effect more closely resembles an hour-long (ugh!) porno loop, rather than an actual feature film.", "Four attractive women are cast as strippers, 3 of them top heavy. One is a \"reluctant\" bar girl recruited in a pinch into stripping, and she unconvincingly feigns awkwardness before becoming Joe's star attraction with a belly dancing routine.

No frontal nudity in this '68 opus, although one bathtub scene has perhaps a single frame revealing bush that was beyond the capabilities of my DVD player, which can only slow things down to 1/8's normal speed.", "In common with Crilly's other works, there is a bondage theme running through here, though unlikely to impress the current deviant audience that buys so-called Adventure DVD's of women tied up and gagged for fun & profit. (NOTE to IMDb: please reclassify the thousands of 21st Century videos of that ilk as porn rather than putting them into the \"Adventure\" genre due to lack of \"hardcore penetration\"!!) I liked the self-consciously noir ending for its convincing cynicism and living up to the film's title. But apart from a couple of minutes or so of ogling from a vantage point below Pat and the blonde dancing topless this one is a long slog for the gentle soft porn viewer. The repeated over & over \"after hours\" jazz-style score is soporific and combined with absence of dialog to ensure a lot of snoring during this baby's theatrical run."]},

Roman soldiers in the Gallic War mainly wore simple bronze helmets and chain-mail armor.", "This movie is dedicated to ", "Featured in ", " (1999)", "When I was a little kid, my Dad picked up a copy of The Twelve Tasks of Asterix at the local video store.  Oh, happy day!  I've been completely enamored with Asterix and his adventures ever since.", "The wily little Gaul first appeared in 1959, in a French children's magazine, and gradually his creators  Rene Goscinny and Albert Uderzo built him up into a national phenomenon.  Asterix has his own cartoons, his own theme park, and now his own big-budget movies (a pair of the most expensive French films ever made, in fact).  Wildly popular throughout Europe and even parts of Asia, Asterix remains obscure in the United States, which is why this film has seen no official distribution here.  Thankfully, Miramax recently purchased the rights to both this movie and its sequel, Asterix: Mission Cleopatra, so they should both be seen in the U.S. eventually.", "The concept behind the character is simple.  Asterix is a small, cunning warrior who, in conjunction with his strong, dumb friend Obelix, travels the Roman Empire thwarting the plans of Caesar and his imperialist minions. Aiding Asterix in his quest is the druid Getafix, who brews a magical potion that endows its drinker with super-strength.", "After seeing disastrous big-screen revivals of Godzilla, The Avengers, and Star Wars, I was reluctant to see this poorly-reviewed film.  Sure, it did great box office, earning more than double its $45 million price tag, but so what?  Popularity isn't always an indicator of quality.", "But hey, I liked it!", "The film's design is just gorgeous, with the outrageous settings and costumes from the comic strips recreated in loving detail.  The soundtrack is lovely, creating a real \"period\" feel.  The opening segments are a big slow  the fish fight and the boulder-dropping sequence are pretty silly. But soon after that, the story takes off like a bullet.", "The film has an episodic structure, with multiple subplots running at once. This has opened the film up to criticism, but I rather liked seeing a \"greatest hits of Asterix\" movie.  It's all here  giant battles in the arena, Obelix falling in love with Panacea, Asterix clashing with a charlatan soothsayer, Getafix winning the golden sickle at the annual druid's conference.  It's a cut-and-paste combination of several Asterix comics, but it works.", "Much of the film's success is owed to the cast.  Depardieu was born to play Obelix, and he dives into the role without pretense, playing the oaf with comic flair.  Clavier's Asterix has been panned by some but I thought he was witty, and he bears an almost eerie resemblance to the comic book character in some shots.  Benigni is the ideal Asterix villain, hamming it up like a lunatic, and Laetitia Casta makes a gorgeous Panacea.", "The special effects are delightful.  Romans get punched over hill and dale, Asterix pulls hilarious faces when he drinks his potion, and clever visual trickery makes dozens of Roman extras look like hundreds.  The sets are spacious and impressive, and the film has wonderfully rich colors (particularly reds, which appear everywhere  Asterix's pants, the Roman uniforms and tents, the banners in the arena)", "Of course it's just silly rubbish, but it's perfect entertainment for kids and kids-at-heart.  No one is killed and there's nothing mean-spirited about it.  Big-budget though it is, the film has a European wit and silliness that is lacking in American action films.  French critics were afraid that the film would be imitation Hollywood rubbish, infesting the otherwise \"pure\" French cinema, but I think those fears are unfounded.  There's nothing commercial about Asterix, thank goodness.", "Citizen Kane it ain't, but I was thoroughly entertained.  Ignore the film's mostly bad reviews and give it a try (if you can get a copy, that is!).  I think you'll be pleasantly surprised."]},

", "Without giving plot details away, suffice it to say that the film begins with an interesting premise as it explores the betrothal rituals of this particular time and place that reduced women to objects essentially bartered away to the highest bidder. The heroine of the story, played by the absolutely exquisite Ines Sastre, rebels on her arranged-marriage wedding day, and the plot continues from there. ", "Diego Abatantuono, no slouch himself in the looks department, plays a long absent stranger who, having made his fortune in America, returns to the town and ends up participating in the ceremony.

W. Griffith's Birth of a Nation) and shocking for what it is (a war-propaganda film intended, amongst other things, to recruit African Americans to serve in the army of a nation that still refused to grant them the most basic civil rights).", "It is shocking because the original notion for such a film, first floated by Booker T. Washington's NAACP, had indeed been to respond to Griffith's racist epic The original idea was to make a modest film entitled Lincoln's Dream, produced entirely by African Americans, that would give the lie to Griffith's nonsense and to the rhetoric of the newly-revived Ku Klux Klan. The NAACP approached Universal but, meeting with no response, put the idea in the hands of Emmett J. Scott, who had been Washington's right-hand man at the Tuskegee Institute.", "Reel back a few years to 1910, the year when Jack Johnson, the first African American heavyweight champion of the world decisively defeated \"the great white hope\" Jim Jeffries. And to 1913, the year when Caribbean American comic Bert Williams made a film for Biograph with an all-black cast. The film entitled Lime Kiln Field Day or Lime Kiln Club Field Day was feature-length (even unfinished the surviving film is an hour long)and, if completed and released, would have meant that a film with an all-black film was amongst the first feature-length films made in the US (and evidently earlier than the Griffith epic). ", "See my note on that film for how the boxer Jeffries found himself arrested on trumped-up sex-charges (in 1912) and on how Lime Kiln Field day, although virtually complete, was abandoned for reasons that remain mysterious but can all too easily be guessed at.", "The way was clear for the Griffith's Birth of a Nation which appeared in 1915. Despite its huge popularity and despite the massive upsurge in racist feeling that followed it, nothing could entirely turn the clock back in the way those nostalgic for the good old days of slavery might have hoped. Sam Lucas, an actor who had worked with Williams on Lime Kiln Field Day and who had already played the part of Uncle Tom on stage (the first African American to do so) was given the part in Universal's film-version of the Beecher Stowe novel that appeared in 1914. To fulfil what was presuably a broken contract with Williams, Biograph allowed him to produce, direct and star in three short films with largely all-black casts in 1916 (Natural Born Gambler, Fish, which survive, and Darktown Jubilee, now lost). All were based on established vaudeville routines but rely heavily on racial caricature and are not nearly as good as the 1913 Lime Kiln Field Day.", "Jack Johnson remained heavyweight champion of the world and in 1913 defended his title in the first ever all-black contest against Battling Jim Johnson, a contest which was not filmed although films continued to be made of attempts to defeat him by a succession of further white hopes until in 1919 he was finally knocked out by \"cowboy\" giant Jess Willard.", "In 1916, the brothers Noble and George Johnson founded the Lincoln Motion Picture Company, which produced six feature-length films between 1916 and 1923, none of which sadly appear to survive.", "To return to 1918 and Emmett J. Scott and we find a man with a dilemma. A follower of Booker T. Washington, an educator with a lifetime of working for the cause of his fellow-African Americans, Scott had achieved a rare eminence for a man of colour in being appointed Special Assistant for Negro Affairs to the Secretary of War by the incoming President, Woodrow Wilson. His - to recruit African Americans to the war effort.", "As a result, the film originally supposed to be a response to Griffith, now envisaged as a major full-length film or epic proportions (not by an manner of means a low-budget film) and renamed The Birth of a Race (misleadingly increasing the false impression that it was a response to Griffith), was entirely placed in the hands of white film-makers, most of whom were already involved with producing war-propaganda. Scott's own involvement was nominal and no other African American was involved in any way with the production nor is there a single African American in the credited cast.", "The recruitment of black soldiers was a very minor aspect of the film, whose intention seems mainly to have been to keep anger at boiling-point against Germany (Ralph Dean who plays the Kaiser was one of several specialists in the role) while defusing prejudice against German Americans. The main plot (not present in the ten-minute fragment) concerns a German American family (two brothers who end up fighting on different sides). To judge from the cast-list, a sub-plot also concerned an Irish American family. Considerable care was taken to choose actors of German or Irish stock; Mary Carr, for instance, famous for playing \"mothers\" and whose maiden name was Kennavan, features as \"Mrs O'Brien). So it is a film that concerns itself greatly with the representation of minorities all except the largest minority of all - the African Americans!", "Far from being a response to Griffith, the rather vague religiose sentiments expressed with regard to equality and tolerance resemble quite closely those in D. W. Griffith's own 1916 film Intolerance, there are decidedly racist images of tribal peoples and even instances of white characters blacked up (as villains of course) while the original music for the film was by the same composer who produced the music for The Birth of a Nation.", "One has to wait until 1920 and Oscar Micheaux' Within Our Gates before there is a genuine response to the Griffith film."]},

This is a recurring note, as Derk Lane portrays the screenwriter who is constantly forced to do last-minute rewrites for director Randy West, causing him to neglect and annoy his wife played by Britt Morgan. (In-joke time: though the clapperboard reads \"F. J. Lincoln\" and we see Randy yell \"Cut!\" or \"Roll 'em!\" as the director, Randy's character name is R.

She has a great figure, and overall impresses.

(DVD box tries in vain to make it sound interesting, embellishing on the non-story in typically misleading fashion.) Her auntie June Desmond (played by well-nippled and obviously siliconed Barbie Dahl) is a widow, with boarder Winnifred Carmen (little-known NYC actress Adia) living in her building. That's the setting for extremely dull mate-swapping and bed-hopping, a far cry from Sarno's salad days exploiting the topic in the softcore '60s.", "The problem here, as with virtually all Joe's shot-on-video efforts, is a willful carelessness and defiant reluctance to set up most scenes properly. The prime directive of providing near-constant explicit sex is the culprit, and even the simplest of stagings quickly degenerates into a dreary \"wham bam\" porn filler format.", "Early example of this is when a Les Farrell arrives at the building, and Auntie June immediately has sex with him, no preamble whatsoever. Similarly when (via voice-over) Martina sends her \"old man\" (read: hubby) Carl over, Winnifred deep throats him without further ado.", "The fetishes/trademarks here are all the women keeping on high heels (otherwise nude) during the sex scenes, avoiding the \"dirty feet\" motif of so many porn junkers. Sexy stockings and garter belts are also de rigeur for a Sarno XXX video.", "Plot twists of who's sleeping with whom and what permanent arrangements will result are thoroughly uninteresting. The best thing about the film is undoubtedly Dahl's fellatio technique. Dare is not used properly, and Adia is simply not good looking.", "Just to conform to Sarno's #1 theme, Martina voices over how her mom told her once about having sex with her sister (Auntie June). This extraneous piece of info turns out to be relevant since Martina, natch, also wants to have sex with Auntie June, and sure enough we're treated to a lesbian threesome involving all the lead actresses.", "Video is bookended by Martina doing a short newscast in front of the \"Westpark Bldg. project\".

They're not the kind of actors you'd expect to see in this kind of film, and (hilariously enough, at least for me) every time this movie is on TV tons of letters are sent to the press and the TV station as to why are they showing this film, why there was no warning about what's in it and why did those two actors do this kind of film in the first place.", "So what's so traumatic ? I don't know how many people can bear to watch a jerry-lewis-style comedian being p***ed on, and the girl who used to teach alphabet getting raped and soddomized. On-screen. With nothing left for the imagination.", "Most people watch this movie for two reasons - one is expecting it to be a light comedy (considering the talent) and getting one major surprise. The knowledgeable others just want to see sex and violence with a surprising cast. This movie has a so-so plot but its mostly important for the constant controversy it generates and the questions about casting, both from the makers point of view as to how their film will be remembered and a star's choice to do certain uncharacteristic roles. Somehow, maybe this film survived in peoples' memories because of the cast and what said cast does, and if that was the creators' intention in casting, then even more debate arises."]},

Billy plays his \"Schmaltz\" character, a middle European stereotype, which he played in Roach comedies through 1934. I guess Roach knew that the Taxi series wasn't working and tried a couple of films to keep the Blue and Gilbert teaming going. (The other film is \"The Rummy\", which is not as good.) Besides the typical Roach slapstick, Ben and Billy engage in some verbal acrobatics similar to Abbott and Costello. However, the timing is slower, and it doesn't really work. After \"The Rummy\", Ben Blue returned to New York where he appeared in some Vitaphone shorts. Roach still tried to promote Billy as a leading comic doing his Schmaltz character or a variation of it. \"Apples to You\" and \"Music in Your Hair\" are particularly good short comedies from this period. Gilbert freelanced at most of the studios, even though he was a Roach regular. He even has a showy role in the later Roach comedy \"Blockheads\"."]},

While \"Police Story\" was a great police show, it reached a point of oversaturation. Additionally, NBC also kept moving the time slots for the show...which further increased the audience's apathy.

Because he could tell the cop was on the verge of a nervous breakdown and hypnotizing the guy would do no good. Instead, Sgt. Price (Robert Culp) pushes the impaired cop to make an i.d. On the perpetrators. And, in his condition, it's not surprising he picked two guys in the lineup and said they were the ones who shot him. His partner, Sgt. Bentley (Dennis Weaver) isn't sure at all but eventually backs off and the two men are convicted and sent to prison.", "A couple years pass. The real perpetrators are caught robbing a bank and their partner (played by Freddy Kruger, Robert Englund) tells cops that his two accomplices bragged about having \"cut a cop in half\" and Bentley is now worried that they blew the case and prosecuted two innocent men. As for his partner, Price does what he can to prevent the case from being reopened...and Bentley continues and uncovers more evidence. But no one seems to care...not his supervisors, not the judge...only Bentley. And so, despite being told to close the case, he's pressing ahead.", "This is a very good episode that brings up many good points. It also makes the police, judge and prosecutors look pretty bad...which is good if you want a show that doesn't just make the police look like angels. In other words, if you like realism, this is a really good show. Sad it wasn't seen for so long.", "*I know network standards at the time did NOT want programs to show any blood.

The dances chosen have a range of emotions and nicely showcase Britain's Royal Ballet and especially Margot Fonteyn, Rudolf Nureyev and David Blair. The choreography by Frederick Ashton, Michel Fokine, Rudolf Nureyev, and Marius Petipa is stunning. Nureyev's \"Le Corsaire\" is worth the price alone; he and Margot Fonteyn are absolutely amazing in their athletic abilities. \"Les Syphides\" and \"La Valse\" are reminiscent of the great Busby Berkeley musicals from the 1930s and 1940s in that every person on stage is meticulously placed and posed throughout every scene. The scenery provides beautiful, yet non-distracting, backdrops for the various ballets. And finally, the costumes. To quote my seven-year old daughter \"Their costumes are *glorious*!\" I heartily agree (specially during \"La Valse\" and \"The Sleeping Beauty\") they truly are lovely."]},

The soundtrack features a rich spectrum of Mediterranean music, jazz, funk, and ethnic funk performed by Israeli artists including an on-stage appearance of the African Hebrews.

Lapitch the Little Shoemaker mayn't be one of the best animated films ever made, but it is a great little gem and well worth the time if able to track down.", "The animation is beautifully done, wisely keeping it simple but never too safe or over-simple. The drawing is of smoother quality than those of the show (which still is of good quality visually), it's bright and colourful with some suitably dark atmospheric moments, the backgrounds are very detailed and rich in colour, atmosphere and quaint charm and some moments of outstanding imagination (like in the Dirty Rat musical number). There is some great music here too, the incidental music is whimsical, lively and sometimes haunting and the songs are really quite good, with the tender Take My Hand, the catchy Shoe Song and the rousing Farmers and Friends Forever. The best though is Dirty Rat's song, melodically it is both fun and sinister and coupled with some truly imaginative and wonderfully surreal visuals and characterful vocals, it is one of the better non-Disney animated villain songs to me.", "Lapitch the Little Shoemaker is very well written as well, not afraid to bring depth while also respecting its main target audience. It's immensely charming, entertaining and inspiring, with the humorous moments being well-judged and actually funny rather than dumb or juvenile and there are some valuable lessons and good ideas that the film shows without being heavy-handed at all. Some parts, like with Dirty Rat, are also dark, without being too frightening, Lapitch and Lisa's relationship is portrayed very charmingly here helped by that the two characters are also both likable, and the Scowlers' back story brings depth and poignancy to the film. The story is very well-thought out and eventful, while never feeling that the film is too rushed or stretched, it also tries to break away from any formulas which is admirable and doesn't feel convoluted or muddled at all.", "The characters are really engaging, Lapitch and Lisa are very easy to like, Brewster and Pico are amusing and sympathetic, the Scowlers are written well enough for their backstory to resonate to the extent that Master Scowler's initial attitude towards Lapitch is understandable and Dirty Rat is such an enjoyable villain and has some genuine menace. Melvin is quite well-rounded too. The voice work is very good, especially for that of Lapitch and Dirty Rat. My only small complaint actually is the little too convenient climax with Dirty Rat's defeat feeling too easy.", "Overall though, a great little gem, and while the show is seldom seen and was short-lived (with not as much depth as the film present) it is also good, just as charming, entertaining and inspiring and goes perfectly with the film it's spun off from. 9/10 Bethany Cox"]},

Here, the same format is used to present \"The Man's Angle\".", "Benchley again is both the lecturer and the male half of the couple whose experiences serve as illustrations of the foibles of a 'typical' wife. Besides the sketches, there is an added gag, as the lecturer continually stresses that these female traits are merely isolated examples that he has heard of, rather than general characteristics, with this then being used in the finale.", "In both of these features, the sketches satirize behavior that is entirely familiar, but the good timing makes it more amusing than it may have been on its own. And again, although in many respects the depictions border on stereotypes of the two genders, it is presented in Benchley's good-natured, low-key way, which keeps it from being harsh. It's a good job of creating humor out of situations that can cause unfortunate tensions, and out of material that can be belittling if approached in the wrong fashion.", "Of the two features, no doubt many viewers will find one of them funnier than the other, but after all that's part of the point to them.

Offensive versus defensive.

Using skillfully edited footage, Woody inserts himself amid real documentary footage of Nixon and Agnew. Some of the material is unbelievable--where ever did he get it? It also stars two of Woody's staples--Diane Keaton and Louise Lasser, and they are hilarious as well. It holds up to repeat viewings very well, and in fact one joke (involving the NY Times) is so funny that i laugh out loud every time i hear it. Woody's absolute disgust with Nixon comes through, and overall this special seems a tad more nasty than i think the Woodman is known for, which (to me) makes it even funnier. One of Woody's funniest movies, even if it is only about a half hour long. Find it on Ebay if you can!"]},

The reason I didn't laugh is that the movie is just rather lazy and never really had any good jokes about the material we're watching.

Gaius falls for beautiful servant girl Rhama (Ida Galli), much to the displeasure of Tullia (Susy Anderson), wife of the duplicitous governor, using an effigy to attack Gaius while accusing him of murdering her husband. The film comes alive whenever Barrymore is the focus, on a cavernous set with huge glaring idol at its center, papering over the listless backstabbing subplots left over from previous muscleman epics. Ida Galli, better known as Evelyn Stewart in later vehicles like \"The Murder Mansion,\" had previously graced Mario Bava's exemplary \"Hercules in the Haunted World,\" boasting none other than Christopher Lee as its blood drinking villain, while Susy Anderson recently essayed a more bland part in Bava's \"Black Sabbath.\" The climax must be ranked as a disappointment, using stock footage from Edgar G. Ulmer's 1959 \"Hannibal,\" the undead army appearing as transparent phantoms rather than a corporeal menace. Manni is no bare chested warrior, easily overshadowed by the flamboyant Barrymore and both female leads, the strong horror angle helping it stand out from a mostly routine pack, surpassed by Gordon Scott in \"Goliath and the Vampires.\""]},

It does not have the same great dialogue as the first two, nor the witty and playful tone. However, saying that, Scream 3 is probably still better than 95% of slasher films today. It has suspense and mystery, and although it sometimes goes overboard with how the script handled the 'actual' history of Maureen Prescott, I think it overall works well. Neve Campbell once again gives it all she has, and the supporting characters are actually well rounded, especially Parker Posey, which gives the film it's much needed humor. David Arquette and Courtney Cox are both solid, but I cannot help but question how much their characters( or maybe their motivation as actors) changed, since it really does seem that both feel awkward in a lot of scenes. I suspect it is the writing since a lot of their brilliant dialogue from Scream 2 was missing. Saying that, and while it is true that it is the weakest of the trilogy, it is still a lot of fun and does have it's clever moments here and there. I do not think there can ever really be a 'bad' Scream film."]},

One earlier example of the genre is Ossi Elstelä's musically titled Serenaadiluutnantti from the late 1940s.", "The plot is borderline non-existent and the story is mainly built around catchy songs and stereotypical characters doing what they always do: two traveling performers named Oinas and Holopainen (Henry Theel and Ossi Elstelä) accidentally end up in an Army base after boarding a wrong bus. Penniless and without a much better place to go, they decide to spend a few days posing as recruits in order to enjoy the free food and accommodation. Of course, their immediate superior Staff Sergeant Mäkimies (Kalle Viherpuu) is a raging but gullible hard-ass, the women in the barracks (Sinikka Koskela and Siiri Angerkoski) cause some romantic tension and the laid-back \"recruits\" manage to play pranks and avoid any kind of work like professionals.", "The good-voiced star singer Henry Theel and the chubby Savo-speaking Ossi Elstelä do their parts well, even though the plot hardly calls for master-class actors. The songs are pretty fun and by far the best part of the movie, especially near the beginning during the variety show that features some flashy acrobatic dancing, Theel telling jokes in a little girl's voice and the legendary children's favourite Markus-setä as a host. In fact, they really should have saved the show scene for the ending, since the ordinary schlagers that we hear later on do not have the same exhilarating effect as the dancing and juggling. Another option, of course, would have been to fill the whole runtime with numbers like that instead of spending it with unimaginative bumbling and romantic misunderstandings.", "As a big fan of movie musicals I just cannot give the film a rating of less than five stars out of ten but I must note that if it was not for the songs, there really would not be much to see. Well, the natural folksy charisma of Elstelä and Angerkoski is pretty alright and the movie seems to understand its meager status since the runtime has been limited to mere 75 minutes. To close the review with a last sentence mini-summary of my thoughts: musical fans may enjoy this one; others may just as well skip it."]},

This was a period when Bob Steele (real name Robert Adrian Bradbury) began making films his father (real name Ronald N. Bradbury, though he went by Robert, Sr. and his son for a while Robert, Jr.) directed. It's too bad that this film wasn't directed by his father! Instead, it was directed by half-way decent cinematographer Bert Glennon in his last attempt at direction. Glennon also cut the picture, and the editing is miserable. Too bad, too. Because this is actually a rather good story, and it's a fun film to watch - up to a point. The point is that some things are so obviously in need of cutting or better acting or better editing or better direction in general that the film ends up muddled throughout. For example, this is a typical \"B\" Western, and the horsemanship is always of great importance. There were lots of horse spills in these things, though those were rarely, if ever shown, unless they furthered the plot or were written in beforehand. In \"South of Santa Fe\" we have three (!) horse spills, and each of them is obviously NOT planned, but kept as part of the plot. One would have sufficed. Two would have been okay...probably. But the third was too much. It filled up the time, though. The entire film is exactly 60 minutes to the second.", "The film stars Bob Steele, Janis Elliott, Ed Brady, Eddie Dunn, Gordon De Main, Chris-Pin Martin, Al Ernest Garcia, and others. I kept looking at Janis Elliott, wondering where I'd seen her before. Then it occurred to me that she looked remarkably like Merle Oberon. Trouble is, Merle Oberon was making films in England in 1932. And - this was the only film Janis Elliott ever made. That's a good thing, too. She was absolutely gorgeous, and simply as bad an actress as I've ever seen. Her line readings were embarrassing to watch.", "Elliott's father, played by John Elliott (no relation), is killed by Ed Brady, and Brady steals a map of where a very good mine is. But, as he's stealing the map out of Janis Elliott's hand it rips in two, and he leaves with only half the map. The rest of the show - littered with comedy bits, some very good, some just overly done or lame because of bad direction, not bad acting - or even bad comedy - plays out against this beginning, Bob Steele eventually solving all, of course - and getting the girl in a final scene that is utterly not believable - AT ALL!!", "Still, even with all the criticism - and it's deserved - I liked the show. How do you like that?! It's on a pretty good Alpha Video DVD, but it certainly isn't pristine..."]},

The idea of a Yeti in Mexico is rather laughable but I let that go and was enjoying the film until the Yeti finally showed up. The film runs only 70-minutes but the monster doesn't show up until after 50-minutes so we've got a lot of talk and build up for the monster. When the monster finally shows up the look of him is rather disappointing. It looks more like a polar bear outfit and it certainly comes off more cute than scary. The performances are fairly good and the direction keeps the film moving well but there's no question people are going to be disappointed that the monster doesn't have more action. The ending involves a Mexican guy trying to do karate on the thing, which does manage a few laughs. There's a lot of dialogue in the film including one member of the family trying to talk to the Yeti but I couldn't figure out any of it due to the lack of subs."]},

This certainly isn't among their best work but I think fans of the duo should laugh enough to make this worth sitting through. The documentary aspect is what I found most interesting not because of the \"art\" but because of who is doing it.

None of them seem very enthusiastic due to events past, but since it's free and they can all catch-up with each other after a year or so they decide to go for it.", "Later, when they're all there, tensions start building and people are at each other's throats over the \"death\" that happened last time they stayed at camp. The main character's boyfriend knows nothing of it, so some girls explain it to him - his girlfriend's mentally-challenged brother was burnt to death in a barn out front. We get a nice flashback that tells the whole story, except what the hell actually caused him to self-combust. The brother wanders into the shed in a sulk and inexplicably looks up to see a flashing red light, which makes him scream. Why? Next thing you know he bursts out of the barn on fire, and his sister appears from nowhere screaming in slow motion. Reeling from the news, the boyfriend is wary of the days ahead...", "A few minutes later one of the couples is murdered in the same barn; no one notices. The next morning, more are murdered - no one notices. Each time a character disappears and is killed, no one knows they are gone, and when someone is asked of their whereabouts, they reply with some noncommittal answer. Some friends, eh? The killer is exposed as some half-human, half-beast creature that growls like a drowning zombie. Tracking him (apparently he's been there the whole time the group were last at camp) is the ground's caretaker, an Indian descendant who's ancestors were burned at the stake by Civil War soldiers. He claims one of them put a curse on the campground, and thinks this thing is the result. The film makes great play of hiding his motives... is he actually the killer or is he just out to stop the real one? He spends all of his time screaming and threatening the group and at one point nearly bursts into tears in front of one couple about his kittens - \"I NEED 'EM!\" he shouts.", "Also coming on the scene later is the town sheriff, whom one of the girls manages to call before getting killed. He arrives in his old, '50s-vintage rust bucket that he had to get his granddaughter to help him fix in an earlier scene while a random African-American man sat watching in disbelief! I couldn't help but join him! Didn't the County Sheriff's department see fit for him to have a proper police vehicle? He's also very old and spends nearly a minute examining two victims in the dark before deciding to do something about it. He doesn't do much. At the end the killer is exposed as someone we know and the lead female character has something to do with it. Can her new boyfriend and the miserable old caretaker stop them in time before all are lost? Barely. The film also fails to tie up all loose ends, such as motive and what the hell exactly happened to the brother. Was it the old Indian curse or what that made him self-combust? This kind of writing affects the film badly. It is a shoddy mess, with what looks like a lot of ad-libbing and last-minute ideas. How someone could fund such a screenplay is beyond me. The characters are typical wannabees who think they're all so cool and spend their time doing nothing but drinking and moaning. I did like that older, mustached guy though. Can't remember the name. He drove the silver Ford Thunderbird that had sugar in the gas tank (another lame plot point). A lot of his lines are actually genuinely funny, although the scene where he snaps at the cabin and goes off at everyone, screaming \"You're an asshole! F@#% you! And your brother was an asshole too! I'm glad he's dead!\", etc is unintentionally hilarious. I was rolling around at that scene. The other actors just stare at him and you can tell one girl is trying not to laugh. Great stuff.", "The same unfortunately cannot be said for the technical side of the film. The direction is uninspired and dull. Lighting in a lot of the scenes is poor and I don't know what was going on with the music, I don't even remember it. The gore scenes were fairly effective, though some parts defy belief (the first victim flying up in slow motion in the barn). There was quite a bit of blood and also some nudity, which never hurts. I also have to say that the acting is pathetic, although it looks like some of them really did try. It just didn't make a difference. The script however was the worst, and the fact that the director didn't do anything about it and fix the mistakes ruined the film. Not as bad as some of them, but not the best of the '80s slashers either. You can do much better in terms of sheer entertainment value.", "Oh yeah, that ice shed was pathetic, too. Stocked year-round when no one has been there for over a year and ice is still in large, perfect blocks even with a hatch in the roof wide open and no obvious refrigeration source. The girl who is trapped in there also goes into hysterics after ten seconds, even though she thinks her friends did it... See what I mean about the acting?"]},

As is typical in such houses (and not merely in Germany), there is a rigid status system among the servants: the lowliest among them is the chambermaid (Lucie Englisch) who is married to the household's chauffeur (Hans Brausewetter). The chambermaid came to the city from a Bavarian village; her husband has never met her relatives. At the top of the food chain in the servants' quarters is the brawny battle-axe housekeeper (Senta Söneland).", "During her employment, the maid has frequently sent letters home to her widowed father (from this address) but has never told him that she is employed as a maidservant.", "The master and mistress of the house go away on holiday, but they inform the servants that the master's rich father (also a widower) will be coming to visit in their absence. Naturally, he is to be given every possible hospitality and consideration.", "Shortly after the mistress and her husband depart, along comes a stout respectable-looking man. But he isn't the master's rich father: he's actually the father of the chambermaid. This very posh house is his daughter's address, so he assumes that she's the mistress here. And all the other servants assume that the maid's father is the expected wealthy visitor. The maidservant sees no reason to disabuse anyone of their errors: she contrives to masquerade as the mistress of the household (to impress her father) whilst convincing her husband and her fellow servants that her provincial father is actually the wealthy father-in-law of the household's true mistress.", "Naturally, there are no end of farcical complications. The heavy-set unattractive housekeeper tries to vamp the 'wealthy' houseguest, not realising who he really is ... and that he has no money. Senta Söneland gives a deft performance as the housekeeper, who pursues her romantic objective with the same brisk efficiency she applies to her household duties. Despite her evident talent as an actress, Söneland was a very unattractive woman who had serious health problems; she committed suicide a few years after this movie was made. Her performance in this film reminds me of the American character actresses Minerva Urecal and Marjorie Main (neither of whom I ever liked); Söneland is similar to both of them yet more talented than either.", "By far, the standout performance in this film is given by the actor who plays the chambermaid's father: none other than Szöke Szakall, the Hungarian Jewish character actor who later fled Europe (one step ahead of the Nazis) and had a fondly-remembered career in Hollywood under the name S.Z. Sakall in films such as 'Yankee Doodle Dandy' and 'Casablanca'. In 'The Unknown Guest', Sakall demonstrates many of the little physical crotchets that would stand him in such excellent stead during his Hollywood years. He shakes his jowls, clutches his face, wipes his brow while muttering desperately. What a delightful piece of Hungarian ham! (Although, in deference to Sakall's religion, perhaps 'ham' is not the best word for him.)", "I wish that someone could explain something for me. Many reference books refer to S.Z. Sakall as 'Cuddles' Sakall, claiming that he was billed by this nickname in some of his Hollywood films. I've seen several of Sakall's American films, yet I've never seen one in which this fine actor is billed as 'Cuddles'. Can someone please either verify this rumour or end it once for all?", "I'll rate 'The Unknown Guest' 6 points out of 10, for the fine performance of Szöke Szakall and for the splendid support by Senta Söneland."]},

Up until that time, the war was depicted in very negative and anti-British terms with efforts like \"Sink The Belgrano\" (the British as war-mongers) and \"Tumbledown\" (the British army treats its men with contempt). This is a more balanced effort, and is all the better for it. The Falkland Islands and its people are depicted as a quaint, small town British community, almost like a corner of Somerset or Yorkshire. They live a life that almost embodies an earlier, stereotypical 1950's way far removed from cosmopolitan London. The theme of the film is that of violation. When the Argentinians threaten to invade, the locals close ranks and prepare for the worst; even though they're not sure what that will entail. The Royal Marines, professional to the last, won't give in that easily; they don't want their honour violated. The DJ refuses to have his station violated, the defenders of Government house don't even want the vegetable patch violated. The Argentinians are not the focus of the story and their point of view isn't really delved into; suffice to say General Mendoza comes across as a reasonable person, but a few of his officers are shown as brutal thugs who can't wait to impose their ways on the islanders.", "The film came out when anti-Thatcher bias in the British media was high, and it's not an anti-Thatcher piece at all. It goes a little into the British seeming to reduce their commitment to the islands at the beginning, but the impression I was left with was that the islanders were absolutely horrified to be taken over by Argentina. It pits the olde-worlde British village life against the Banana Republic army boot. The acting is first rate (have Ian Richardson or the late lamented Bob Peck ever put in a bad performance?) and the production values are very good."]},

I've already reviewed another one of these before, \"Boo\" (also from 1932), which employed Universal's copy of \"Nosferatu\" (1922) to combine it with footage from the more recent \"The Cat Creeps\" (1930) and \"Frankenstein\" (1931). Meanwhile, \"The Unshod Maiden\" regurgitates Lois Weber's 1916 feature \"Shoes.\" So radical was the shift at the time to synchronized-sound production, that the silent films of only a decade or two ago were now being trotted out in adulterated form to be mocked. No wonder, then, if some might have believed that the silent era was little more than sped-up Keystone Kops slapstick.", "Just imagine if, say, Warner Bros. trotted out \"The Dark Knight\" (2008) re-edited as a short for HBO Max, not only as one of those CinemaSins YouTube videos, but also to make fun of how supposedly-primitive movies were back in those days--even to have been shot on celluloid, without 3D or much CGI and to be seen in theatres--and with whatever today's equivalent is of wisecracking puns such as, \"Alas, shoes came high in those days. In fact, they came half way up the calf, and that's no bull.\" And, that's the only way you could see \"The Dark Knight,\" such being the case in 1932 in the days before TV and home video, let alone streaming. Films were nothing but a product to be briefly consumed before being disposed of--at most for another product, such as \"The Unshod Maiden,\" before it was thrown away, too.", "OK, maybe a joke here or there isn't awful (e.g. \"He says there are 82 million men out of work and soon Congress is going to make it unanimous\"), but they all come and go so quickly, throwaway lines to be treated as disposable as the filmmakers behind this treated celluloid itself that none of them are given an opportunity to land. Even a belch sound effect is added, for crying out loud. Besides, the smart aleck narration hardly matches the 1916 footage, biased as I may be from having just seen the social-problem drama \"Shoes.\"", "The only potential benefit I see with this cannibalization was that it might've inadvertently saved some silent-film footage, so mistreated was celluloid otherwise, too. The only bit of \"The Cat Creeps,\" for instance, that exists today is from \"Boo.\" Some of \"The Unshod Maiden,\" as well, was put back into the restoration of \"Shoes.\" This is nitrate film that the studios may have otherwise intentionally and unintentionally burned, thrown away, or otherwise left to rot--even had they donated it to a venerable institution for preservation. It's not as though the Academy, the Museum of Modern Art, etc., haven't already lost films they held to deterioration and misplacement (just look at the tragedy of Colleen Moore's films, which she donated to MoMa, only for them to be left to decay), or that there still isn't a full accounting of materials held in the various vaults throughout the world today. That's it, though; \"The Unshod Maiden\" is otherwise contemptable, with the intention of such gags in the first place having been the destruction of those films."]},

The questions tackle a wide range of topics from what you do call the inhabitants at the South Pole to what direction you travel if you're going from the Atlantic to the Pacific via the Panama Canal. You also get a question about how many pieces of hair are on a woman's head. Somewhere along the way something went wrong because all of the questions are supposed to add up to 100 points but only 90 are available so I'm going to guess that one of the ten-point questions were dropped or perhaps that was just a joke to make those in the audience wonder where that missing question went. Overall this is a pretty entertaining entry in the series but obviously your level of interest is going to depend on whether you'd want to answer questions before watching a movie. I think the series is entertaining and I'm sure those people back in the day had a good time screaming their thoughts out at the screen. I think the clock that ticks down the seconds is a rather annoying touch but it's not bad enough to where it kills the rest of the film. The final joke in the film is certainly a winner."]},

The central theme is the collapse of the marriage of Jan and Tom Howard, who - despite their difficulties - continue to be devoted to each other. I believe that the producers' original intention was to show their passage from divorce through a variety of affairs back to reconciliation.", "The second and parallel theme of the series is the story of Jan and Tom's upstanding son Leo Howard and his touching on-and-off relationship with a girl from the neighbourhood, Abby Urquhart. If Jan and Tom were to be reunited despite all the ups and downs, then it would be logical to expect a similar conclusion for the younger couple. ", "Unfortunately in the aftermath of the sad demise of Maurice Colbourne who played Tom Howard, the production suffered from chaotic, hastily rewritten ideas. Jan was paired off with some other, less exciting partners, while Abby inexplicably morphed from a relatively level-headed albeit dour young woman into a devious business tycoon and a total monster. ", "The story of Leo and Abby begins as perhaps the most heart-warming thread in the series. How could the scriptwriters let us down so badly?", "I still believe that, had the series continued, the final outcome could have somehow brought these two together again - slowly and painfully (can you imagine all those other delicious twists and turns?), but eventually for good. After all, somewhere half way through the series, Abby states quite resolutely that Leo is her ideal partner for life - and throughout Series 5 and 6, there are strong hints that she does not trust Orrin after all and may even be double-crossing him... oh, bliss! I like to think there was going to be more to the story than we were allowed to see. The creator of the series, Gerard Glaister, left some notes in which he envisaged series 7, which did not materialize. Thus it is reasonable to believe that the actual story remains unfinished and the aim of the last series was to prepare the viewers for more twists and surprises. I cannot resist imagining something like a collapse of the Hudson empire, Abby's return to England with her sons and her attempts to win Leo's trust and affection back. That way the final toast to the Howards would have been so much more satisfying."]},

He had already directed a melodrama, 'David Golder', with Harry Baur, then the outstanding (at least for the editing, if not for the story) 'The Five Accursed Gentlemen', both in 1931.", "So, after 'great' (and somehow heavy) melodrama and exotic adventures flick, Duvivier is now entering another genre, some sort of ciné-roman, a sentimental story. But in flying colors!", "First, the story. Simple and complicated in its details, but easy to follow for the viewer, it is tightly waterproofed. Duvivier shows there his trademark respect for the audience.", "Then, the means. The score is not the movie forte, though it's not negligible nor boring. Once again, it is the editing which make the job. Many sequences are based on short cuts giving fast pace: the evocation of the main protagonists' work (the telephone linking the world together), the Paris tour (with recurrent gags), the solemn arrival of the 'President of the Trans-oceanic Republics' in Berlin under a driving rain, the official banquet, the final brawl. Through frames and cinematography, some images are testimonials to German impressionism. And the actors. They have the age of their parts (Josette Day was 18, Wolfgang Klein 20) and they act the way it has to be done in talking movies, already far from silent movies habits. (Nevertheless, you'll notice that the movie is almost entirely understandable without any sound: Duvivier gives a great importance to the writings, letters, telegrams, signs in the street, train station boards, clocks.) The rest of the cast is up to the task: Germaine Aussey, Karel Stepanek and Hans Henninger the Berlin pals, and Charles Redgie, in one of his usual parts seen elsewhere (Maurice Tourneur's 'Samson', Yves Mirande's 'Café de Paris'), verging to slapstick, but noir-ish, this time.", "Finally, the meanings. All Duvivier's obsessions and concerns are already here. Innocence lost (the —litteral— deception of the heroes but also the strange insert of this 'president-king' surrounded by his many wives-virgins), loneliness in modern times (the 'Automat' restaurant in Berlin, the song in Montmartre cabaret and its effect on the audience), modern forms of consented slavery (work in the telephone centrals, stupid mass touring in Paris), and last but not least, the need and power of love (the song in Montmartre —the Christ is not that surprising, it's a wooden statue not misplaced here, a 'haut lieu' of artistry—, the happy resolution, which is not contrived and has many aspects, since not only Lily needs to forgive and show she's willing to, but Annette has the same though a bit twisted need for love, through seduction, and is too happy to see her former lover come back to her).", "The movie takes us through an early thirties Paris (and then in a 'decaying' Berlin), and uses opposite or at least very different locations to contrasts the characters and their goals: 'Le Bal nègre' for Annette who tries to seduce Erich, 'Le Lapin à Gill' where Lily brings Max (she thinks he is Erich) and where is heard the song, 'Chanson lasse', our friend dbdumonteil told us about. (By the way, mon cher Didier, this is not the first mention of Duvivier's name inside the movie: the 'pneumatique' —sort of telegram— Annette is sending to her lover Dumont has \"rue Duvivier\" for subscribed address!)", "Among the bizarre and/or funny inserted pieces, there is also this sequence with the 'Trans-oceanic' orchestra —after using German, then French, then English, the understanding will come through the 'Trans-oceanic' language, obviously invented, a moment that predates one of the funniest scenes of Guitry's 'The Pearls of the Crown'.", "Well, that's enough to say my point: the third talkie directed by Duvivier is already a masterpiece, with great inventive editing, arch-efficient pace and tightness of the story-telling for this ciné-roman already full of Duvivier's vision and visions.", "A powerful romance.", "NB: I see on the IMDb page that the music of 'Chanson lasse' is here attributed to Armand Bernard (a French character actor of the funny kind who knew how to write good music too), but in the movie, during the sequence in 'Le Lapin à Gill\", the Montmartre cabaret, it is announced like this: \"lyrics of Julien Duvivier, music by Karol Rathaus\", the author of the film score.", "(Didier_fort at hotmail.com)"]},

The self-confident teacher isn't easy to woo though, as she is determined to save the school from being closed by earning extra money as a singer. The other staff members of the school aren't all enthusiastic about Thompson's antics but the financial situation forces them to play along.", "Besides Thompson's romantic advances, the comedy is mainly based on the characters trying to hide the truth from each other: Tuula doesn't want to be known as a singer, the school's janitor Napoleon (Aku Korhonen) tries to keep his second job a secret and the headmistress (Aino Lohikoski) wouldn't want to reveal the lack of money to Thompson.

Also, I feel the ending comes across as too hasty, considering the characters' nature and behaviour before. Fans of old Finnish comedies should enjoy the movie alright though."]},

Kyne, \"To Him Who Dares\" (misidentified as \"Dared\" upon IMDb's page for the film), this is one of at least 110 works written by Kyne that have been rendered into cinema. Kyne, an enormously fecund and popular writer whose output flourished primarily between 1915 and 1940, was so well-received by his reading audience that it was often stated all he needed to do in order to be published was to merely submit a piece for publication. It is, therefore, no surprise that his name is above the title of this somewhat fragmented comedy drama that yet is marked by thoroughly proficient contributions from all those involved in its making. The IMDb synopsis for the film is composed by ever competent Les Adams and neatly outlines the movie in its essentials. As action begins, youthful would-be newsreel photographer Don Mallory (Frankie Darro), along with his girl friend Jean (June Johnson), is watching dramatic examples of footage shot by his older brother Cliff (Kane Richmond), an established news cameraman, and after Jean remarks at how risky such an occupation must be that records dangerous events and history in the making, Don provides the picture's title as response to her: \"Yeah....that's the newsreel business. Anything for a thrill.\" It is clear that Don will need only a slim excuse to follow in his brother's vocational footsteps instead of attending college, Cliff's choice for him. A camera shy socialite, Betty Kelley (Ann Evers), has not been filmed through the medium of news reporting, having evaded all efforts to do so, and the plot line depicts attempts by the Mallory pair to shoot her on film, with Cliff being assigned for that purpose by his employer,a newsreel company. Initially outwitted by Kelley and her protective entourage, Cliff and Don, abetted by doughty Jean, then steal onto the luxurious Kelley family estate with an aim to pictorially record Betty for posterity, in spite of a raft of guards that apparently should be too great an obstacle for the brothers to surmount. About this same time, always curious Don observes a bank robbery in progress, and films the incident, thereby not surprisingly serving to upset the ringleader of the bandits, who also, in true Hollywood melodrama fashion, just happens to be Kelley's fiancé, a hardened con man who has been posing as an English earl (Johnstone White), and the chase is soon on as the Forces of Evil endeavour to seize the incriminating film made during the robbery by the younger Mallory. The role of Don Mallory is prototypical of Darro's characterizations, and it is gratifying to watch him perform in his customary part as gutsy underdog, while a viewer additionally ought not overlook his acrobatic skills as he nimbly performs all of his part's stunts for this film that was very popular upon its original release to theatres. Johnson's playing helps to create giddy comedic episodes for a cleverly crafted screenplay that is efficiently directed by Les Goodwins, a veteran at helming such low-budget productions."]},

It wasn't such a nice experience but it was a memorable one. ", "10 star rating for it? I don't think so! I'm still about to see a really great documentary about this dark era. It deserves praise and recognition for showing how powerful the cinema media can be, can survive through decades and years and have great things to say about one people and a nation. In the end, the film lasted while the regime haven't, it was dying when this film was started again. 7/10"]},

He displays the best acting skills of the group, good enough to actually go mainstream. He is the main character in this movie and his exploits are both theatrical and hilarious! The actual candy strippers display terrible acting (as expected). Yet, I'll go as far as saying that it actually adds to this movie. Why? Because the cheese-factor is definitely an element of movies from the era. People used to today's movies of the genre may be disappointed because it doesn't jump right into the action. Time is taken to develop the plot. Real fans will appreciate the character development, making the numerous action scenes that much more enjoyable. This is almost as good as some of the b-movies of the same era. It's humorous,cheesy, and action-packed! It's a classic!"]},

Not that it matters much, since Gabriel's not above sharing the wealth as the opening scene with Diane Dubois (a/k/a notorious Paris nightclub owner Denise Lascène) illustrates, complete with then still in-habitual double penetration. Still, François agrees to seek help from very hands on psychologist Diane (beautiful Erika Cool, whose path often crossed with that of a then promising young starlet known as Brigitte Lahaye in Claude Pierson's melodramatic A COEUR OUVERT and Robert Renzulli's equally lachrymose CATHY, FILLE SOUMISE) who immediately sets up a phone sex scenario with her assistant Lili (ravishing Morgane, despite the hairstyle) who's receiving in person attention from Gabriel just a few doors down. The director throws in a charming reference to his own hardcore debut, LA FESSEE, as François repeats that film's protagonist Monsieur Antoine's spanking philosophy (\"every spanking starts with a caress\") ad verbatim. ", "The rest of the movie somewhat unimaginatively details the \"tests\" François undergoes as part of his erotic assertiveness therapy, meaning Diane picks a target and lets her pupil loose on her. A glowingly youthful Céline Gallone (who would specialize in schoolgirl parts in Claude Mulot's sparkling LES PETITES ECOLIERES and Gérard Grégory's vastly underrated ADOLESCENTES AU PENSIONAT) appears in the most erotic segment by far, as a young girl whose parents are away for the weekend, highlighted by a breathtakingly fetishist extreme close-up of her perfect nipple rising to aroused attention ! The frustrated housewife masturbating with the telephone is played by Gallia, who also appeared in the same director's disposable DEFONCE-MOI, and sad-eyed Marie-Dominique Cabannes (one of Bernard-Aubert's VEUVES EN CHALEUR) brings up the rear with another double penetration demonstration courtesy of our horny heroes. ", "Though there's a distinct lack of creativity on the carnal front, at least it's prettily photographed by productive Pierre Fattori, whose professional expertise made him a favorite crossover companion for fornication filmmakers whenever they dabbled in the mainstream : Bernard-Aubert with his scathing anti-war manifesto CHARLIE BRAVO, Pierre Unia with the dire soft porn thriller BABY CAT and the late Alain Payet on the painfully unfunny farce L'EMIR PREFERE LES BLONDES."]},

I suppose getting into the biz on the ground floor, before any standards had been established, was his trick, and crony-ism did the rest.", "He unwisely cast himself in the leading role, stumbling in his poor delivery of his own dialog (including longueurs when he can't think of anything to say to the girls in even the simplest of exposition scenes).

Giving her an assignment, he calls Thomasina \"Connie\" by mistake, and in fact \"Harriet\" turns out to be Hari for the duration. The only amusing moment for me over the course of an hour of footage was Margold \"inventing\" the Post-it (not on the market till a year later): carefully putting scotch tape on little notes describing deliveries, and sticking them up on a calendar board on his wall.", "1-shot tall & busty actress \"Dusty Darling\" as Thomasina drives her VW van to give chemicals to a \"scientist\" (he has a typewriter as his equipment! -talk about low-budget props).

Reynolds). Sands deserved another shot at stardom under the tutelage of a real director: she's a cutie with beautiful breasts.", "When they return, Margold takes out his wrath on Diedre, tying her up spread-eagled on his bed and forcing her to have sex. He cums on her face, though his dick remains flaccid throughout the scene.", "The gals' return trip to their clients is more of the same, though Tortuga has a three-some when a doorman joins her and Manning, while Diedre is quite condescending to Reynolds. She takes a couple of tentative sucks at his cock, and eats a banana instead, huffily throwing the peel on his crotch and leaving. This pointless scene is typical Margold-filler: not amusing and making sense to him alone.", "More to the point is the trio's torturing Margold for the finale. They tie him up to his bed, whip him and humiliate him by stuffing one of their red shorts (actually panties) as uniform in his mouth, and then tying a bow with another around his limp cock. Margold clearly gets off on this sort of nonsense, but it is just another audience insult in my book.", "Film is poorly photographed and the sex scenes bear zero arousal value, other than a chance to see three attractive ladies.

On occasion, a veteran or newcomer to the business would try it out & see if it fit, as it were. So we did get to see the likes of Ali Moore & Stevie Taylor do their first anal scenes. In Ali's case, her only such scene was in CFB 3. In Stevie's, CFB 3 was the first of many. So it is in this offering. Carol Titian loses her on-screen anal virginity to Peter North & Lisa DeLeeuw loses hers to Billy Dee. (I recall seeing Lisa De do an anal scene in an earlier loop, so the claim that this was her first such on screen scene is dubious. Also, the unconfirmed belief that she died of AIDS could be seen as evidence of those afore mentioned consequences) This was also one of Rachel Ryan's first films in which her posterior was violated and in her case, it was definitely a match made in heaven.

In retrospect we get it because she has been rediscovered (by ABA), her tribute DVD issued in the same release as this film's package devoted to Casey Lorraine. Casey appears as one of the femme prisoners, but makes little impact this time out."]},

It is naturally set in a hotel where maids Valerie Marron (redhead) and Mary Stuart (haircut as if auditioning to play Joan of Arc) decide they are so underpaid (probably true of not just their characters but the actresses themselves) they might as well start servicing the guests for a bigger payoff.", "This sets in motion a comedy of errors and mistaken identity that is hardly worth chronicling or even summarizing, but is fast-paced, well-acted, and loaded with the necessary triple X content. My favorite '70s porn starlet Leslie Murray pops up as a newlywed, looking great as usual, with a sandy-haired young Eric Edwards, early in his feature career (post-loops). Eric delivers three money shots, the last one perhaps faked or doubled per the choppy editing of an otherwise nice print used for DVD transfer, but he is oddly stoic and even bored-looking while having sex. Perhaps he was still between who-cares loops and Sarno/Findlay stardom. ", "Rest of the cast is more animated, as substitutions (Marron drops out of the film early on, a bit cryptically but not harmfully) and impersonations multiply. Some of the central gimmickry revolves around Levi Richards, a hotel guest satisfied with one of the maids who arranges a party later that night, to impress his big client Jeffrey Hurst and get latter to sign on the dotted line. Hurst's better half Andrea True visits the hotel, is mistaken for a maid while wearing a disguise (ugly wig and dark glasses), and later even Leslie Murray gets confused for a maid causing no end of complications.", "After a very large number of sex scenes (many cross-cut for variety), the confusion gets sorted out in whirlwind fashion in the final reel, leading to a very satisfying ending closeup of Levi staring in disbelief at what his minor foible has wrought, and a most diverting little triple-Xer comes to a halt.", "Major drawback in this otherwise entertaining piece of fluff is the musical track, which has three songs, one a sax solo, another Wes Montgomery style guitar piece plus a fairly lame imitation of Tijuana Brass doing \"Look of Love\", all 3 stretched beyond all comprehension. Each one is played between five and and eight times (I lost count), pure torture. The last time I heard such a stunt of repetitiousness goes back to my youth - Tom Clay, a great Canadian deejay at CKLW in Windsor Ontario used to play the Rolling Stones cover of \"Mona\" off their debut British album over and over (this was 1964), sometimes all night long, and the hypnotic sound has stayed with me ever since."]},

In one of these rare adult films, we have a film with a substantial plot, good production values, quality performances (especially by Ashlyn Gere; although it is a bit hard to understand Rocco Siffredi at times, a wonderful soundtrack and scorching sex. In other words, Chameleons is the kind of film that every adult film should aspire to be. For those familiar with John Leslie's 1989 video Chameleon this film is indirectly related with people who can transform shape, form, and even sex to fulfill their sexual appetites. The plot is also similar to the 1983 Tony Scott film The Hunger. I don't want to reveal too many plot details but the film is basically a love triangle between wealthy couple Claudine (the exquisite Deidre Holland) and Reynaldo (Rocco Siffredi) and the abrasive Casey (Ashlyn Gere), who becomes obsessed with them after meeting them in a sex club. The film eventually becomes a battle of wits of who's fooling who to the point where even the viewer isn't sure. The late John Leslie had a reputation of being the first person to successfully transition over from actor to director and this film is a perfect example of why. Every shot of the film demonstrates that Leslie was a true auteur and in my humble opinion, is only second to Henry Paris (Radley Metzger) in making adult films that can stand on their own without the sex (although that is certainly watchable as well). If pressed for my favorite John Leslie movie this would easily be my choice and if pressed for my favorite adult film ever made it, I think I would have to settle on a tie between this and The Opening of Misty Beethoven."]},

It's up to Toby and her friends Sally (Vanessa Del Rio with extremely plucked eyebrows) and Keith (Alan Marlow, the title character's husband in Radley Metzger's PRIVATE AFTERNOONS OF PAMELA MANN) to make up for the deficit by auctioning off their bodies to the highest bidder. Huh ? Well, there is rather more to the story but this is quite honestly the gist of it. Hey, I said it had plot. I didn't say it was good. As a matter of fact, it trails off in a different direction at every turn with sex taking a back seat on most occasions. For instance, someone actually managed to cast real life twins Brooke and Taylor Young (seen to better advantage in Carter Stevens' TEENAGE TWINS and DOUBLE YOUR PLEASURE) for a group scene involving Vanessa and some unappealing male who's supposed to be the girls' father. This potentially sulfurous sequence is however rudely interrupted after about two minutes' worth of action by the character of Del Rio's jealous husband, leading to an admittedly well-acted heart to heart that unfairly has to make up for the lack of a full sex scene. Same thing for the weird psychodrama bit with Keith and his carping middle-aged wife who goes berserk when her husband jacks off on the TV screen. Bits like these might work well in addition to well-crafted carnality but hardly instead of them. Likewise, viewers trying to figure out the complex narrative might not immediately realize that an actress as appealing and, it has to be said, accomplished as Jordan doesn't get naked until the final ten minutes or that there's a lack of explicit coverage in her single sex scene with Costello at the end. ", "Not all is lost however. Every now and then Ben does let a sexual encounter play out from start to finish, the best of which being the disco tussle with Marlow and the divine Annie Sprinkle (a veritable legend in her own lifetime as star of screen, stage, written page and what not) that turns into a hot little group with the addition of Vanessa and late funny man Bobby Astyr with Del Rio supplying the sandwich action. The brightly colorful cinematography is some of the best I've seen on these low to no budget New York grinders and the framing device with Costello's smitten company detective interrogating Toby aboard a sports plane in full flight over some startling scenery definitely adds a touch of class. A final ironic touch sees all this plot Ben has so carefully orchestrated jettisoned for a tired orgy finale with only Vanessa displaying the necessary verve."]},

I was aware Rosenthal had been a writer on Coronation Street back when it started but other than that I didn't know a great and never really watched any of his stuff at the time of release. Watching it now makes me realize just how badly one-off plays are treated nowadays  at best we have one-off cop thrillers with ex-soap stars but mostly the drive for ratings has seen 'ordinary' material been dropped in favour of stuff that can be made to look exciting and grabbing. Watching Rosenthal's work this week has been complimented by me digging out my Talking Heads collection and it has highlighted the lack of this type of stuff on the air but in fairness I suppose the BBC schedules are now too busy with Changing Rooms type shows to fit plays in!", "The title of this film comes from a line of dialogue spoken by Lipman in the film Eskimo Day, to which this is a sequel. I really liked Eskimo Day because it was more about the characters than anything else, with the dialogue revealing a great deal yet also blending in with normal conversation. The main, most obvious change here is that this film has much more structure to it and much more of a traditional plot that is spread over many months and not just one day. In a way this works better as it then gives it a stronger narrative but the downside is that the writing loses the strong insight that it had back in Eskimo Day  we already know the characters so the focus is not writing of the same style. However, with the characters from the first film, Rosenthal still delivers a good film that wanders at times but has other great moments. The average stuff is some comic stuff early on, subplots with the Lloyds that stutter along and the university stuff that comes in and out. However most of it still manages to engage and it does have some very good moments  Bevis' foreign and inexplicable (to him) feeling of emptiness producing some of the strongest bits.", "Reflecting this, David Ross dominates the film when he is on screen, although Lipman more than rises to the challenge of their empty nest/empty lives subplot. Wilkinson is not as well used this time and I wasn't totally won over by Carteret's thread even if she played it well. Howard and Sandiford are given more to do this time but their 'in love/out of love' thread is not as good as Rosenthal should have made it. Happily the cast work well (if not as well originally) and the material is still good enough to keep the interest.", "Overall it is a different film from Eskimo Day and in a way that is not all a good thing. The writing is much more about narrative than dialogue and it took me a while to settle into this idea. Despite this change, the film still does well enough to work as an one-off drama and, while bits of it are quite ordinary, some of it is great work from Rosenthal. And, if the plot makes too many jumps, I can forgive it because it still serves as a good conclusion to a story I enjoyed from the original film through to the end of this one."]},

Arnaz and his orchestra perform several Mexican/Spanish numbers including the catchy \"Guadalajara\" and \"Babalu\". Singer Amanda Lee joins him and sings on \"Easy Street\" while Searles and Galian appear towards the end of the film. Arnaz, with his band that he brought together during WWII, then kick back with \"Tabu\", \"Pin Marin\" and \"Tabu\". I think it goes without saying but fans of Arnaz are certainly going to want to check this thing out even if the famous guy is out-shined in his own film. I think the best number of the picture is \"Easy Street\" with Lee really hitting it out of the park and she's quite easy on the eyes as well. I found the number to be the best written and performed and the little skit that went with it wasn't too bad either. The rest of the numbers are decent but I think it's fair to say that Arnaz had much better material that would come about in a few more years."]},

Not only that, but he has also taken several hostages--with one of them being Sheriff Maratos' wife \"Dr. Sheri Maratos\" (Shannon Sturges). Now, rather than reveal any more, I will just say that this was a rather tame action film that suffered from its made-for-television format and the lack of any real suspense.

The reverse theme of bad kids turning good was fascinating, and the paranoid performance by Nick Stahl was worth watching and intrigued me. But then, as soon as Stahl was converted, the film started to fall apart. For one Stahl was the only character I found to be truly worth watching. Marsden and Holmes were just two pretty faces noticeably void of much talent; I never believed the two as a couple, and I never found any reason to invest myself in hoping for their well-being other the fact they were the lesser of two evils. But most noticeably, I grew disinterested because of the change in aim by the makers. The first half of the film, which by itself I would have given an 8 or 9 out of 10, was more of a grown-up horror movie, where the situation and plot rather than actions dictated the fear of the audience. But after Stahl disappears to the dark side, the film changed into a teen slasher film almost, where blood, violence and screaming is used in a vain attempt to induce fright. This 2nd half was worth a 4 or 5 out of 10. The length did not bother me as much as others (I've seen plenty of effective movies that were under 90 minutes). What bothered me more was the lack of development in some key plot points. I think the entire conspiracy plot behind the conversion of the teens needed to be fleshed out much more, characters needed to be drawn more distinctly, and so on.

Well, I say 'plot', this film doesn't really have any - a young lass sees an advert for a job, she goes for it - and then basically ends up having rough sex with a bunch of sleazy men. Director Shaun Costello is best known to me for his shocking 1972 film 'Forced Entry'. That film worked because it was completely relentless with its sleaze and savagery, whereas this one feels a bit flat. The 65 minute running time doesn't do it any favours in this department either, as it makes the film feel like it was put together as an afterthought...and it probably was. The sex scenes themselves aren't terrible. I'm not into 'domination' and S&M, but surprisingly (given the title), this film doesn't seem to be either.

They could have turned it off or walked out any time.", "First off, for those nay-sayers already posting reviews here on IMDb, the initial concentration of Tennessee-based reviews isn't reflective of filmmakers stacking the deck -- this film has been without a distributor and has only been seen at film fests and regionally, like, in Tennessee. I've seen it thanks initially to a friend who was born down south and now lives up here in the Godless north, and since worked to book it at a local film festival here in VT back in the spring.", "EXISTO exist-os in two versions: Coke Sams's original cut, which opens with Gailard Sartain's hilarious song \"Do Me,\" and a later (2004?) film festival slight re-edit with a whole new beginning, which provides a succinct backstory for Existo as a character and political context for the film proper, stating it as a W. Bush-era satire, though the film itself (shot in '98) predates Bush's presidency. Thus, it's pretty clear Sams, Bruce Arnston (a musical genius and satirist extraordinaire) and crew could clearly see where this country was headed before the '90s were out, and EXISTO is as timely as ever -- hence, its production was prescient more than reactionary in terms of its dystopian theocracy setting. How times change: America has become Nashville.", "The Nashville-based talent was indeed behind the entire ERNEST phenomenon, and in fact Existo (Arnston) was a fixture on the old Coke Sams/John Cherry produced/directed HEY VERN, IT'S ERNEST! TV series, in a less activist fetal form -- a maladroit stage illusionist, Existo the Magician (note Jackie Welch, terrific here as Maxine, was also a regular on the show, as were Sartain and others). Arnston also contributed clever musical spots to that program, as he did for at least one of the ERNEST films, and he and Welch worked again with Sams after EXISTO touring with a country-western musical comedy duo Bill & Coo, which hopefully will reach fruition in a form more folks can see.", "The semi-claustrophobic nature of the film is due to its being set in the underground nightclub scene Existo and Maxine return to in the opening. It's essentially a theater film, and that primary-set aspect (which again seems to be fueling some reviewers here) is apropos; as in films as diverse as THE BLUE ANGEL, CABARET, CAFE FLESH and TOPSY-TURVY, the core set IS the stage Existo performs on. Thus, apart from some key set pieces (in the posh renovated restaurant supplanting a former underground performance space, the estate Existo and Penelope retreat to, and some exteriors), it all centers around the club, a conceit some obviously chafe at though it's not reflective of low-budget paucity of imagination, it's integral to the concept and characters itself. If that's a negative for you, too bad. Theater films are, by their nature, often prescribed in their settings; this is not per se indicative of cheapness.", "Having spent time working theater in my college years, I can attest to the accuracy with which the film captures that insular universe, which is part of its appeal -- clearly, the filmmakers are also extrapolating from their own close-knit theatrical/video troupe. Again, despite the strong negative reviews here, there is a fine story at work -- the plot kicks in after the setup of the characters and world they live in. Every musical number (and this is a musical, as much as ROCKY HORROR, THE WICKER MAN, FORBIDDEN ZONE, etc.) is brilliantly executed, advancing characters and narrative with deft skill while being in and of themselves outstanding: brilliant, audacious, hilarious, akin to Trey Parker's abilities (though Arnston is, to my ear, by far the better musician and sharper talent; I've since snapped up the CD and love spinning it while working). To my mind, Arnston is an unsung musical genius, his entire body of work embracing (with seeming effortlessness) all idioms, genres and target audiences at one time or another, his wit quick and range astonishing. He's at the center of EXISTO, and it's his film.", "Seen today, EXISTO is still a pointed, funny and pretty savage snapshot of the \"Land of the Free\" since the Reagan Administration, \"Contract With (read:On) America\" anti-NEA ReBiblican era of politics kicked into full swing. Though the film's antic flamboyance deliberately undercuts any sense of mortal danger, Existo and his band of guerrilla performance artists are fighting for their lives against crushing political repression, making the film a curious companion to V FOR VENDETTA; in fact, in some ways EXISTO is closer to aspects of the original Alan Moore/David Lloyd graphic novel (created in the 1980s, reflecting Moore & Lloyd's anxiety over Thatcher's reign), retaining and expanding the music hall/cabaret element of the original V that the film adaptation ditched. Existo and his cronies, though, are less lethal compatriots, aiming to blow minds instead of Parliament.", "The venom leveled against this film by some of the IMDb reviewers is indicative of the reactions EXISTO elicits: viewers either love it or hate it. I've seen this at every showing; like a Guy Maddin film or offbeat musical oddities like FORBIDDEN ZONE or CANNIBAL! THE MUSICAL, EXISTO brooks no safe middle ground. Walkouts happen, but those who are caught in the film's glow find it intoxicating, and are cheering by the finale. Those of us who love it want to see EXISTO reach a much wider audience, and it hasn't lost its bite over the years. If anything, the teeth sink deeper, as the reality of US politics and society are closer to the fictional future EXISTO posited over seven years ago.", "The impatience of some viewers to any non-traditional form of cinematic satire shouldn't keep those receptive to this gem away. Give it a shot -- it's a great film!"]},

The resourceful Gólíat succeeds in locating Zero's hiding place, where he overhears part of Zero's newest plan. Although unable to get all the details, Gólíat reports to the station and it becomes clear that stopping Zero will be quite a challenge. The Captain is determined to ensure peace and the safety of the town for good. Thus the race against time begins. The clues lead to the pristine Round Forest, which is outside of their jurisdiction. The Captain goes undercover to find out just what Zero has in mind. He settles down on an island and makes friends with adorable little Dorka, the grandchild of the forest's president. The serenity of their home is in jeopardy, however, as Zero is scheming to sell the entire forest for profit. This move would not only render all residents homeless, but would also endanger the survival of the forest itself. When the Captain finds that Zero has arrived in the forest, he hurries away to get help. Thus Zero is left unattended, giving him an opportunity to move forward with his plans. Will the Captain and his trusted companions arrive back in time to save the Round Forest and its residents? This exciting animation is a delightful story for viewers of all ages. The sincere dedication and considerate approach of the Captain to accomplish his duty earns him much respect along the way.

He insults and is gratuitously nasty to any and all potential customers who merely ask to book a room. Key incidence of this bad (but quite amusing) behavior is when newlywed couple Derek Lane and Racquel Darrian (that porn team who would later get married in real life) are summarily turned down for a room on their wedding night. We've just seen Rick begrudgingly give out keys to the last two available rooms, so he's correct when he tells them no vacancies, but it's the way that he turns them down that's funny.", "In the briefest of cameo roles, Sharon Kane pops up to hand in her key as a sudden check-out, so Rick tells the couple they can have the room, but at $150 for the night. That doesn't sound like so much nowadays of course, but would be about $350 now, exorbitant considering Rick was running a fleabag of a hotel. So Derek turns him down even though the couple has little chance of finding a room elsewhere.", "Joey, who's booked one of the two final vacancies before Kane's became available, offers $150 to Derek if he'll let him watch the bride and groom have sex, promising he'll only watch and masturbate. Derek jumps at the chance, but Racquel balks, ultimately conceding. Of course we get to see (along with Joey) the hot couple go at it, in the manager's office on a sofa, as Joey lies and tells them that's okay. After Derek's cum shot (in the air, as Racquel finishes him off with a hand-job), Joey gets very angry and storms off, claiming they have broken tradition, namely \"pulling out\" on their wedding night rather than conventionally consummating the marriage!", "Star of the movie Samantha Strong has a solid sex scene with Joey that's inserted into the show very clumsily, taking place in a hot-tub outdoors -possibly a flashback but unrelated to the movie's setting inside a hotel. Samantha follows up by giving Savage a blow job (which he comically resists, staying in character as uppity and stubborn beyond belief).", "Later, she's anxious to have sex with husband Joey but he informs her he's phoned for a prostitute instead, and Kelly Royce shows up as a tough-talking hooker who not accidentally is styled and dressed very much like wife Strong.", "Resulting sex scene has Royce having sex with Silvera first, but soon Samantha joins in and the gals reject continuing on with Joey. Ultimately Royce rejects Joey and would rather masturbate. Savage catches her beating off and kicks her out of the hotel, ending the movie with his angry insistence: \"No more hooking in my hotel!\".", "One mystery I couldn't solve satisfactorily about this oddball movie concerns Alexandria Quinn. She's listed in many sources (including IMDb) in the cast but doesn't show up in extant copies of \"Heartthrob\", likely because she was edited out of her 1990 porn movies when a year later it was discovered she made them illegally at age 17. That would explain the movie's short (68 minutes) surviving running time."]},

Not only did it highlight some smaller forms of the war crimes of the Japanese army during World War II, but it was an obviously political piece meant to attack the Japanese government for, what Kobayashi saw as, injustices against minor war criminals when more guilty ones were let off with lighter sentences. He dramatizes it well, the movie ending extraordinarily well, but a lot of details about the situation that seem necessary to understand what's going on get left out (I had to look up what Class-A, B, and C war criminals were, for instance, despite the film mentioning them repeatedly), probably because 1953 Japan was marinating in the details, and he was making the film for a 1953 Japanese audience.", "One thing should be known about Kobayashi. He was a pacificist who rejected the militarism of 1930s Japan and, when he was conscripted into the Japanese army, he refused every promotion, remaining a private and was captured as a prisoner of war near the end, serving a year in a prison camp on Okinawa. He was not a man out to excuse Japanese crimes in Manchuria, which he witnessed with his own eyes. He was a man with sympathy for the lowest rung of the Japanese military and society that had been unjustly treated by their superior officers and government.", "The film is about a handful of war criminals in an American controlled prison in Tokyo as they wait until either their sentence is over or, for most of them, Japan becomes independent again and can determine what it wants to do with its prisoners without American input. All of these prisoners are B and C-Class war criminals, and what's interesting is that they are all guilty. Not just in the minds of the law, but we see flashbacks to their individual crimes. Yes, they did the deeds. Yamashita (Torahiko Hamada) was ordered by his superior officer Hamada (Eitaro Ozawa) to kill a native who housed them because he might have been part of a guerilla movement. Yamashita killed the native. Yokota (Ko Mishima) was an English translator at a POW camp that housed American soldiers, and he was ordered by his superior officer to whip a prisoner who had stolen some rice. The soldier died of his wounds from the whipping. These are guilty men, but the superior officers have gotten off with lighter sentences, most particularly Hamada who was released from prison before Yamashita and has returned to their hometown to undermine Yamashita's mother and sister.", "The topical nature of the film dominates for a while, and it becomes about the details of the handover of the prison from formal American control to de jure Japanese control but remaining de facto American control all while the Japanese constitution included an article disallowing the Japanese government from freeing the war criminals. This detail is here not for the story but because Kobayashi was making a contemporary political point and trying to influence his audience's outlook on the treatment of the war criminals still under arrest in their own country.", "The final half of the film concentrates on Yamashita's problem. Yokota has a brother out of prison who works for a leftist newspaper. After getting him to track down the innocent young girl he had known during the war (who has since become a prostitute, another attack on nostalgia from Kobayashi), he tells Yamashita's story to his brother who then publishes it in the newspaper. This causes a row within the prison. The Class-A prisoners (sitting on a stage above all of the Class-B and C prisoners) demand that the one who wrote the story give himself up, but no one will give up Yokota. At the news of Yamashita's mother's sudden death, the prisoners gather together to convince the authorities to give him one day to go back home to mourn before returning (he's followed by an official, so it makes this believable enough within the context of the film, meaning that I have no idea if they actually allowed this sort of thing). He's already tried to escape once, but the public opinion in his favor brought on by article seems to have enough influence over the authorities to allow him out for this one day of mourning.", "Of course, he tried to escape because he wants to kill Hamada. Hamada, who ordered him to kill the native and then testified against Yamashita in court, is living well on the outside while Yamashita sits in prison. The emotional reality of Yamashita finding Hamada and suddenly feeling no need to kill him, especially how Kobayashi lays out the scene with wonderfully dark shadows in the middle of the night, was what pushed me from appreciation to real affection for the film. There's real drama here about men who did bad things but are definitely being treated unjustly in comparison to others, and I feel for Yamashita.", "Kobayashi obviously chose to highlight stories (taken from real prisoners, it seems) that stack the deck in his favor. These are good men who were ordered by superior officers to do terrible things. He chose to not highlight any B or C-Class criminals who willingly or joyfully committed atrocities, and I think that undermines his contemporary political point. It's really the political angle that holds me back slightly, but the human stuff he does bring to the fore through his characters ends up so strong that I forgive a lot of it.", "It's the work of a young filmmaker, which makes the release date of the film interesting because, by watching his films in release order, we see him regress technically (while Fountainhead is a lesser film, it's more polished). At the same time, there's some wonderful visual stuff on display as well. There's a minor character who ends up in a nightmare where bullet holes start forming in his cell, and peeking through he sees the crimes he committed, driving him to suicide. It's not only gorgeous to look at but there's real sadness at the emotional reality of the man driven to take his own life in the face of his sins. Kobayashi brought everything he could to this, and really the main thing holding him back at all was that he was trying to be topical. Otherwise, he made a passionate film about men he obviously cared for."]},

The latter one is with a young June Allyson, who's just in her 8th short since beginning her film career the year before. Le Roy had a rather unusual dance style and was very adept at fast tap dancing rotating his feet back and forth behind one another.

In addition to her husband there is also her mother-in-law Shige (Kumeko Urabe), her sister-in-law Yasuko (Hideko Takamine) who was left partially lame in one leg in a bombing raid during the war, and her brother-in-law Noboru (Akira Ishihama) who is a student at the university and doesn't offer much to the store's running. There are small household conflicts between Hiroko and, in particular, Shige, mostly about what chores she should be doing. There is also some tension because she is still learning the household ways as well as how to effectively run the store, especially in a moment where she spills some soy sauce right after we've learned how little Ryoichi earns from a large bottle.", "The problems aren't her own. Yasuko, in particular, gets a good amount of attention due to her disability and singlehood. She describes herself as an old maid at 28-years-old, and she outright refuses to even meet with a potentially eligible man set up by her mother because he has three fingers missing, the idea being that she won't accept the charity or the pity of needing to be paired with another person maimed by the war. She doesn't know how she wants to fill her time, lying about going to flower arrangement classes and instead going to bicycle races, while giving up her music. She's in a funk.", "There is also the presence of a pair of men from hometowns far away. The first is Shinkichi (Ryohei Uchida), a childhood friend of Hiroko's who has come to Tokyo with his sister to try and find work. He tracks down Hiroko and obviously loves her despite the fact that she married another man. They meet a couple of times innocently but suspiciously enough (she goes away from the store when she's supposed to be watching it) that it causes gossip within the house. When he decides to give up on finding work in the city and return home, Hiroko joins him to the train station, and Ryoichi chases after them. Everything ends up innocently enough, though. Hiroko was never going to leave Ryoichi with Shinkichi. I think there was supposed to be a bit of tension around it, but she's too good to leave. At the same time, he's too good to actually take anything out on her. She may be messing up at work, having secret meetings with a former boyfriend, and costing him money when he smooths over any potential doubt by offering a gift of whiskey to Shinkichi, but he'll never take his anger out on her. In one way, Ryoichi is the rock on which the family operates. In another way, he's so trusting that he eliminates some dramatic tension.", "Ryoichi is a source of dramatic deflation in another sense as well. We get a lot of talk early about how hard it is for him to make ends meet in the deflationary Japan of the post-war period, especially when he also has to pay all of his taxes, but he seems to have an endless source of money. He gives allowances to both Noboru and Yasuko. He has five thousand yen socked away that he can instantly give Yasuko when she asks for it for a friend whose son is suffering from appendicitis. This ability to find money without any kind of effect on him is another deflationary bit.", "Ryoichi really is the dramatic deadweight of the film, but he's not the emotional center. That would be Hiroko. That separation is, I think, what makes the film work where it does. The plot mechanics of Ryoichi finding money is less important that Hiroko finding her place in this family. Her husband's support is necessary so that she can stay there, despite the conflicts that arise. And that journey is really quite nice.", "The point of the title comes from a conversation between Noboru and a school friend about how, somewhere out there in the wide world of Tokyo and Japan, there has to be someone for everyone. Ryoichi is Hiroko's somebody, and even Yasuko can find someone. The other friend from back home is Shun-don (Minoru Oki), an old-time flame of Yasuko's from the remote village that the family started from who let things go when Yasuko gained a fiancé during the war. The fiancé was killed in the war, and Yasuko was left lame. We've already seen her intransigence regarding pity husbands, and yet she ends up with real emotion for Shun-don. When he shows up and goes back because she refuses to meet with him, she's soon chasing after him, looking for her own connection.", "It's nice. It's not challenging, and it often feels like it's going to go darker than it does, but Kobayashi was still seemingly smarting from the poor reaction to The Thick-Walled Room from Japanese officials. He was making safe fare to keep working, relying heavily on his mentors and friends for stylistic and narrative directions. Still, the emotional throughline of Hiroko in the main and Yasuko in a secondary way is often quite strong. It ultimately just comes to a nice place, with people finding happiness where they can without the sharper edge of Kobayashi's later, more famous work, but as an example of a mid-50s Japanese family drama, it's a nice little entertainment."]},

The film focuses on a love triangle: the straight-laced bookseller Nishida and Yakuza gangbanger Joe compete for the affections of the bourgeois local girl Shizuko. The American military base looms large in the film but the action takes place outside of it, mostly in a nearby shantytown. Although he regards the American presence as pernicious, Kobayashi is clear as to where responsibility rests for immoral behaviour and deficiencies in character, namely, the individual and society as a whole.", "Kobayashi challenges preconceived notions as to whether people of a certain class are virtuous or vicious. Appearances may reinforce the moral decay of a character, such as the rotten teeth of the unscrupulous landlord, or conceal it in the case of the beautiful and virginal Shizuko. In a disturbing scene, not one tenant is willing to donate blood to a man who is critically ill--not even his own wife. Nishida at least deigns to admit that, in spite of having the correct blood type, he does not want to donate his blood. He may feel that the man, apparently less educated and of a lower class than him, is unworthy of his blood. However, his refusal is as callous and cowardly as that of the other tenants, exposing his apparent nobility as a mere façade.", "Black River exhibits the characteristic influence of film noir whose origin is American popular culture. Just as the presence of the American military corrupts Japanese society in the film, American culture has, as it were, corrupted Black River. Kobayashi paints in black and white a quasi-dystopian picture of a society that, having abandoned its principles, has descended into paranoia and mutual sabotage. The stylized and disinterested depictions of characters betray a moral ambivalence to their actions. Sultry jazz music, a distinctly American genre, provides the score of the film. Like the cinematography, its expression suggests that sordid deeds, places, and people are at hand.", "In general, Kobayashi juggles the large cast of characters skillfully. However, their number can distract from the film's main plot about the love triangle, leading to a loss of focus and making it difficult to identify with any one character. Humour often shines through the dark subject matter, notably in a quarrel about emptying outhouses and the use of communal space. Like most film noir, Black River occasionally wavers into campiness and mannerism.", "Kobayashi crafts a powerful ending to commit the metaphorical assassination of Shizuko's character. Once again, the Americans act as an accomplice but crucially not as the malefactor, the person ultimately responsible. Perhaps for the first time in the film, a character reflects on her own behaviour and is profoundly disgusted. Contemporary viewers will likely, as I did, have more sympathy for some characters and forgive them in light of the ordeals they have experienced or the circumstances in which they live. Nonetheless, Kobayashi makes a powerful argument, not to mention an excellent film that will appeal to fans of post-war cinema, film noir, and Japanese culture."]},

While that video broke new ground with its unprecedented sex and violence (specifically the full frontal nudity of the lead singer!), this is like any sequel: More of the same (well, almost, this time another girl goes full frontal), but bigger and bolder. So instead of nine minutes, this is almost twice as long, has longer dialogue scenes in the beginning and the end and features higher production values. This video looks like it took the budget of what most french art-house movies used at around the time. The results are undeniably impressive: The battle scenes at the end are fabulously staged, rather graphic and look like straight out of a feature film. The song itself, like its predecessor, is somewhat of a scandal to conservative ears, it's basically an ode to butt cheeks with the implied notion of eroticism revolving around them, either through caning (like in the video) or anal sex, as implied in the video as well. As usual, Farmer does bare her behind, too. But don't let the R-rated sex and violence scare you off, this is the most persuasive argument for music video as an art form, not merely a ploy to sell product. Like all her collaborations with Boutonnat until 1990, including \"Tristana\" and \"Désenchantée\", this is highly recommended for the way it promoted what music videos could do."]},

Because he can't act the whole premise of the feature falls apart -he's not tough enough, merely browbeating the girls on the need to get him a ton of money by his latest deadline, as he's in deep with mobsters who don't take no or be patient for an answer. His big line has dated quite a bit: \"I could make more money as a TV repairman\". That reminds us of one of the staples of stag movie subjects, now gone with the wind. Maybe future porn loops will involve the Best Buy Geek Squad making house calls??", "Painfully under-lit in its attempt at gritty location photography at night, the video is merely a series of sex scenes as the young whores do their thing. Even the boring HBO documentaries on the subject are more scintillating and certainly far more insightful than this weak-kneed effort.", "Besides Canyon, Gina Valentino and the relatively unknown Jade Nichols also get their licks in as prosties, earning about $20 to $40 a pop. Best part of the video for me was a tour of the streets displaying movie marquees listing vintage titles, like The Cave playing a Roberta Findlay double-bill: SWEET PUNKIN' and ANYONE BUT MY HUSBAND; the Circus Cinema showing TABOO and hyping Dorothy LeMay \"fresh from her smash hit '10': (the Blake Edwards movie was certainly a hit, but Dorothy was merely an extra alongside other porno chic greats like Serena and Annette Haven); the Burlesk showing LONG JEAN SILVER and the classic PANDORA'S MIRROR at the Pussycat Theater. Ultimately, it's time capsule documentation like that which gives a modicum of value to these throwaway porn videos."]},

The sets, story, style have the same feel and the rapist man/monkey monster has a small part. A mad doctor is using a super-strong robot to kidnap various people (probably politcians or rich industrialists, as usual). Somehow a female wrestler and her cop boyfriend finds out about the doctors diabolic plans and runs to the rescue. The robot itself is just a big Mexican with silver color sprayed on his face. His whole act concists of walking through cardboard walls and sink people with one fatal blow. I lost track of how many cardboard doors and walls he must have walked through during the film's brief 90 minutes, but it must have exceeded 20+. Although I loved the robot and the wrestling, amongst other things, the movie has far too much dialouge for its own good, making it pretty dull for non-Spanish talking people like me. Thus, I cannot really recommend this film to others than Hispanic viewers or fans of Mexican wrestling."]},

Some times she looks out her window as he looks out his, and they smile shyly at each other. She is dying of a lung disease, goes the local gossip. He is studying hard to get good enough grades to go to college. His father promises him whatever he wants if he passes. Ishihama wants to send her to a sanitarium, but his father is doubtful. He worries his son is being played for a sucker, but agrees: if he passes, he'll pay.", "Masaki Kobayashi's second movie as a director has a script by his friend Keisuke Kinoshita, but his handling is far from Kinoshita's. The problem lies not in the people, all of whom are well meaning and kind -- Yasushi Nagata as Miss Nozoe's evil uncle aside; his appearance at her building causes her to rush in terror into the snowy Christmas landscape and collapse in front of a Christian Church. The problem is G*d's intentions, as indicated by the opposing strains of two of Bach's pieces: \"Air on the G String\", a piece which celebrates G*d's love, and \"Toccata & Fugue in D Minor\", a piece which celebrates the mystery and anger of the Lord. Surely the fact that Ishihama's family is Christian makes this a significant choice for Chûji Kinoshita, who scored the movie. It's not the evil and self-serving power structure who threaten Miss Nozoe, and whom Ishihama must struggle against. It's G*d and textbooks. Or perhaps this is simply His goad to force Ishihama to study for His purposes.", "Clearly Kobayashi's associates wanted this movie to succeed; that's probably why his cousin, Kinuyo Tanaka, took a supporting role. With its familiar themes of young, unrequited love, it's a little soppy for my taste, and the symbolism is laid on heavily, but it's very well done."]},

(Note: The object of everyone's attention is supposed to be THE Brooke Shields, not Blair Castle, the porn performer who took to using the nom de porn \"Brooke Fields\". I've seen several reviews of this movie in which the reviewer doesn't seem to realize that. No one is going to be planning on vacationing on the French Riviera for years by their son marrying & joining the assets of a porn performer, But an actress & model of Brooke Shields' fame circa 1984? Absolutely! Furthermore, this film is a sequel of sorts to \"Brooke Does College\", and indeed a reference is even made to it, in which Blair Castle also appears as Brooke Shields. Maybe this was even meant to be a trilogy, given its non-ending. It certainly seemed to leave the door open for a continuation of the story. However, Blair Castle's porn career was winding down and would end altogether following an infamous occurrence while filming a scene with Jamie Gillis this same year.)\nOkay, enough about Blair Castle, back to the real star of this movie, Chelsea Blake. She advises her son Mark to inform her on how he plans to consummate his marriage to Brooke & she'll lend whatever assistance is necessary. After he departs, she begins to masturbate loudly & hungrily, demonstrating both her sexual frustration & her forbidden lust for her son and we the audience now know what's coming and can spend the next 20 minutes or so anticipating it.\nAnd when it finally happens, oh boy! Mark returns to his mother's bedroom, crestfallen at having been rejected by Brooke, interrupting her as she's about to masturbate once again, and they satisfy each other in a scene that would arouse a dead man, complete with dirty talking, two separate \"money shots\", Chelsea calling Mark her \"little boy\" numerous times, and a coupling that's equal parts anger & lust. 10 star rating for this scene alone. It's that good.\nOh, yeah. Vanessa Del Rio is in this, as is Colleen Brennan, and Danielle, who does a nice Jacuzzi lesbian scene with Brooke which would have been reason enough to see this movie, but the above mentioned Chelsea Blake's work here is all the reason you need."]},

His early efforts may be a little dull and lack his later societal angst, but they are not badly made films. He was a pro. But \"Mittsu no ai\" fails flat in everything it tries. The general idea is to depict a small rural community in the post-war years, and through the local characters, paint a portrait of three different kinds of love. This already is an arguable failing, since I counted five different kinds of love: love between mother and a child, love between man and woman, love between friends, love of God, and love of animals. Love of art could be the sixth, and I'm sure you could find more.", "The film does not have one narrative, but instead introduces various characters and tells their stories. If there is one central character, that would be Heita, a mentally challenged boy, who loves running in the hills, and has an obsession about birds. The element of the film that gets most time is Heita's running, his birds, his friendship with another boy Ikujiro, and his weird relationship with a Christian priest (Ito Yunosuke). The priest struggles with his love of God, and also the love for his ex-wife. Yunosuke misses his mother, from whom he gets separated in the very beginning. There is also a poor painter, who is in love with the beautiful teacher, played by Kishi Keiko, and some other characters too, like the mother played by Yamada Isuzu.", "The narrative threads do not really form a neat tapestry here, and they aren't that interesting either. To make his film comprehensible in at least some way, Kobayashi has added narration to the beginning and to the end. This frames the film as a Christian tale of moral, though the depiction of Christianity in this film is loose and thoroughly weird. Especially the religious portrayal of Heita's insanity is not well thought out.", "I love Kobayashi's films, and I am also very fond of Shimizu Hiroshi's childhood depictions and Kinoshita Keisuke's young romances, both of which this film emulates. But \"Three Loves\" is chaotic from start to finish. The film lacks meaning or substance, and though it tries to depict different kinds of love, it does not have anything new to say about them. Two hours becomes a long time to spend running on the hills with Christians chasing birds."]},

Kobayashi, a man haunted by his experience of WWII, was not the right guy to make films like this, but had initially problems of getting his darker narratives off the ground, with the studio being as it was.", "\"Musuko no seishun\" (Youth of the Son, 1952) is Kobayashi's debut. Only 45 minutes in length - he would come to be known for extremely long films - you would never guess who made it. The film is a warm depiction of a post-war Japanese family with two sons approaching adulthood and enjoying their youth. \"Youth\" in this film's view is a simplistic concept, which mostly includes dating girls and fighting with other boys, and thus getting into trouble.", "Though the film is very short indeed, the tone varies, but it's for the most part an enjoyable experience. The strangest aspect, considering again who Kobayashi would come to be as a filmmaker, is that this film includes a bunch of singing. Besides hearing \"Happy Birthday to You\" in English, the young people of this film are singing the theme song to John Ford's 1949 film \"She Wore a Yellow Ribbon\" in Japanese. This was a bit surreal, but certainly a memorable curiosity.", "The cinematography is better than in an average Shochiku debut of that era, some would argue that it's better than that of an average Shochiku film, even though the cinematographer Takamura Kuratoro was only at the beginning of his career. Acting feels slightly loose, because the narrative is not grounded, but the actors are very pleasant. Ishihama Akira would go on to play an important role in \"Harakiri\", and of the studio regulars, Miyake Kuniko, Kita Ryuji and Ryu Chishu contribute also to the charm of the whole.", "All in all, Kobayashi's filmography being much smaller in quantity than that of his contemporaries, with only 21 feature films, I understand that many of his fans will want to check this out. It's not up to his later standards, but it's also not his worst film, as his early filmography contains a few missteps like \"Mittsu no ai\" (Three Loves, 1954). \"Youth of the Son\" is interesting, because it's the debut of a famous director, though I would suspect that it would have been forgotten if this hadn't been the case."]},

Everyone lives alone with himself. The sooner you realize this, the better.\"", "This phrase should particularly ring a bell for 14 year old, visually impaired Marta Rezkova. Her doctor and instructor advises this realization so that she can stop being afraid to \"take the jump\" and make a better effort to orient herself anew in her environment after losing sight. Focus on sounds, snap fingers to identify the degree of echo, learn Braille, use a yoyo to estimate the depth in front. But Marta doesn't seem interested. Not only does is the prospect of staying in a special boarding school until she graduates high school at 18 frightening enough, but Marta also believes that her sickly condition is life-long.", "What exactly does she suffer from? It's not exactly blindness, because during her trip to the \"life- threatening third floor\", she tells a boy she sees \"wave shapes, certain colours and movements\", things she cannot understand and is unable to explain, i.e. a personal experience (or, as they were called in a different scene by someone else, \"a private cinema\" (resembling the concept of a \"prisoner's cinema\") with colours, lights and self- induced sensations) - phosphene. The film tries to visualize these through the occasional 'Vetigo'-like/Saul Bass-like on-screen visual effects and designs, that also nicely serve to quickly get to an entirely different scene, some of which are likely also part of Marta's imagination or memory. I was reminded of 'Vertigo' earlier though - right after the \"blackout\" and confusion there're the opening credits with mysterious music reminiscent of Bernard Herrmann's score. It nicely continues throughout the film to give a sense of anxiety.", "I don't think that it's a coincidence that repeated terms and motifs, such as \"nausea\" after the \"fall\" in the \"amusement park\", the aforementioned \"life-threatening\" third floor with no railings (the cliff before the abyss of death?), dizziness, sickness, loneliness, eclipse, losing grip of reality, losing sight or \"fear\" before the \"jump\", correspond to an amalgamation of existentialist ideas and book titles. Marta is mocked in both schools she attends – first she must draw a monster blindfolded, but the teacher writes \"self-portrait\" above for the amusement of the class, marginalising Marta – the source of fun and mockery. In her second school she is unable to perform at a gym class and runs away. Moreover, she thinks about suicide (\"such life is not worth living\"), which she could do if she \"let go\" from the floor without a railing before \"the abyss\" (of which she dreams too), and sees a psychologist (that uses her in his research, encourages her to chant \"Me! Me! Me! We're not afraid of anything\" and love herself, that in the end helps Marta persevere and make the right kind of jump: the life-embracing one, where she faces fear and lands on her feet).", "-\"How do you perceive fear?\" -\"Black. () I'm falling, dropping down very fast from a great height. It's all black. It's as if something slumped or tore off inside me.\"", "Hence 'Incomplete Eclipse' is a nice allegory for a (coming-of-age) existentialist condition. It's just pleasant to watch. Technically and pacing-wise I was reminded of 'The Cremator': a fast pace, with some \"illogical\" editing, a voice-over, subjective approach and recurring motifs associated with height, falling and perception (there is quite the 'Vertigo' connection). This is the second Jire film I've seen (the first was \"Valerie\", which is one of my favourite films), and with both he shows competence and preoccupation with interesting themes, though \"Eclipse\" is more straight-forward and less layered.", "7/10"]},

With his overbite and a hearing aid dangling from his right ear, the narrator informs us that Zensaku is just like any other middle-aged man in Tokyo and that he is not a tragic figure (he even questions why writers enjoy such characters at all). He leads a small patent office with two others, takes the train to and from work, and goes home to his nagging wife (Tomoko Naraoka) and two children Reiji (Toshio Kurosawa) and Sakiko (Wakako Sakai). Reiji is preparing for his entrance exams to university, but he has no drive or direction and is considering dropping the whole thing to the consternation of his father.", "One day, one of Zensaku's underlings at his office asks him if he knows a woman named Yosiko (Michiyo Aratama) whom he met working at a bar on the other side of the city. It takes him a moment to recognize the name of the girl he had loved before the war, the second part of a trio of friends broken up by the draft with the third being their friend Ohno (Kunie Tanaka) who died during the war. He rushes over to find her newly widowed with her deceased husband's plans for a new kind of heat-resistant plastic that she wants help figuring out what to do with it. Enlisting the help of a friend, Zensaku takes Yosiko to his friend's contact at a manufacturing plant Suzuki (Kei Sato). Suzuki and Zensaku, having not met since the war, share a past. Suzuki was Zensaku's superior officer in the war and beat Zensaku horribly when Zensaku refused to himself beat a starving American POW who had stolen rice. The beating left Zensaku completely deaf in his left ear and partially deaf in his right. To make matters more complicated, Reiji meets a girl at a studying institution who happens to be Suzuki's daughter, and they are falling in love.", "You can see the tight little world that gets created with Zensaku rediscovering Suzuki and Yosiko while his own son develops a relationship with Suzuki's daughter that seems a hallmark of a tightly constructed novel. These sorts of coincidences define how the action comes together, but that's where the coincidences end. The development and resolution of the action is all upon the characters themselves and their own choices, and that's where the film's intentionally quiet power comes from.", "Zensaku has grown to dislike his own wife, and here comes his old love, still beautiful in her middle-age, into his life, but her success and happiness is up for grabs. She knows of what Suzuki did to Zensaku, but Suzuki is also the one giving her a great deal for the rights to the patent along with a promise of a space in one of his buildings for her to have her own bar instead of working in someone else's. He's essentially trying to buy her as his mistress, and Zensaku has nothing to offer her but sentiment. The problem is, as is noted by several characters including himself throughout the film, is that he is a coward. He took great beatings throughout his life, but he never stood up for himself. And even now, with a potential for happiness within his grasp again, he's meek. There's a fantastic final showdown between Suzuki and Zensaku in Yosiko's bar where Suzuki stands firm in his belief that everything he did during the war was justified and that Zensaku deserved everything that he got. Zensaku can do nothing but slink away as Suzuki claims Yosiko.", "The mirror to Zensaku is Reiji, his son. Reiji, undirected and after an incident on the street where he tries to teach some manners to a line cutter awaiting a bus that goes badly for him, ends up visiting the National Defense Forces with the man who saved him from the incident. The order and clarity of the Japanese analogous entity to the armed forces appeals to him despite everyone else's resistance to the idea, in particular Zensaku's, stemming from his horrible time in the army during the War. Why Zensaku even entered service, though, is an interesting question that gets raised early, then ignored for about an hour, and then readdressed in the film's finale.", "Before his draft notice had come, he had made a plan with Yosiko to listen to the leaflets dropped by the American planes about what town was going to be bombed next and when. If he went there the day before, survived the bombing, and then switched identities with a dead man, he could avoid the draft. And yet, the next flashback after this plan gets explained shows him as a guard in the army leading to his beating. What happened? Well, it's key to his small kind of bravery. He wasn't legally allowed to conscientiously object to the war, and to refuse to show up would have meant prison. And yet, despite all of the other concerns of all of the other people, including, most particularly, Ohno, they all went. So, Zensaku decided that it wasn't fair to abandon his own place to shove someone else in. He didn't want to die, or to fight, but he went anyway after seeing the horrors of war firsthand in the bombing. That decision led him to his quiet, tired life. It's sad in his own small way.", "The wounds of the pass may heal, but the scars remain. Zensaku will forever be mostly deaf, but the times do change. Reiji is the future, and despite Zensaku's hatred of Suzuki, is it fair to hold that against his daughter? Is it fair to equate the Army of WWII with the National Defense Forces of the 60s? There are lessons to be learned, but you cannot live in the past. Zensaku makes his decision to stop living in the past, and it's a quiet, modest victory that may pale in the face of the promise of a new life with Yosiko. It's still a victory, though.", "This is an intelligent and elegant little film from Kobayashi. It's themes feel more mature in a way, stepping away from the endless fight against an unjust system and finding a way to lead one's life modestly and well (the stated goals of many of Kobayashi's protagonists through his angrier films, mind you). There's real tenderness when Zensaku returns home in the end, and it's well earned."]},

She is a pioneer of the Third Cinema, a treasure of New Latin American movies along with her husband Jorge Silva. One of my favourite artistic duo followed by Hélène Cattet-Bruno Forzani, Franciszka and Stefan Themerson, Werner Nekes & Dore O, Marie Clémence Andriamonta- Cesar Paes, Yervant Gianikian-Angela Ricci Lucchi, Arthur and Corinne Cantrill, Alan and Joan Root, Joseph Winter-Vanessa Winter, Straub-Huillet and Jimmy Chin & Elizabeth-Chai Vasarhelyi . I'd say Marta Rodriguéz, a student of Jean Rouch, is one of the best living filmmakers and an activist with Marxist anthro-documentaries as a form of political education. I don't want to go into the scathing critique approach that is present in almost all her works but want to state that she has a very unique vision that i get blown away by the filmmaking style. It's so hard to make something that visceral considering the Intimate portrait of indigenous people but also have it be compelling like a visual odyssey.", "In Our Voice of the Earth, Memory and the Future (Nuestra voz de tierra, memoria y futuro), this documentary records the struggle of Cauca Regional Indigenous Council (CRIC), an indigenous community in Columbia where the people fight to preserve their cultures and languages and reclaim their lands, which over time was lost to the advancement of civilization. It also captures the reality of Land owners treating the peasants very badly. The mindset of the people to reclaim land is not going the legal way or confronting the bishop which is like fighting half the government. They organise, calculate their plan on blackboards as the landowners strike a deal with the devil on top of mountains, highlands and make a wish. This sequence is so hypnotic with terrific score as devil appears in form of foreigners and smell of sulphur, who appear and vanish suddenly. There is so much more in the runtime that almost hides its multi-layered themes and subtextual meanings behind the trance inducing cinematography. Hope I own that diablo ring someday or shoot a sequence of the cow like the way it's shot in this documentary, so hypnotic and there is nothing to criticize in this gem, in my opinion. Let me remind that this is not a 'typical' documentary with all the traditional genre troupes, it will have divided opinions, for sure. Regardless, this is a work that is attention-demanding and becomes interesting as the minutes go by. I also recommend Chircales (1972) and Love, Women and Flowers (1988). There will be a small audience for Marta Rodríguez, i'm sure her works will spawn future women filmmakers imaginations and will create an impact on the next generation."]},

Not unlike every other professional environment then where people are sucked dry of imagination and creativity in order to generate more cash-flow. The film's feral tone tended to alienate a lot of established contemporary carnal critics, which may stand as the best possible evidence that its makers had succeeded in their set-up.", "Eddie, indelibly portrayed by the brilliant Jerry Butler who felt so strongly about the material, he chose the film's title for his gossipy autobiography, is a struggling actor making ends meet as a waiter until his friend and co-worker (an engaging performance from stalwart Joey Silvera) fills him in on a sweet, little sideline in the porno field. Coming along more out of curiosity rather than seriously considering a career in this line of work, Eddie has to step in for his malfunctioning buddy at a moment's notice with a busty blonde starlet (Rhonda Jo Petty leaning towards matronly), impressing the female director Carolyn (magnificent Lisa DeLeeuw, who tragically passed away from AIDS in 1993, once again proving her mettle as a sophisticated comedienne) who will become equal parts help and hindrance throughout his subsequent professional life. Landing a part on a popular daytime soap, Eddie soon learns that porn is a dirty secret that never goes away as Carolyn reveals the intimate footage she holds of him to the hypocritical, scandal-hungry masses. The love of a good woman, prostitute Nancy (Cassandra Leigh's career performance), might prove some sort of salvation but the movie's careful not to over-sentimentalize this aspect of the story, preferring to keep both feet firmly planted on the ground. Time and again, our \"hero\" finds himself drawn back into the sex for sale business, excelling at it against his own volition. This conclusion ranges RAW TALENT amongst other non-starry-eyed adult features like Chuck Vincent's ROOMMATES and Thomas Paine's CORPORATE ASSETS that have the guts to view the sex industry unromantically from the inside out, warts and all, yet thankfully without recourse to chest-beating Mea Culpa or the sickly sanctimonious approach the mainstream frequently adopts in covering same.", "And that's not all. It looks and sounds like a \"real\" film, so In addition to the vitriolic writing, the acting proves way better than anyone in his right mind will expect from what is after all \"just\" porno. Those already mentioned aside, plump Taija Rae (unforgettable Lisa Chinaski from Ron Sullivan's TABOO American STYLE) brings warmth to the part of the homely little office worker Eddie plays house with, a good thing he can't help but screw up by inviting Vietnam buddy Ron Jeremy into the house and bedroom. Rather unfortunately,both guys ultimately settle their differences in one of the more ludicrous martial arts displays ever to take place in front of a camera ! Underrated Tish Ambrose, a woman I always felt should have been the next Veronica Hart but whose initial promise – in Revene's own WANDA WHIPS WALL STREET among several prestigious projects – remained unfulfilled (perhaps due to well-publicized drinking problems), also scores highly as the soap actress who rallies to Eddie's defense in one of the film's funniest scenes topped by their freaky coupling, stylistically influenced by the Kelly Nichols/Ron Hudd psychedelic porker from ROOMMATES. Like the story, the sex is filled with hate and nastiness, people preying on each other with just the occasional – and frequently dashed – glimmer of hope through potential romance to set it off. Understandably, this is going to turn some viewers off, but the movie's makers should at least be congratulated for taking such an unpopular stance and following through on their convictions."]},

The mistake is viewing this as a direct sequel to \"Ringu\", made at the same time by a different director it of course does not have the same feel, or menace as its predecessor. Since most people will watch the original first the change in tone is hard to accept. A lot of people also declare this to detach itself too far from the original and explain too much of the mystery with science. When in fact the first two Ring novels have a firm root in science. I also found \"Ringu 2\" to be just as guilty at favouring science over the unknown, the difference being \"Rasen\" does explain things thoroughly. The major disappointment here is that I never really felt anything close to fear, or even uneasiness. However in terms of drama, and expanding on the first this film succeeds. The cinematography is just stunning, and the final scene is a scene I find just as disturbing as the ending of \"Ringu\", not in a fear inducing way, but in a contemplative sort of way. It is also a beautiful scene, and the whole film is well shot. Unlike \"Ringu\" the acting is a mixed bag, Koichi Sato just about holds up, but as the lead he seems to struggle with acting with emotion, which is a minus considering his character deals with suicide. Overall I think the film should be watched, as a side-note to \"Ringu\" but judged on its own merits, as it certainly surpasses many scientific thrillers around."]},

Illogical to the nth degree the film has Ken going traveling the world studying art and sciences, and the teachings of Bushido from masters placed around the globe. The 23-ish year old kid comes home from his worldly studies looking like a well worn 50 year old buck toothed stereotype Japanese from a propaganda cartoon complete with impossibly thick accent. Now back in the US, Ken, who now looks older than his adopted father, begins to set up a network of spies along the West Coast as well as preparing maps hidden inside of his modern art style paintings. Very much of the time this was made its now almost no longer watchable since sensibilities have changed so much in the last 60 plus years that this sort of treatment of an ethnic group is unthinkable (never mind that the film is only marginally okay). In the right frame of mind this would be a yuck fest of the highest order for those who love bad movies, however after a short time the general poorness of the film and the ugly point of view takes away a great deal of the fun.

Sadly, Scully's New Year's Eve isn't as widely available and is rarely repeated on TV or streaming services possibly partly due to music clearance.

At the end of Matteo Garrone's first feature «Terra di mezzo» I immediately ranked him among the third. I already knew about his talent since 2008 for «Gomorra», but I followed him and watched his old and new movies, and then in 2018 with the impressive «Dogma» there was no doubt.", "From the beginning he showed maturity and style that made him ipso facto an \"auteur\". Nanni Moretti awarded his first short «Silhouette», Garrone made «Self Service» with the prize money, and both shorts became parts one and three of this film about the migrant working class in Europe, in the lowest paid and most unworthy jobs.", "Perhaps the Bulgarian clairvoyant Baba Vanga foresaw the invasion of the northern hemisphere by people from the south (many of whom are, in fact, Muslims), which would bring about the fall of Europe. And she does not seem clueless. Those exploited peoples, whose original inhabitants were decimated, whose lands and resources were usurped, whose cultures were despised in the elaboration of an ethical code to live on Earth in harmony with nature, today perhaps --without realizing it-they are undermining the lands of the North and some kind of shock will come to pass, along with wars, natural disasters and climate change.", "In this \"land in between\" (apparently the Italian peninsula, bathed by the Mediterranean) converge the young Nigerian prostitutes of the first segment «Silhouette», the Albanian mason boys of the second segment «Euglen & Gertian», and the old Egyptian who attends a gas station in «Self Service». The three segments recount a day in the life of these people. Garrone threaded fictional elements around the protagonists and made the prostitutes, the bricklayers and the gas station attendant play themselves. It is a proposal that, if not new, is magnificently achieved, so that you feel that you are watching three portraits of the life of the migrant, but at the same time you follow the central characters in the same way as watching a drama, since the film's script is structured as such.", "The prostitutes are the most jovial and their case is not deepened more perhaps because we all know that prostitution is immemorial as time. The beautiful Afro-descendant women struggle with their clients, laugh, haggle, argue, fight, insult, but the morbid side of their profession is not shown in the tale, which is intrinsically violent. Beautiful feminine voices chant and accompany the working day of these women who fled from the misery of colonized Africa, only to fall into a not very encouraging panorama.", "The middle segment is the softest, with a group of young males who assume their migrant drama with youthful spirit, perhaps with greater hopes and, as men, taking advantage of the undeserved privileges that society gives us simply by putting an M on each time we are asked what our sex is. However, it shows us the contractors, most in frank ignorance of the condition of their \"workers\", some kind, others completely clueless.", "Finally, the segment of the old Egyptian Ahmed (called Amedeo in the \"land in between\") is the most moving: one, because the character is very charismatic; two, because he confronts the abuse of clients with a certain wisdom of an older adult; and three, because Garrone relies on fragments of some black and white footage of which no information is given, in which the younger Ahmed recounts his life.", "In the end, «Terra di mezzo» flows like life, and while Ahmed, at the end of his night shift, arrives at dawn in his humble room and prepares to sleep, the African prostitutes and the Albanian masons without work permits take their arms on the highway, waiting to be \"picked up\" to earn their livelihood."]},

It was directed by the well known Mexican horror director Carlos Enrique Taboada, which probably led to some misinterpretation when it came out. I would probably label this movie as an exceedingly captivating, charming and stylish adventure/family/dark-comedy with some mildly disturbing situations here and there. Other than that, I would never recommend this film to anyone who is in the mood for real horror. As a matter of fact, I think this movie is in reality suitable for all audiences, including children. The final scene is a little bit wicked, that's true, but the rest of the story is somehow childish and naive in a good way. Even though this film ended up being poles apart from what I was actually expecting, I must say that this film is charming and lovable in a way that I would have never imagined.", "\"Poison for the fairies\", is some kind of wicked fairy tale about two little girls who become friends, despite the fact that there entirely unlike. Flavia is the nice, innocent girl who doesn't know anyone at school and has no friends. On the other hand, Veronica is a weird and yet sweet-looking blonde schoolgirl who happens to be fixated with witches and all kinds of sinister things. This fascination for witchcraft and her peculiar manners, earn her a very bad reputation among the other girls. Regardless, Veronica doesn't seem to care and she even claims to be a witch herself!. At first, Flavia doesn't trust her friend's menacing side, but eventually, she becomes a victim of Veronica's delusional reality and constant charades, until she finally ends up believing what is clearly a lie. In \"Poison for the fairies\", we see this amusing friendship that connects these two little girls and their deplorable attempts for black magic. ", "I honestly didn't think I was going to be so fascinated by a movie that didn't promise anything at all, to begin with. \"Poison for the fairies\" is a movie that reminded me of some of some Italian horror films, due to its artistic virtues and antique settings. \"Poison for the fairies\" is a very naïve adventure/family/horror fairy tale that shows a magical and dark world seen by an untrained and hopeless little girl who sees an alternative reality. The circumstances that Flavia and Veronica undergo to during the course of this film, are adorably entertaining. I'll never understand why \"Poison for the fairies\" is actually measured as a horror film by some people. The only scenes that may have a little share of horror, are the ones in which the figure of a creepy witch appears very quickly. Also, the final minutes are a little bit too dark and dramatic for a movie that didn't prepare the audience for something like that and it was the only thing I didn't enjoy that much. Other than that, this film is highly enjoyable, calm and enchanting. Be prepared to enjoy a dark comedy for children, with a very unexpected and powerful ending."]},

Butler a WWI vet and war hero moved to Sunday Island some 14 years ago when he was wiped out in the stock market crash of 1929. This was for him to get away from the rat race, and Great Depression, back home to live out his life in the tranquil and quit South Pacific but his life is now to take an abrupt change. With the two flayers the American USN Lt.Allan Scott ,Edward Norris, and German Lt. Kurt Heinmann ,Henry Guttman,landing safely on the island they have to learn to live in peace with each other despite the war between their two's country's going on the other side of the world.", "Heinmann for his part is so ridicules in his Nazi beliefs that it's hard not to realize, by everyone on the island, that he's doing everything he possibly can to get in touch with his allies, the Japanese. This is to alert them about Sunday Islands huge oil reserve that are bubbling and oozing all over the place like the famous Old Faithful at Yellowstone Park; oil that the Japanese and Germans desperately need to sustain their war machines. Let. Scott meanwhile is so involved with Butler's pretty young daughter Nora,Inez Coopewr, that he completely forgets about the devious German flier Lt. Heinmann who's doing everything to contact the Japanese and get them to invade Sunday island.", "It later turns out that Heinmann has an ally on the island the charming and lovable, but German espionage agent, supply boat captain Pieter van Bronk, Robert Armstrong, who's been spying on Sunday Island for his Fatherland. Van Bronk has been reporting back to the Fatherland for almost ten years about Sunday Island being rich in oil and having an airstrip for German, or Japanese, aircraft to be used in case of a future war, that's now a reality, with America.", "The film gets more outrageous as it goes along with the island's chief Satini Pualoa's son Taro, John Roth, getting killed by Van Bronk who's later killed by the angry natives. The bumbling Henimann trying to kiss, or rape, Nora has Scott coming to her rescue and ends up being in one of the most laughable fights in move history with Henimann being taken away, after Scott knocked him out, and dumped into the Pacific Ocean by the natives. During this mindless spectacle The tied up Nora had to keep from watching it in order not to crack up.", "Butler who wanted together with his \"butler\" on the island Harry ,Ernie Adams,to remain neutral during the war finally sees the light and gets together with Scott and the natives to take on the Japanese army who land in the middle of the dense and impassable jungle on a jumbo cargo plane. Scott Butler and the natives make short work of the invaders with less then a dozen guns and a lot of spears and arrows; this against some 100 heavily armed and fanatical Japanese troop. ", "Just too much to take with too little, if nothing at all, to take seriously even for a Hollywood war propaganda movie at the height of WWII.

They like nothing better but to spend hours in the local beer-house, chucking down liters upon liters of beer (which they drink from buckets called \"Mas\"), playing cards of joking with their cronies. However, at the next moment that might fall into melancholic stupors, staring for hours into said mugs, contemplating whether it's half full or half empty and the meaning of life and death. Like I said: they often do blame that conditions on the weather, not the alcohol and usually they're only half-joking.", "\"Die Überführung\" (which is the process of bringing a dead body or coffin home to be buried) is one of those rare exceptions of a Bavarian movie, that is neither a light comedy nor a folk-film, but rather a drama that meanders on the dark side of the Bavarian psyche. It's a movie about the loss of innocents and, more important, the loss of time. In particular, the price of time that is often squandered at the taverns and beer-gardens, where the past is contemplated and celebrated, while the future is all too often not even considered at all. Director Kurt Wilhelm has picked up on this common Bavarian flaw, that for many the past is often way more important than the future. Visitors may have noticed, that Bavaria is one of the few German states where people still regularly their \"Tracht\" (the traditional Tirolian attire), where many hamlets still seem stuck in the 18th century and people still speak in reference to their king, who has died more than 150 years ago. Toni Berger and Karl Obermeyer were among the most popular Bavarian actors of their period and get the chance to for once play in a serious movie. Both are excellent as best friends, who are more like brothers and seem to compensate each other for the limbs they lost on the battleground. They are men who at all times have one foot on the bloodstained soil of Verdun, while planting the other firmly in the next tavern. The landscape virtually plays the third main-role. Bavarians are generally proud of the majestic beauty of the land, the semi-wild nature, mountains and deep forests. The dark side of this are (literally) the winters, where the air itself seems to freeze and the sun seems to shun the land. It is in one such winter that \"Die Überführung\" plays in. Most pictures seem devoid of light and warmth, apart when being inside a train-station-tavern or a beer-house, which is found on virtually every corner. There is an illusion of time standing still, but as Martl and Schexbräu will have to discover, it is only an illusion.", "Perhaps because of it's melancholic content, this is a very rare and very obscure Bavarian film to find, but will occasionally be shown on local TV, generally around the times of All Hollows Eve, which is in itself a time of contemplation. It still is very worthwhile for those, who wonder why and how nature and weather play such a big role in the films of Werner Herzog (himself being Bavarian). As a rarity it gets a 7 from 10."]},

Today, I'll be analyzing the 1984 television miniseries made by the BBC starring Roy Marsden (best known for playing Adam Dalgliesh in the Anglia Television adaptations of the P. D. James's detective novels) as the titular character.", "The 1984 version has 6 episodes overall, and each of them run for 25-30 minutes. It's clear that series director Gareth Davies wanted the adaptation to be more faithful than the 1939 one because it includes more scenes as presented from the novella, while adding some original scenes to enhance the story. One subplot that's omitted from both the 1939 and 1969 adaptations is the one in which Catherine convinces Mr. Chips and the headmaster to invite boys from the slums to play a game of soccer (oh sorry, football) against the Brookfield students. I have a feeling that this was added to show the impact that Catherine had on the school. The other noted scene is how Chips meets his love for the first time. I talk about how this went down in my review of the black-and-white version, so long story short: Chips is walking in the mountains in England, and he sees a woman waving and shouting, so he climbs up, intending to rescue her and proceeds to sprain his ankle. This is presented as such in the 1984 version. It took three adaptations of the story to display that crucial moment in its original form.", "As mentioned earlier, there are scenes not present in the book that are in the show. In the sixth and final episode, when the Great War is going on, a student reveals that he doesn't want to fight even though he has already enlisted. He claims that seeing his father's wounded body and talking to a battered soldier at the hospital convinced him that the war was not worth fighting for. Mr. Chips tries to persuade the boy that it's his duty to fight. The student refuses, so he gets arrested for being a deserter. I wouldn't be surprised that this scene was added since the show couldn't do the bombing sequence from novella due to its low budget. This sequence brings an anti-war message to the story, but I'm not sure if it's necessary. During the Great War section of the novella, Hilton makes it clear that it's best to carry on regardless of the present situation. Instead of displaying that kind of duty, it shows that one is better off listening to Chips.", "Another scene not in the book is in episode 3, where Catherine and Mrs. Wickett take care of an ill student. During a bit of the previous one, there was some tension between the women as they try to get used to the new arrangement after Chips marries Catherine. Catherine tries to make her mark with the house that she and Mr. Chips live in and to improve the boys' welfare, but Mrs. Wickett has her own ways of doing things. Once they find out about a sick boy living in the dorm that Chips is the housemaster of, they band together to help him get well.", "Having this scene in the series makes sense, for both Mrs. Wickett and Catherine are expanded from the book and previous movies. In the previous adaptations and the novella, all Mrs. Wickett does is serve Mr. Chips tea and remind him of what the doctor said. In the BBC television miniseries, she is the first person that Chips gives advice to after she - a maid at the time - tells him of her plans to run away. Because this happens on his humiliatingly first day of teaching, Chips and Mrs. Wickett form a bond that lasts until the former's death. There are even times in which Ann Kristen - the actress playing Mrs. Wickett - gives off looks that signify that Wickett may have certain feelings for Chips, but there's no real payoff to that. I'm not sure if it was all that crucial to enlarge her role, but it enforces her symbolism of the lasting impact Chips has on Brookfield.", "With Catherine, her role is more active in this version. Jill Meager's interpretation of the character is closer to her counterpart in the novella. Catherine is youthful and wants to make a difference at Brookfield. I wouldn't be surprised if Meager went to the Charlton Heston School of Teeth Acting, for she shows off her teeth a lot. Regardless, that gesture simply adds more charm and spry to Catherine's character. In addition, the miniseries plays more into Catherine's beliefs. There are several scenes in episodes 2 and 3, in which she and Chips discuss world events and trends that showcase how different they think. Moreover, this version even addresses the question I often had with the novella and the 1939 and 1969 adaptations: what does Catherine see in Chips? In episode 2, her friend asks Catherine about this, and Catherine replies that he's great to talk to and at listening even if he drives her mad with his old-fashioned ways.", "Since we're talking about performances now, I can't avoid discussing Roy Marsden as the title character. His interpretation is more somber than the previous actors, but his Chips has the sternness of the Peter O'Toole one and some of the warmth of Robert Donat's. In other words, Marsden's portrayal is the closest to the one in the novella. Much like O'Toole, his emotional growth is more gradual. This makes sense as the miniseries gives Chips more time to reflect on the actions and relationships he made and they impacted him. Additionally, I have to mention the physical transformation. When Mr. Chips is younger, Marsden is seen with a brown mustache that's similar to Donat's in the black and white version but less ridiculous. He also looks like the Count of Monroth from Baz Luhrmann's Moulin Rouge just with more forehead. Luckily, it wasn't distracting because he appropriately resembled a 40-year-old English schoolmaster. I can't say the exact same thing when Chips gets older. Although various camera angles hide the fact that Marsden is wearing a bald cap with pieces of hair on his sides well, there are times where viewers can spot the bald cap. Additionally, the makeup was caked onto him, especially around the eyes to make him look older. I haven't seen that much makeup to transform an actor into an old person since Orson Welles in \"Citizen Kane.\"", "The makeup is part of the bigger problem with this version, which is the budget. Before I explain, I want to make one thing clear: a movie or a television series can have a low budget, but still be creative in telling the story. When watching this, it's clear that they had to cut corners in translating it to the screen. This explains why miniseries couldn't do the bombing scene in the novella and do the makeup effectively as mentioned earlier. Additionally, they couldn't afford many child actors since only up to 30 appear in one scene at a time. Since the core relationship is between Mr. Chips and the students, scenes like the retirement speech are less impactful, for Chips is seen giving this to the teaching staff, not the boys. It's most apparent when there were outdoor sequences when lots of students are present that I swear were taken from the 1969 version. The miniseries was a collaboration between the BBC and MGM, and that latter company produced both the 1939 and 1969 adaptations, so I wouldn't be surprised if that was the case.", "If the budgeting is the weakest aspect of the BBC miniseries, then the framework of the show is the strongest. Each episode begins and ends (sans the last one) with an old Mr. Chips writing his book and looking back on his actions and relationships. This is a great idea because he had talked about doing this in the novella and the previous adaptations, yet he never did. This also successfully justifies why he's in such a reflective mood and going through each part of his life in a linear form. As much as I really like the 1939 version, it explains why Chips recalls his early teaching days (due to the new teacher at Brookfield), but not the rest. The framework of Mr. Chips writing his memoir helps explain why he's willing to analyze each episode of his life.", "To summarize, the \"Goodbye Mr. Chips\" 1984 miniseries works in some ways, but not in others. The miniseries format allows it to be more faithful to the source material. Certain expansions aren't always necessary, but they don't hurt the story. Obviously, the people involved had to cut corners, and it shows because it makes specific elements less effective. Despite all this, the framework is the best part of the miniseries. Like with the 1969 adaptation, I can see why viewers might like it, especially with Roy Marsden's performance and if this one is the first version of \"Goodbye, Mr. Chips\" they've ever seen. I would recommend it for those like Roys Marsden and want to see every version of \"Goodbye, Mr. Chips\" (like myself)."]},

Attenborough is giving us nothing less than the story of life on Earth, from the beginning to the present, but concentrating on a few key innovations (episodes bear titles like, `The Invasion of the Land', `A Watertight Skin', `Pouch and Placenta', and so on).  The other emphasis is on the poetry of life on Earth.  So it's not an even-handed history.  What we're getting is a look at the origin of particular things alive today: so birds get much more attention than trilobites; animals get more attention than plants; mammals get more attention than insects; and we hominids have a whole episode to ourselves.  This is as it should be.  When cockroaches start making documentaries, they can concentrate on what interests THEM; but tough luck, they can't, so it's our show.

Thirdly, the music score is really fun to listen to. Although it is distinctly '80s' sounding, each tune really tends to capture the atmosphere of the moments in the series. For just a cartoon series there are so many 'true to life' things in this series- like morals, the evolution of friendships, romance, financial problems and solving problems. Not forgetting the enormous geographical value of this programme- how many places do they visit throughout the series? Point proved. The only thing I have to say against it is repetition.

The great Ruy de Carvalho, a stage trained actor, manages to bring weight and importance to a rather dull script trying to portrait the \"real Portugal\" but it doesn't provide any insight.

By now, over 20 years later, the very same actors, most still work, do excellent jobs with the same format that has become a standard in Portugal by now. The stiff \"where and how should I look? Never mind.\" style with ridiculous over dramatization and bad timing is gone and replaced by a more relaxed and flowing style. Still the Brazilian telenovelas, most of these aired in Portugal as well, are miles ahead regarding the acting. Maybe Brazilians are always acting...", "The music, if I'm not mistaken by the late Thilo Krassmann, is surprisingly good.

But it drags through typical survival on island scenes. The girls can't light a log on fire--leaves, twigs, anyplace? It is different sometimes but not in a good way. Jerry Butler is the only guy on the island and he's in the first adult movie I've ever seen where the guy looks flat and soft before jacking off. Sex scenes are too shadowy or far away and the better ones spin by too quickly. The characters are shallow and they stall lines with \"king\" Arthur while bartering for food. We learn very little memorable about who they might be. The sequel, The Pink Lagoon, was a definite improvement, bringing in Raven, Jay Serling, and Ron Jeremy disguised as a native to wake up the sleepy plot with more conflict."]},

As a member of the first audience that experienced the Lumières' first screening, Méliès discovered cinema and immediately realized the enormous potential it had as a narrative art. During the following 15 years, Méliès would become one of the most important producers of movies, and he went from making amusing \"gimmick movies\" (films about Méliès making an impossible magic trick) to creating some of the most amazing stories of those years, using his skills to enter the genres of horror, fantasy and science fiction. By the year of 1902, Méliès was focusing more on his major projects than on \"gimmick movies\", but he still made several ones to test some new tricks. 1904's \"Les Cartes Vivantes\" was one of those shorts.", "As usual in his \"gimmick films\", \"Les Cartes Vivantes\" (literally, \"The Living Playing Cards\") is about a Magician (Méliès) performing an amazing magic trick. This time, the trick involves a simple deck of playing cards, and a large cardboard that resembles a blank card. The trick begins with the Magician making one card grow bigger, to the size of a book. Then, by simply throwing the card towards the cardboard, it becomes an enormous version of the card the Magician threw. As if that wasn't enough, the Magician transforms the giant card (a 9 of Spades) into the card of the Queen of Hearts. With that card on the cardboard, the Magician proceeds to to make the image come alive by transforming the drawing into a real life Queen of Hearts who walks out of the card. To finish the trick, he returns the Queen to the card and decides to transform the card into the King of Clubs; but the trick may be really on him.", "As written above, for Méliès this kind of short films were more than a way of having a fresh and original catalog of movies in his theater, they were a chance to test new or improved tricks and special effects he could later use in his major projects. \"The Living Playing Cards\" is a prime example of this, as it is composed of many of the tricks that Méliès had used in many previous occasions (dissolves, multiple exposures and several editing tricks), but the way they look in this movie is considerably better than when Méliès used them for the first time. When one watches the movies Méliès did before 1901, the effects look marvelous but primitive; \"The Living Playing Cards\" is the direct evolution of his talents, and it's easy to notice that his work of editing has improved considerably since his early years. His use of props and set design to build up an atmosphere has also improved, and he captures perfectly what his real performances as a magician would had been.", "Honestly, there's nothing really remarkable in \"Les Cartes Vivantes\" besides its amazing display of special effects, but like every Méliès film, it has a special magic that makes difficult not to enjoy them. Méliès had an enormous charm as a performer, and despite the shortcomings of the technology of his time, he really knew how to use cinema's potential to entertain his audience the best he could. While in the end, \"The Living Playing Cards\" may not be anything more than a \"gimmick trick\", one has to remember that in 1904, the legendary Méliès was preparing his most ambitious project to date: that often forgotten masterpiece named \"Le Voyage à Travers l'impossible\", better known in English as \"The Voyage Through the Impossible\". 8/10"]},

The reasons behind this apparent lack of interest were probably related to how costly and laborious was the process of hand-coloring frame by frame, as while his first hand-colored movie was done in 1897 (\"L'Hallucination De l'Alchimiste\"), he wouldn't attempt to make another one until 1903, when the hand-colored movies done by Edison's Studios became to be as popular as his films. That year, right after the enormous success of his masterpiece, \"Le Voyage Dans la Lune\" (\"A Trip to the Moon\"), Méliès directed 3 shorts that he colored himself: \"La Guirlande Merveilleuse\", \"Le Cake-walk infernal\" and \"Le Chaudron infernal\". Of the three, \"Le Chaudron infernal\" (or \"The Infernal Cauldron\") is the most well-known, mainly because this film followed Méliès' interest in the horror genre.", "\"Le Chaudron infernal\" (also known as \"The Infernal Boiling Pot\" by some sources) is a movie about an evil green-skinned Demon (Georges Méliès, of course), who works as an executioner in Hell. Another demon in charge of bringing him the condemned, begins his work by sending a woman to the Executioner, who joyfully ties her and throws her into the big cauldron he has in his room. His assistant brings him another two condemned, this time two male courtiers, who follow the woman to her fate inside the boiling pot. As the bodies enter the cauldron the infernal flames grow bigger and reach an enormous size. After putting the three inside the cauldron, the Demon stirs up the remains and suddenly the smoke that comes from the cauldron begins to form images that resemble the bodies of the condemned. Realizing that this are the souls trying to escape, the Demon will raise the fire from Hell to stop them from escaping.", "Among Méliès' many fantasy films, \"Le Chaudron infernal\" is definitely one of the most impressive of all despite its short runtime, as the addition of color takes the film to a whole new level, making Méliès' many tricks look even more amazing than before. To his usual array of dissolves and camera tricks, Méliès added the effects of drawing over the celluloid (an effect made famous years later by the \"Godzilla\" films of the 60s), using the hand-coloring technique not only to make the film look nicer, but to make an effect in itself. On a completely different subject, it's interesting to see that in this movie Méliès continues his preference for themes of horror and black magic, as he knows that it's in the horror genre where he'll be able to exploit his special effects to shock and impress his audience.", "Being objective, the only problem of \"Le Chaudron infernal\" is definitely its runtime, as considering that by 1903 Georges Méliès had already done \"Le Voyage Dans la Lune\", one would think that this film is a bit too short. However, there is a reason for this considerably shorter runtime: it's short because the process of coloring the film was lengthy, and Méliès wasn't able to make longer colored films (and as written above, that's why he only made 7 colored shorts in his career). Despite this problems, \"Le Chaudron infernal\" is definitely one of the most interesting movies done by the legendary French magician, not only because of its inventive use of color as a special effect, but also because of its place in the history of the horror genre. This movie is definitely pure Cinemagic. 8/10"]},

As with all films which start out as hardcore, the censors have cut it heavily to remove the most obvious hard stuff and used pan and scan to eliminate the rest. To supplement the short run time, use is made of repeating some of the clips. The use of very subdued music is a plus point because hearing the action in a porn film heightens the visual eroticism.", "In Cliffbanger the two male leads (Jonathan Morgan and Jake Williams) do not do any mountaineering but they certainly do more than their fair share of mounting. Jake Williams has the two best scenes on the pool-side terrace. These scenes are highly erotic and prove that women do not need hugely enhanced breasts to make an impression, just a director who knows his job. The final bedroom scene with Jonathan Morgan and female (it's a pity that female characters' names are not mentioned on screen or in the credits so that we know who's who) is also erotic but there is too much use of close-ups. This film is worth looking at again and again if only for that initial pool-side scene. An award of 7 stars seems well justified."]},

The sex is gritty just like the atmosphere though it well filmed and largely very erotic also. The acting does leave a lot to be desired, although Jason Carns is thoroughly convincing in the lead role. The film all boils down to the scenes at the end where we get to see the lead have his way with the murderess he witnessed earlier on and these are the best parts of the film. The film takes a bizarre turn and the sex scene towards the end is very brutal.

He's a talented porn character villain (I had just seen him opposite Carey in one of his best malevolent roles in COLD FEET). Carey's talents both as porn performer and actress are simultaneously on display as she begrudgingly lets Darby hump her, due to her hubby's workaholic neglect. She's utterly convincing as the passive zombie for most of the scene, and equally believable (not exaggerating as most ultra-groaner XXX stars do) segueing to sexual pleasure as he helps her towards climax. Top-notch vignette ends with Ron hoping for a long and lasting relationship, but Carey merely replies \"No thank you\" and splits.", "Tag scene has Carey returning to the hospital to give Bill a ride home, and they make up, with him apologizing and promising to try harder.", "Musical score is quite effective, utilizing Wes Montgomery's easy-going jazz classic \"Bumpin'\" from the Verve LP of the same name, and other guitar jazz, varied by a New Age echo-chamber ethereal soundtrack to accompany the nurse's fantasy sex scene.", "What might have been just another masturbation-oriented time-killer emerges as a well-rounded little movie."]},

Davian was not a pretentious filmmaker like these critical darlings, and his honest, if misguided, inclusion of lots of folk music performance by Pierce is far superior to the drek delivered by Oscar Isaac, now adding him to the roster of currently irritating leading men thanks to that \"breakthrough\" assignment.", "Pierce plays Clem, auditioning for a part in a Broadway play whose producer R.

Calcutta!.", "While Pierce opens the movie with a well-performed (direct-sound) folk ballad, we witness a montage of Times Square marquees at night, split between plays and 42nd St. movies, giving COMMAND a snapshot time capsule aspect. It's impressive what was happening back in '76/'77, as we see: \"For Colored Girls...\", \"Grease\", \"A Party with Betty Comden/Adolph Green\", \"Chicago\", \"Oh! Calcutta!\", \"My Fair Lady\", Helen Madigan & Starry Night live in a burlesk show, \"Pippin\", \"A Chorus Line\" and \"The Wiz\", plus movies including GATOR, CARRIE, HUMAN TORNADO, FRENCH SHAMPOO, LADY ON A COUCH, THE MUTHERS, ROCKY, BURNT OFFERINGS, VILLA RIDES and TEMPTATIONS.", "With improvised dialogue, film consists of several auditions plus extraneous humping scenes. Smoking a pipe, Bolla is less hammy than usual, merely savoring the power, shared with his co-producer, of selecting folk for his upcoming show. He ends up hiring everybody, a rather wishful and fanciful excuse for a happy ending by Davian.", "Mood is quite different from the usual Davian BDSM lite, except that one of the acts has Mark Le Beau abusing Susan Le Beau, leaving plenty of marks -shot live, no effects - on her posterior as he whips her, with the usual gimmick of the sub counting down the lashes as if working on a remake of MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY. He even puts her in stocks like ancient Salem punishments, but her blow job in such circumstances leaves a lot to be desired.", "Bolla's pair of cuties, Victoria Corsaut and Susaye London are great eye candy, but this hour-long porn filler has no story or structure to support it. Might as well have been a Major Bowes amateur hour with XXX content, for which we have to suffer through endless imitations on TV nowadays beginning with \"American Idol\".", "David Pierce, a fixture in many a Davian stinker, shows some real talent here - talent that apparently never got discovered the way Oscar Isaac did. If one throws away pigeonholing and stereotyping of porn for the sake of argument, and watches his performance as just another struggling show biz aspirant, one might come to the same conclusion I did regarding the relative merits of his work here vs. the studied, dead-on-arrival Isaac/Coens' similar imitation of real folk music."]},

As to his over-the-top praise for this junker, I will let you decide what you think.", "We're in crypto-Joe Sarno territory here, not the wife-swapping craze he so thoroughly documented in several '60s films, but rather the \"game\" of cheating. Film gets off to a rocky start with a series of brief but boring & often pointless vignettes setting up the theme of suburban commuters arranging liaisons on the side in the big city. A female narrator appears and talks directly to the camera before launching her \"knowing\" and snide voice-over to introduce the dramatis personae. Oddly, after a reel she disappears and the film's structure does a 180, with the thesps now handling their own dialog -which proves not to be much of an improvement. It all appears to be due to either post-production tinkering or just sloppiness.", "The convoluted and unrewarding plot line has two of the guys, Oakes and Ryan, out to humiliate their neighbor Dr. Rogers, because he's the only guy in their circle who's a prude and doesn't fool around. Local stripper Bubbles La Tour is enlisted to seduce Rogers and get him in trouble with his wife, which duly occurs after a tremendous amount of jabber, dull and unerotic softcore sex scenes, and a disastrous segue to bedroom farce that plays like a Special Ed high school class production of \"Noises Off\".", "As usual with failed films, there are many, many things wrong with this baby. Once the awkward structure settled down, the most glaring error was in the direction of the actors. This is not an attractive cast -other than hammy Ruth Conti as Bubbles no one looks the slightest bit like a candidate for a skin flick (big mistake!). They were likely stage thesps in need of a buck, but are directed (Bubbles included) to give arch, affected performances that are an immediate turnoff. This isn't Restoration Comedy, folks. Worse yet, there are pregnant pauses between each dialog reading -it never flows naturally at all. Harold Pinter would approve, but it doesn't work here.", "Since the film fails to deliver in the sex department, and is ridiculously tame for the adult theater market of 1969, it has to fall back on its story values and comedy, both woefully threadbare. Topping it all off, though this project had a budget, and even managed to film a commuting scene on an actually moving commuter train, the interior sets for a photographer's studio/bachelor pad and the like are hardly dressed at all, and shot so they look like big studio spaces. This is the kind of crap one gets with a 1-day wonder, not something striving to be a \"real\" movie.", "Original jazz score by Mark Levinson would be a plus except that it becomes repetitive and is not properly matched to the action -at times it drones on as pointlessly as the usual library music. Only cast member that sticks out (literally) is Ruth Conti as Bubbles, but she's overweight and forced to wear pasties in several scenes, not just the striptease -ridiculous. Hey man, this is 1969 already! The poor staging and clumsy editing of the big \"running around like a bunch of nuts\" farcical climax is unbelievably bad, and then followed by extraneous, boring denouement scenes. Typical of low-budgeters, a couple of guys are cast in this scene who look completely out of place, and they are -simply the gaffer and assistant director gamely filling the roles.

Trouper Veronica Hart takes over and through prompts and just plain moving forward at all costs handles both sides of the conversation, not too elegantly covering for poor Ms. Seka. Since the hardcore porn content of most of these films (though not all -see several great works of the period featuring Hart like A Scent of Heather) is and was clinically boring, such odd acting scenes are what stand out.

Title is the name of the leading male character, a young gangster who inherits his dad's half of the Frisco rackets, the other half of town allocated to the Vespucchi crime family.", "The film is dragged down from classic status by a needlessly awkward structure, as Pickett is something of an overachiever. Tale is narrated from a manuscript by newspaperman Clark Kent Rogers (James Haynie) to his fellow newsman buddy Bright Eyes (William Weeks) as they get drunker and drunker at their local bar.", "It's the saga of Cozy Cool (Michael Clarke), a flashy dresser in loud pinstripe suits who has inherited a crime mini-empire following the death of his dad Silvio. Cozy's right-hand man Mike (Vinnie Hardin) is plotting behind his back to sell him out to the rival Vespucchis, headed by patriarch Vespucchi Senior (Charles Goode).", "But while the boys finagle, the film is really about the amorous and violent adventures of Irma, a sultry and stacked hit lady played to the hilt by Maria Arnold. She was a prolific porn actress, memorable in the title role of the softcore Patty Hearst spoof TANYA, and given a true showcase here by Pickett. Sort of a porn answer to later character actress Joanna Cassidy -distinctive looking and brassy.", "She kills targets with a gun or poisoned pin, but what makes this hit lady different is she always has sex with them first -a treat for the fans. Pickett knows how to deliver an interesting storyline and maximize the stimulating porn content in equal measure -no mean feat.", "The fun is watching Arnold get it on with various guys and double cross her employers -it's never for certain where her true loyalties lie. At one point she tries out as a masseuse for massage parlor magnate Tyler Reynolds (uncredited) and I was surprised when she offed him. Later she makes love to a barely recognizable young Joey Silvera as Gay Vespucchi (he uses the pseudonym \"Gary Nelson\"), but doesn't kill him. This role is a couple years earlier than any of the nearly 1000 credits Joey has in IMDb, so it's a pleasant discovery -perhaps his first feature film.", "Besides the sex and murders, there's a well-done heist scene involving Vespucchi's safe, but a raggedly edited shoot-out climax, beyond the means of Pickett's low-low budget, is disappointing. The framing story involving the scribes' fate is heavy-handed as Pickett strains for irony and twists.", "Overall this is one of the better early XXX films, and makes me want to see Pickett's final movie RENDEZVOUS WITH ANNE, currently unavailable."]},

We presume he's her husband, but wrongo! (Or maybe he is -since the film doesn't make any sense in either logical interpretation of what transpires).", "Carol's neighbor Marie stops in \"for some coffee\" but gets a lesbian sex scene instead.

Mike meanwhile has a 3-way again with Carol & Marie that looks suspiciously like out-takes or just continuation footage from their previous scene. Betty joins them after admitting to balling \"20 cousins\" back in Montana: quantity rather than quality incest. The abbreviated print preserved for posterity by Something Weird ends abruptly mid-orgy.", "Whose husband is whose? That is the burning question raised by this empty little slice of life. The liner notes from the SWV shill predictably confuse matters further, calling the first mystery guy Mike, when clearly during the course of the film it is he who calls the other guy Mike.

A burly, uncredited tent \"doorman\" hams it up with comical asides and silly musical track turns the sex into comedy.", "Chance dreams of returning to the sheik's tent, risking his life for sex with the elusive Falana, and this is presented in the form of an erotic dream. The way the show goes off on these narrated tangents at will is in the classic style of Bunuel (Phantom of Liberty, Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie), and I found it beguiling, though most Adult Cinema fans would be unstirred.

Connors is her secretary, opening letters from a troubled public and duly reciting them (no memorization of lines required) while her boss gives blow jobs and then dictates inane suggestions to her loyal fans.", "Miss T's daughter is an 18-year-old cutie named Doris who drives around town in a convertible. Awkwardly inserted parallel story involves one Johnny Walsh, a timid 21-year- old who leaves his parents' home in the sticks to take a bus to the big city. Doris bumps into him and discovering that he has only $6 and no place to stay invites him home to her spare room in mom T's house.", "Scene where mom, daughter and Johnny meet at home establishes the film's oddest image: He's a very tall guy but Miss T looks to be about 4'9\" standing next to Doris and him. That was perhaps the only interesting moment out of 68 minutes of running time for me.", "Gimmick, not up to Damiano's creation, is that Miss T needs lubrication for her throat, so a steady stream of guys (which she pays for, Connors doing the bookkeeping) have to sit still for her blow jobs as she \"works\" at answering the public's letters, dictating (between slurps) to stenographer Connors. Carol looks so beautiful here she would be a show-stopper if in fact she were called upon to disrobe (nary a button gets unbuttoned) or have sex (unthinkable!) here. It reminded me a bit of her later audience-baiting (and disappointing) non-hardcore performance in the western SWEET SAVAGE, which capitalized on her name.", "Subplot has familiar porn actor Marc Brock as a guy whose wife won't give him head, so he's a natural for blow jobs from Miss T. Brock's comedic and improv skills threaten to surface but he is hamstrung by the movie's rigid and boring structure.", "Central scene late at night has horny Miss T accosting her tall new boarder with hand job and blow job while he sleeps. He wakes up but plays dumb, though when she's been satisfied and leaves he laughs uproariously, giving away the stupid film's \"surprise\" ending.", "This garbage is completely ruined by the casting of diminutive Miss T. Most of the footage is her boring blow jobs in close-up but she has no technique and is so unappealing that when it comes time for Brock's big money shot in her mouth, one-shot incompetent filmmaker \"P. Arthur Murphy\" splices in a huge-breasted, big-nippled woman jerking off a different cock in slow-motion with fountains of cum ejected vertically. This 2-second highlight is all the fans get for their $5 (or whatever the going rate was at the theaters booking this crap).", "A barely intelligent auteur would have done a rewrite and made Connors the titular lead, instantly exploitable as promoting the second banana from DEEP THROAT to star status in this ripoff. Sure she's too young to be Doris's mama, but I said rewrite or eliminate the blood-related daughter role entirely."]},

They jump over lines of people, crash cars, drive through fires and even lie in enclosed wooden boxes that are blown up with dynamite in a stunt known as the human bomb.", "These daredevils are all very young guys who are in their teens or early twenties. While the documentary follows them around, we really learn very little about the motivations of the individual riders. They mostly come across as fairly monosyllabic and reticent of saying very much. Nothing wrong with any of that, as they are young boys and their actions speak considerably louder than words but it's possibly a sign of the low tech nature of this film that little attempt was made to get their inner thoughts. The stunts themselves are obviously pretty dangerous, with little safety measures in place really; the film actually begins by naming various daredevils who died attempting the stunts the Death Riders carry out. In the current climate of today where health and safety regulations are taken so seriously, it is very interesting to watch lines of spectators being allowed to volunteer to be obstacles for the riders to jump over on their bikes! So, it's pretty obvious that this whole culture is from a bygone era and can now be viewed pretty much a sunny time capsule nowadays, a show that simply could not be allowed to exist anymore.", "Its very rawness and low key nature does mean that we don't see as much as we would probably like and it seems a bit haphazardly constructed a lot of the time. Yet it does capture a certain feeling of a time and place and that is rather a good thing. It's probably one as much for those with an interest in the 70's as it is for fans of bike or car stunts."]},

I know this because I saw it in the theaters back in 1974. You also can tell this wasn't filmed in 1979. It was filmed in 8mm. Rather odd for 1979, since the majority of releases were now being shot in 35mm. Vicki is supposed to be a hawaiian word and not anyone's name in the original release. This film is pieced together quite differently than the original release. There is bad editing in this movie which I believe was done purposely to prevent the viewer from discovering that the lead character is in fact, not named Debbie at all. The name Debbie is never mentioned once in this entire movie. There are parts of the original edited out of this release and the opening scene starts backwards. It's crazy! Not to mention the girl used a puppet to masturbate her boyfriend in the original but that was completely removed from this film. The other reviewer mentions a rape during the sex ritual scene but there isn't any rape at all. I don't know what he was watching but the orgy scene was just a fraternity initiation party. Since this movie was released in 1979, a year after Debbie Does Dallas, it seems rather odd that the main character is an 18 year old virgin. After doing Dallas, you would think she'd be a girl with a reputation by now. LOL. In my opinion, re-releasing this film as a sequel to DDD was just a means of making money off a very bad movie from the earlier 70s. If you want prove of the year it was originally released, you can find the original trailer for \"Vicki\" in Bucky's 70s Triple XXX Movie House Trailers Vol. 7."]},

It does have morals to impart regarding a life of crime and redemption, so while the ending is not completely upbeat, neither is it tragic. I liked the music; the songs are cheerful and not so Westernized. (One number takes place in and around \"Sam's Rocknroll School\", but rock & roll is more an influence on the dancing than the music.) This is the first film I've Madhubala in, and she was a pleasure to watch. Raj Kapoor is in good form, too; not overly sentimental or too clownish, he is in his charming prime. He also get to have some fun with his fame: his films Shree 420 and Awaara are explicitly referred to, and he is mistaken for...himself! (That's not a spoiler, if you read the cast list.)"]},

Independent Black Movies were the only way Blacks could be in movies, some of the filming and sound wasn't good but its worth watching. But this film is good, it matters where you get it though. These blacks were great actors, actresses, entertainers, and comedians, these films were the only way to show their stuff. Hollywood couldn't handle Blacks, I guess they knew it would give the white people a run for their money. Well, if you can get this movie you won't be sorry, I been looking for this for a year, and it was worth it. Nina Mae McKinney surely has the acting talents of a Clara Bow, Greta Garbo, and Ann Sheridan. But she's in a class of her own for sure."]},

When Hickson, a friend of Helen's, tells Dr. Hugh Leonard and Covey about a visitation he had from his dead mother's spirit, Covey expresses disbelief and bets Hickson that he cannot prove the visitation took place. Hickson accepts the bet, and leads the men into Dr. Ronald Webb's spiritualistic parlor. There the voice of \"Momba,\" an angry spirit, warns Covey that he will die later that night. The spirit also portends the deaths of Hickson and Leonard, telling them that they will die one day apart from each other following Covey's death. The ghost of Roger Fielding, Sr., the next apparition, tells his son, Roger Fielding, Jr., to prepare for his death. Later that night, Helen discovers Covey's dead body in her room. Bill is suspected as the killer, but Hickson believes that the spiritual portents drove the young man to suicide. Hickson, Bill and the others agree to keep the police ignorant of the death, and instead call on the famous detective Pierre Touissant and his assistant, Beefus, to help them solve the case. The following night, Hickson dies of a gunshot wound during a violent quarrel with a man named Jefferson. Hoping to flee from his predicted death, Roger takes the advice of Webb and sets sail for Argentina with a satchel containing $100,000. Touissant and Beefus prevent his departure, however, and return him to the Fielding home. There Touissant exposes Webb and his plot to get at the inheritance money by frightening Roger with fake apparitions and fake murders. A short time later, the police sergeant arrives with Covey and Hickson, who are very much alive, thus proving true Touissant's explanation."]},

Needless to say, if the plan goes ahead as expected, these guys are going to be in for a decidedly different type of excitement than they had in mind.", "Hustler Squad is one of many exploitation movies that were made in the Philippines during the 70's. It mixes action with a bit of sexploitation. It features a character called Major Stoney Stonewall – a man who, needless to say, doesn't play by the rules. His style of unorthodox thinking leads to the killer prostitutes idea. The girls are assembled from a convict, a rape victim, a hooker and a woman with a terminal disease. Production values are pretty basic as you would probably expect from a Filipino action flick and it rarely gives off the feeling that the action is really happening during the 1940's. The women especially look thoroughly like 70's chicks. But I'm not really complaining because I find this one to be a somewhat unfairly maligned movie which succeeds in entertaining from start to finish. The basic plot-line is a decent one and the action is generally quite a bit of fun. And there's always something undoubtedly good about seeing a bunch of women get together to kick butt in an action flick. This one is certainly rough around the edges in places but that's also part of its charm."]},

In addition, the locale of the new picture was switched from World War 1 Germany to a desert island by the simple expedient of inserting shots of bathing beauties on a palm-fringed beach throughout the film.", "Featured in ", " (1980)", "First off this movie or abridgement of an earlier movie was produced in 1918 as \"Over The Rhine\", a wartime comedy for crossdresser Julian Eltinge. For those who don't know who Julian Eltinge was, he was probably the 20th Century's most famous and successful Broadway drag actor. Im not a fan of crossdressing so I'll leave it at that. In 1920 \"Over The Rhine\" was re-edited and released as \"An Adventuress\". In 1922 the Over The Rhine/An Adventuress footage was further re-edited into a third version called \"The Isle of Love\" to take advantage of Rudolph Valentino's stardom and Virginia Rappe's tragic death both in 1921. Both Valentino and Rappe originally had supporting roles in the original \"Over The Rhine\" version of the footage. The only reason this film even has the nerve to survive today is because of the Valentino and Rappe situations. That withstanding both Valentino and Rappe are quite charming in their supporting roles and limited screen time and makes one visualize them as a movie team. The original \"Over The Rhine\" cut seems to be similar in theme to a Mack Sennett comedy made a year later called \"Yankee Doodle in Berlin\"(and on home video), whereas in Yankee Doodle in Berlin the hero infiltrates the German lines by dressing as an opera star or something. Both films made use of Curtiss Jenny biplanes probably on loan from the Air Service. There is also a terrific car chase in \"Over The Rhine\" that survived the edit to \"The Isle of Love\".", "THE ISLE OF LOVE \"The Isle of Love\"(1922) cut of \"Over the Rhine\" is the only version of the footage that survives today and has repeated scenes of Valentino and Rappe to the point that it makes the story incongruent. Virginia Rappe for all her troubles was obviously a beautiful and alluring woman and seeing her in this movie only accentuates the tragedy of her death. For viewers who are watching closely and have a sense of history about bathing suits, the style of frumpy bathing suits the girls at the beach wear early in the film dates from 1918 and the pre-war era. They are too conservative for 1922 which by then had see America have it's first Miss America contest in which the contestants wore 'one-piece bathing suits'. The story throughout \"The Isle of Love\" keeps tilting back and forth to a German war story concerning Julian Eltinge to the frolic at the beach without any sensible writing tying the two themes together. The title of the film misleads the viewer into thinking he's going to get frolic & gaiety on a tropical isle somewhere and what appears on the screen is some wacky story concerning Germans and a crossdresser. Indeed when Valentino and Rappe are on the screen it is a relief as they are so natural together and have great chemistry in the closing scenes riding in the touring car. The southern California scenery in the beach scenes are nicely captured by director Fred Balshofer and crew. If only they had not shot so much footage with the bumbling bearded beachcomber with spiked German helmet. He's as annoying as El Brendel. Mind this film has a lot of risqué scenes that would be censored for sure a decade later. One or two of the ladies at the beach have form fitting attire a la Annette Kellerman and Rappe has a diaphanous dress on showing her beautiful cleavage and rear end, before jumping into a pool. It leaves nothing to the imagination. Watching silent movies like this on DVD or the internet with freeze frame options one can see scenes of nudity that wasn't meant for the original audiences. The Eltinge character's girlfriend played by Alma Francis for example can be seen at the end of the movie being rescued from a pool. Despite her long dress she is completely drenched and for a brief millisecond the sun gets behind her revealing that under the dress she has no underwear on. No doubt films like this is what almost caused Hollywood to be closed down in the 1920s. Perhaps director Balshofer discovered in Rappe a girl willing to strip down giving credence to Adela Rogers St. John's description of Rappe in a 1980s documentary that Rappe would drop her clothes at the slightest provocation. Alas \"The Isle of Love\" edit no doubt got rushed through the printer once again in 1926 and re-released after Valentino's death to take still further advantage of his appearance in the movie. These constant re-releases assured that we would have copies to view today."]},

But his mother had ushered him into a back room to play with his sister when the two \"cowards\" came that morning so he didn't see his father shot but came into the room immediately after the gunshot. He saw his father lying on the floor and blood pouring from the back of his head. He watched as his mother cradled her dying husband--begging him not to die. He heard her cries and screams as the spirit of his father slipped from him and his mother realized the man she loved was dead. He certainly must have loved his father in those first 7 years and have been loved by his father in turn.

I'm sure the 1939 audiences came only to see the fight footage, since Armstrong held three world championships in 1938 (in the featherweight, lightweight and welterweight divisions) and still is the only boxer to have done that all at the same time.  But the boxing footage was disappointing too. You could see he and his opponent were holding back, and when he is knocked down, it's by a very light tap.  These items were partially offset by some very good performances by Canada Lee as his trainer and Willie Bryant as the heavy trying to get Armstrong to lose the big fight.

Often narrated by Laura, the series follows her simple farm upbringing from her childhood until her adulthood with Almanzo Wilder with whom she starts a family of her own. While the series is based upon the Little House books (and thus the real life of author Laura Ingalls Wilder), it is a very loose adaptation, with mostly only key events and elements of fact surviving the transition from book to TV series, the most important being Mary's eventual blindness, and Laura's future. Several other fictitious (some factual) characters make up the friendly community of Walnut Grove, including teacher Miss Beadle (succeeded by two other teachers, then Laura, then Etta Plum), Dr. Hiram Baker, Rev. Robert Alden, Mr. Hanson (of the Hanson lumber mill), and the well-to-do Olesons, owners of the local mercantile, and also the primary rivals of the Ingalls family (except the Oleson patriarch). Family friends include the Edwards family, the Garvey family and the Carters, who, in the final season, move into the Ingalls' little house."]},

In reality, Fort Huachuca was the home of the famous black Buffalo Soldiers of the 10th Regiment, renamed in 1935 as the 25th Regiment. Background information on African Americans in the military is supplied as well: The character of \"Gramps\" Tucker speaks about his service in the Spanish American War and the bravery of Black soldiers at Mindanao, Philippines. Rodney's father served in WWI in France. (By the way, the same oft-cited synopsis also lamely states that Rodney's father lost his memory in \"a traffic accident.\" I distinctly heard the actor say, \"a tragic accident.\") The print i have, a DVD from Alpha Video, is titled \"Where Is My Man To-Nite.\" ", "As with many Sack Amusement releases i have seen over the years, a reel of burlesque dance acts and \"exotic\" night club material has been grafted into this film with no attempt to link it into the plot. There is a title card that reads \"Featuring the Original 'Brownskin Models'\" but no other performers are credited. This footage was probably NOT in the original release. Featured are a jump-blues or proto rock'n'roll band with the monogrammed initials \"J.B.\" (Jackie Brenston???) and \"H.Y.\" on the drums and bandstand. The drummer and guitarist are excellent! Then we see several dance acts -- a West Indian-themed one, an \"Apache dance\" with hair-pulling, a rather ill-trained chorus line, a contortionist dance, a jitterbug (with the tall woman and short man found in many All Negro Cast movies of this time period), a very good break-dancer, and a couple of comedians. This errant reel has nothing to do with \"Marching On\" in any way -- but here it is, and it is quite pleasing as a documentation of early 1940s break dancing and jump-blues.", "Also, for train spotters, there is LONG footage of a train (Southern Pacific, i presume) approaching Fort Huachuca, Arizona, and a scene inside a boxcar."]},

Redhaired Johnny, a suburban Los Angeles teen of about 14, doesn't seem to have any friends, has a horribly bratty younger sister, and two rather old-seeming parents (they look in their mid-50s) who alternate between ignoring and overreacting toward his mild perceived misbehaviors. Dad in particular tends to fly into rages...when he's around, which isn't often (he travels a lot on business).", "Johnny really feels betrayed by them when his beloved dog suddenly dies (it's very old and has already had heart trouble), obscurely blaming his parents for that event because they insist on following local laws and having the city dispose of the carcass. (Johnny wants to bury the dog in the backyard.) At this tense point he rides off on his bike and is befriended by a hippie couple who nonchalantly get him stoned and drunk, then dump him on a park bench when he passes out and won't be roused. (They're irresponsible, but not mean-spirited—later they go to the trouble of tracking him down to return the bicycle he'd accidentally left in the flatbed of their truck.) ", "Unfortunately for the younger generation, Johnny is found in this state by an off-duty police officer who usually works with juveniles; he alerts the parents, who now think Johnny is on the road to ruin with drugs. So does the movie, for that matter, since naturally Johnny crosses paths again with his older friends, leading to a climax in which the kid tries to prevent the hopelessly stoned hippies from being nailed for possession, child endangerment, et al. by the cops that his parents have called to their crash pad. Naturally, there's a \"Diane Linklater\" moment in which getting too high leads to tragedy for one longhair. Of course, Johnny learns his lesson and dad (played by writer-director Philip Pine, who had a long journeyman acting career in movies and on TV) learns to \"relate\" better to his son. ", "This is the only feature of three listed on IMDb by Pine that anyone seems to have seen. From the evidence, one can imagine why: \"Pot Parents Police\" aka \"The Cat Ate the Parakeet\" is really amateurish (brief split-screen effects are so crude they seem to be somehow hand-drawn), with performers that seem to have been drafted amongst friends and family. The plot is so basic it could easily (not to mention preferably) have been handled in a 20-minute classroom short.

Perhaps her most ambitious short film, Wieland uses a simple premise to create a protest against the Vietnam War, making what was described by fellow filmmaker Jonas Mekas as \"one of the richest political movies around\". Her story is simple and told more in the manner of a silent film than by the action speaking for itself, but this is largely in due to the limited things she could do with her main 'actors'. As a whole, the idea isn't the most obvious metaphor to use for a political activism film, but certainly unique as an idea in its own right and carried off with a certain humor.", "The plot involves some rats (really pet gerbils) imprisoned in North America, their jailers being a pair of cats. Through title cards - which serve to tell the story since, as stated above, the acting job from the gerbils is extremely limiting - the narrative unfolds as the 'rats' escape this political prison and immigrate up to Canada (Wieland's native country). In terms of creating a metaphor, the film is very odd in its use of animal representation and plot structure: it is hard for me at least to see a strong tie with the Vietnam War within. If Wieland had crafted a more direct story involving real human characters, it would have been easier to fully understand what she was getting at, since this idea feels rather far out. As it is, one can at least vaguely see the film utilizing the concepts of imprisonment and rebellion.", "That aside, without looking at the symbolic side it's a pretty unusual and hilarious idea to be sure. The reason I called it ambitious above is obvious: working with animals to tell a story is not unheard of, but for an independent filmmaker not a very easy thing to accomplish. The whole premise is already very strange and the way it is told is even more interesting. What I found particularly funny was the use of sound in the movie: a lot of the music was completely out of place or jarring, particularly the fairground music at the end. Much of it was too funny to take seriously and I personally felt the story worked better on its own than when connected with any real political symbolism. A very odd film definitely but it does work somewhat despite the strange narrative."]},

There's something about both shows that really makes one think, as if such horror was not quite as far away as other horror movies you might have seen, sort of eerily familiar. Anyway, that's how it bites me. Nuts and bolts is easier. The acting holds this piece above many others. It's very very good. And it's a very large cast, so hats off to casting as well. There are so many (necessary) close-ups that any hint of wooden or uncommitted performance would be tagged straight away. As that never happens, hats off to the director too, it must have been gruelling. I could only get hold of the second half, and I thought that was too long. In the third quarter the effects are brilliant, and nicely edited as well, particularly where two timelines needed to be related. The last quarter is where I docked a point. There were effects that simply did not need to exist, as if the director had an incurable soft spot for old theatre pulley effects. If ever this movie is redone that needs to be thought about. It didn't spoil the ending in any intellectual way, I enjoyed the ending, but I thought it noticeably old-fashioned. On the plus side, the storm itself is a marvel of cinematography. All up this is classic horror from a very inventive mind, and, if you are lucky enough to run across it, well worth chasing."]},

In this brief film, director Méliès stars as a magician or prestidigitator who is able to detach his head from his shoulders and set it on a table, where it is able to converse with the magician in an amusingly delightful way. He continues to repeat the same illusion until there are three heads on two tables which are able to perform a sing-a-long with the master. Finally, in an amazing twist which I won't spoil, the magician is able to return everything to normal.", "Even though it's only a minute, \"The Four Troublesome Heads\" contains some points of interest that make its context more interesting. Not only was the theme of dismembered body-parts a common one in the filmmaker's career, the director would often perform tricks with dismembered heads--his own, most often--and this movie was the first. In \"The Man With the Rubber Head\" of 1901, he is able to blow it up using bellows (or so it appears) and the trick of a zoom combined with superimposition. In \"The Melomaniac\" the heads are music notes, thrown up on a telephone wire to form a line of \"God Save the King\". In \"The Mysterious Knight\" the head is actually that of a young woman who he can make appear and disappear, and even in \"Dislocation Extraordinary\" a clown is able to take his head off and sit on top of it. The disembodied was clearly a fascination of Méliès's is general; and the head was no doubt the most useful for the films in his perspective because it could show amusing facial reactions to delight and amuse the viewers.", "Yet, when you do look at it closely, you can figure out how the magic was accomplished. First of all, note how the head is not living when the director is holding it: merely a dummy head, used only briefly to fool the audience. The headless person effect was very simple also: a dark cloth used to cover the director's own head. This explains why a black background (very bland for a Méliès production as opposed to the beautiful sets he would paint for other movies) was necessary to carry the illusion. Why, I cannot explain. It's more obvious here than in the aforementioned films because the entire set is black, but if you pay more attention to where the head is disembodied in the later movies, you will notice it's the same way. Furthermore, while the heads are on the table, the tabletops will generally tend to shake around a lot, again because they and the heads are being superimposed onto the set. Méliès would later improve on this, but for the time it probably didn't matter since audiences had absolutely no clue how he achieved it anyway.", "Nowadays, \"The Four Troublesome Heads\" is often considered one of the director's best known films, and it's easy to see why. Not only are the effects amazingly well-done for 1898, Méliès's humorous performance carries the sight gags and makes them fun and amusing to see. He was a gifted actor, whether he played a frightened inn guest, a magician or Satan, and his joyful charm onscreen makes these shorts put a smile on your face. It's no wonder he played the lead roles in most of his films; not only was he forced to play them, he did a great job in them. Even though this film is 120 years old as of this writing, it holds up very well today and no doubt will keep you entertained throughout its brief run-time."]},

By the time MOTD stumbles on the air on a Saturday night, with its tired format and jaded on screen line-up, the football watching public have spent the day streaming their matches on the internet, and selecting extended highlights on Sky Sports of their team's game.
