It has certainly been an enthralling emotional journey for a show that is superbly crafted with well-defined characters, dramatic scripts, effective incidental music and marvellous location filming. Each season of the show follows an established pattern of introducing two new trainee British agents of conflicting backgrounds and personalities and after initial training they find themselves in occupied French territory attempting to put what they have learnt to good use. The German aggressor for each run is primarily personified by a significant officer. For the 1st season it was the softly spoken Colonel Werner Krieger (Warren Clarke), the 2nd season the unsettlingly quiet Colonel Voller (Donald Gee) and the 3rd brought us the barking mad power crazed General Stuckler (Terence Hardiman). The first two seasons pose additional personal complications for Liz Granger with the eventual disintegration of her marriage and her blossoming romance with Kit Vanston a highly effective operative whom she knew before the war. Each season concludes with a dramatic final set piece. In the 1st it is the rescue of Matty Firman from the Germans, in the 2nd it is the engineering factory raid coupled with the resolution to Vivien's renewed relationship with her daughter and in the 3rd it is the mass German assault on the Le Crest resistance movement. Personally I found the 1st season incidental music a trifle overpowering however there are some beautifully effective pieces used in the 2nd and 3rd seasons which helps to greatly enhance the viewers enjoyment. Although present in the 1st it is the beautiful location filming used during the 2nd and in particular 3rd season which is especially breathtaking and helps to significantly elevate this series against other World War Two drama series. Although all the regular cast contribute marvellously to the overall believable aspect of the series I personally would single out both Michael J Jackson & Kate Buffery for special praise for their outstanding performances as Kit Vanston & Liz Grainger, two stars whom convey such a resonate believable atmosphere to their characters, their previous history prior to the war and their newly blossoming romance in such dangerously difficult present times. Passionate delivery of scripted lines can also be appreciated from many of the series guest stars like Trevor Peacock (Renard), Nigel Le Valliant (Laurence Grainger), Shirley Henderson (Sylvie), Caroline John (Helene), Bryan Pringle (Father Martin), Jeremy Brudenell (Jean-Louis) and Stuart McGugan (Gordon Stewart) to name but a few. If you enjoy great emotive exciting drama with engaging character interaction matched with stunning scenery and appropriately moving incidental music then I strongly recommend you nab a copy of this series. I am confident it will be the wisest investment you have ever made!"]},

In particular, I hated Artie Shaw, no doubt from having seen this or other appearances in shorts and feature movies.

Among the myriads of plays, none is quiet as popular as the story of \"Der Brandner Kaspar und das ewig' Leben\" (eng: \"Kaspar Brandner and the eternal life\") and no version is quiet as popular as the 1975 version by Kurt Wilhelm. Like another reviewer has pointed out, the play is broadcast every year around All Saints Day and that unusual mix of play and mate-painting does indeed at times remind of Monty Phyton, but only in the best of ways.", "The story: Kaspar Brandner (Fritz Strassner) is an aging huntsman-assistant for the local duke, fond of drinking and the occasional deer-poaching (both regarded as folk-sports in Bavaria). During one hunting excursion he is nearly hit by a stray bullet. Little does he know what the Grim Reaper himself (Toni Berger) has only missed him due to the fact that his fingers were shaking due to the cold. Later that night Kaspar gets a personal visit from the \"Boandlkramer\" (roughly translated as \"bones-salesman\"), who informs him of his destiny and tries to convince Kaspar to come with him out of his own, free will. But the old mountain-man is reluctant to leave his earthly existence behind, manages to get Death drunk with Cherry-Schnapps and cheat him at a deck of cards. This buys Kaspar 18 more years of life, but he gets more than he bargained for, when his beloved granddaughter Marei (Yvonne Brosch) dies in an accident and the townsfolk become suspicious of his longevity. In the meantime Death has his own predicaments, since St. Peter (Gustl Bayerhammer) has discovered his 'neglect' at work and wants to force the reaper to bring the stubborn Kaspar to heaven, in order to be judged.", "Some films are simply magic and \"Der Brander Kaspar\" is one of them. You'd be hard-pressed to find many Bavarians who as kids didn't sit wide-eyed in front of the television-set, watching in wonder how the Grim Reaper transports Kaspar up to the gates of heaven, so he can take a peek into paradise.", "As said, technically the effects are nothing much to speak off. Most scenes that don't take place in Kaspars wood-cabin are clearly acted in front of a blue-screen, but the background paintings are all painted by hand and quiet beautiful to behold. Same goes for heaven itself (which is portrayed as a courtyard to a paradise that we never actually see). Here, all are typical Bavarians, be it St. Peter himself, the archangel Gabriel (Heino Hallhuber) or assembled angels, who drink beer from self-filling mugs and enjoy eternal White Sausages and Pretzels. The Prussians (Bavarian euphemism for North-Germans) have their own heaven and are not let in on principle, so St. Peter informs us. \"Otherwise heaven wouldn't be a heaven any longer\".", "Here it's interesting to note, that Bavaria is considered one of the most arch-catholic countries in Europe (in rural areas Protestants are still generally labeled \"the Mongols\"). At the same time, their form of Catholicism is almost practiced more as a form of folklore, while many traditions and thought-patterns still stemming from pagan times. Evidence of that can be found during the traditional \"Perchtnacht\" (the Bavarian carnival, where people dress up in demonic masks and celebrate the old pagan ways), the May-Tree-traditions or many aspects you will find in the \"Brandner Kaspar\"-play. People may attend Sunday church and believe in the various saints, but they're also sure that death is a Valkyrie-like figure, which flies you to Valhalla, pardon, heaven on his cart and serve you beer and mead afterwards. As to the numerous crucifixes and Jesus-figures you'll find on virtually every corner: Well, Allfather Odin has crucified himself unto a tree long before that, so there is no contradiction there.", "Despite all jest, humor, linguistic jokes and the premise itself, the story is quiet philosophic and also deals with more serious issues, such as death, loss of the loved ones, (possible) redemption and the need to let go at the right time. In that sense \"Brandner Kaspar\" Fritz Strassner epitomizes the archetypal Bavarian (or at least how the archetypal Bavarian would like to see himself): Jovial, fun- and life-loving, a scoundrel with a golden heart, yet also stubborn, defiant and self-reflecting only in dire need. The cast is altogether excellent, considering of the finest Bavarian actors of their time and veterans of countless TV-movies and series.", "To Bavarians I don't have to recommend it; chances are, they've already seen it more than once. To anybody interested in Bavarian folklore and mentality, it is a virtual must and a piece of culture, like the Hofbrauhaus, the Oktoberfest and the swan-ferry of King Ludwig II. A 10 from 10.", "Only one last warning word: avoid the tepid remake from 2008, where grimace-comedian Bully Herwig plays the Grim Reaper – it is everything that the original is not and vice versa."]},

From memory the Cowra Breakout is set during the 2nd world war, in which our two main protaganists meet, during a very bitter battle which I think results in the capture of the japanese actor and the returning of the aussie to a N.S.W town called Cowra. The Japanese are kept as prisoners in POW there camp and our two former enemies become friends. To be captured by the enemy is to be  absolutely disgraced and the only honorable thing for a Japanese POW to do is to committ suicide, which some of them try.

Perhaps a guilty conscience caused the pornmakers to throw in an actual plot for just the final reel - and it is so hurriedly developed and clunkily resolved that I half expected Charles Ludlam to show up impersonating John Cleese and arrest every one for violating logic, the way those Monty Python sketches would sometimes end.", "The editing scheme here is to balance dollops of light bondage/s&m with straight sex, sort of an equal time approach for distinct audience segments. The ubiquitous porn supporting actor Dave Ruby puts up with a lot of abuse from the dominant gals, but it is interesting to note that his howls of pain are fairly laughable when Wong gives him such tender love bites, slaps, or rakes on his back with her long fingernails. This is harmless porn.", "John Black, hired more for his package than acting chops, does go a bit over the line in his abuse of Rosy King, who portrays a hooker named Sharon who turns out to be an important character in the final reel. Perhaps this accounts for King being a one-shot porn thesp; she probably had that \"eureka!\" moment of self-realization during the shoot, wondering if this line of work (porn, not hooking) is really worth it.", "Of course, pretend abuse of one's fellow human beings is why these films were made -giving introverted sadists a chance for masturbatory release instead of (hopefully) acting out their morbid fantasies. Why there was such a vast quantity of these perverse films cranked out during the '70s (as duly documented by so many indie video companies) remains a mystery, but then again, the G-rated (and animated) feature film was an endangered species throughout the '70s too.", "Pirated music this time relies plenty on all-time jazz greats Jimmy Smith and Miles Davis's 1960s recordings, and it's a welcome relief from the unappetizing visuals. With long hair at this point, Mitchell is quite flatteringly styled, though her dramatic outbursts are laughably bad.", "Final reel has Zebedy Colt, looking prematurely aged, stomping into the film and literally dominating the women with his stentorian dialog delivery, decrying the \"youth culture of today\", and not letting Wong or Mitchell get in a word edgewise. He's searching for daughter Sharon and is mightily angry when he finds her hooking on Wong's premises. Violent finale is stupid, preposterous and of course, insulting to the audience."]},

This is porn-making of the shoot-yourself-in-the-foot variety.", "The story of Diamond Jim's ambition and fatal eating habits, and his endless run-ins with his ne'er-do-well brother Pat, is never gripping. Whenever it gets interesting one longs for a \"real\" film, not a porn treatment, as the acting is subpar. Robert Hall's earnest non-sex performance in the title role is underwhelming and fails to engender the desired sympathy. Following in the footsteps of Edward Arnold, his approach is merely flat.", "Attention was paid to convincing costuming, quality sets and locations, atmospheric use of a real steam engine train for footage of Diamond Jim's quest to demonstrate the viability of his locomotive -it adds up to an impressively mounted production. But what mainstream movie house would book this porn? Merely looking better than a Universal or Paramount B-feature misses the point; this is (soft) X level filmmaking, even if it's unsatisfying in the sex department.", "Before I give Corarito & pals too many left-handed compliments, it is worth noting that credibility is thrown out the window early on by casting a porn actress as Diamond Jim's mom -she looks about 25 years old in the flashbacks of the brothers growing up, and looks the same in footage set 30 years later. Strictly amateur night direction.", "Typically, the notes on the Something Weird video box are misleading, quoting Corarito from some interview as stating that two girls from Charlie Manson's cult were pressed into service for a lengthy cat fight in a bar scene. The two actresses we see are definitely soft porn talent, one of them even looks like Cara Peters, though they, like most of the other supporting players, are uncredited. One huge-breasted waitress serving Diamond Jim in a restaurant scene is typically underutilized. It adds up to a prime example of filmmakers who literally don't know what they're doing: the porn equivalent of that old saw of the comedian who wants to play Hamlet."]},

I got to see his masterwork NOTHING TO HIDE at a Manhattan press screening back in July 1982, and became an instant fan.", "Susan Westcott, a beautiful blonde porn star who almost exactly presages later superstar Sharon Kane in looks (and energy), gets perhaps her greatest showcase in this otherwise standard XXX movie. She plays the nymphomaniac Tracy of the title, confessing tearfully to her hubby in the final reel that she's cheated on him (he just caught her in the act with the neighbors), but she can't help it and is seeing a shrink regularly for her problem.", "Prior to that sentimentally handled payoff, it seems more likely that the uncredited actor playing Jeff (Tracy's husband) is at fault. He neglects her and though we witness him having sex with her (softcore style in opening reel), he's strictly interested in getting off himself, not her needs. That's made clear in the movie's opening scene where Tracy masturbates in bed beside her sleeping mate, after his quickie sex with her.", "A neighbor watches Tracy sunbathe, and comes over for coffee, immediately raping her twice in a relatively violent sequence. This was in the early years of XXX, before violent porn became strictly the subject of fetish films, notably those of Phil Prince and Joe Davian in NYC, with mainstream porn (to this day) eschewing violence for fear of censorship.", "It turns out, however, that Tracy was anxious to have sex with that neighbor, luring him on for the month since she moved in to the 'hood. Neighborly sex turns out to be the secondary theme of NYMPH, as an ultra-buxom brunette MILF living nearby seduces Tracy, treats her to vibrator and strap-on dildo action, and later has her join in for a threesome with her husband. The MILF is listed in IMDb as Annette Michael.", "Oddest scene is when the first neighbor tries to perform anal sex on Tracy, but simply can't, with visual evidence supporting the \"too tight to permit entry\" excuse. Why Spinelli included this footage is a bit cryptic -anal sex was rare in a feature film circa 1971, though obviously readily available in myriad stag loops.", "One drawback to the film is frequent re-using of footage, in the usual \"highlights\" mode of flashbacks, which pads the running time. Also, Spinelli has the male protagonists decidedly flaccid and \"short\" in their master shots, giving the strong implications that sizable and hard enough to be pointing skyward \"stunt cocks\" were used for the XXX insert closeups. It is these closeups that are arousing.", "I'm looking forward to discovering more Westcott films -she's a winner. She's the lead in the obscure incest movie BROTHER/SISTER directed by Mark Hunter, which is in circulation from two video companies currently but not listed at all in IMDb. That movie is particularly interesting in that both DVDs were transferred from incomplete prints in which all the XXX footage was crudely deleted; they stand as perfect examples of the exact borderline between X and XXX as to permissible content. I only wish a complete copy of BROTHER/SISTER will be found."]},

What stands out here is: Nina Hartley's two smoking hot sex scenes (that woman is always ready to go) and the astonishing beauty of Sandy Summers in the central role. She is absolutely amazing to watch. She's not a bad actress, either, and it's too bad that this was (apparently) her last role. One disappointment is the lesbian scene. Here's a scene that, by rights (especially taking into account the two amazing lesbian scenes in 3AM), should have been the hottest scene in the film, but is completely flat. I think the problem here is lack of interest. Summers just doesn't seem to be that interested in women, unfortunately, and doesn't shine until she's doing the men in the film.

Wendy Whoppers scene is the only one that seems to be simulated except for the money shot. Perhaps by choice of Miss Whoppers herself. I can only guess it has no connection to the original film. Despite its lack of cohesion, if you're looking for classic big boobed gals, they're here."]},

And especially a strong finale in which she's in a bordello watching group sex presided over by Mistress Dee (perfectly cast Janey Robbins as dominatrix).", "Always somber in tone and never falling into the traps of porno silliness, the movie ends on a note of literary horror, rather than the expected shock effects that generally permeate both the erotic and horror genres. Creative credits all go to \"Pablo Cairo\", pseudonym that IMDb identifies as Mark Novick (who when Googled pops up as the litigant in a '70s \"illegal search\" (for porn) court case more valid than the currently idiotic Trump complaints filed about Mar-a-Lago)."]},

I saw \"Dynamite\" about a year after \"Deep Throat\" at a grindhouse theater, Times Square in NYC. While not in a starring role, her few moments of screen time are fantastic. Although she had a brief anal scene in Deep Throat, with iffy camera-work and lighting, she makes up for it in \"Dynamite.\" There's no money shot, no oral, but if you're a Dolly fan, her anal scene is the best shot, best lit moment of her brief but incandescent career in smut.

You can guess what happens once he has gone, but is it just an one night stand or might it develop into something more? The film follows the ebbs and flows of their, frankly, torrid relationship. Drink fulled temper tantrums, acute jealousy and her inconsistent behaviour tests this otherwise mild-mannered younger man severely. Sadly, though, this film all just came across to me as too contrived. Initially they do fancy one and other, that's fine - but as their toxic friendship evolves, it becomes quite tough to watch because their love/hate/love relationship just isn't plausible. The ending is telegraphed by the retrospective narrative of the story (told by \"Erik\" talking to a police officer from the top of the film). For 1949, the dialogue and one or two of the scenes are maybe a bit risqué, but I wouldn't say this is one of Edith Calmar's finest works. It is notable for what it represents in terms of the development of cinema, and the fact that it has a woman director, but I can't say much more than that."]},

Her nephew Nandu is now 8 years old and she works hard to feed him. But Vikram Mayur, Nandu's paternal uncle, has come to India to take the kid to England, as he is the successor of their dynasty. That's the basic story of this movie, and it just does not work. Maybe it's got to do something with the fact that we expect more from Khan and his movies. Khan himself is pretty good and as expected he has a great chemistry with the leading lady. Sonali Bendre is very pretty and she does a fairly good job as well. The kid is okay. The film's music does not add that much. English Babu Desi Mem has its moments, but they are few and are not enough to make a watchable film.

Michael Knight plays Bedman, with a young Tami Monroe playing his female sidekick Throbbin, who can never resist the urge to seduce him in costume. Rick Savage has a great time as 'The Jokester,' inspired by Jack Nicholson's then recent turn in the Tim Burton movie, getting it on with both Throbbin and the commissioner's daughter, Barbara Hardon, while Bedman ensnares the luscious Pussy Woman (Veronica Hall), after she performs a tongue lashing with Barbara (the adorable Summer Rose). That's really all there is. The static, unmoving camera renders the sex scenes rather boring, a shame since I loved all three girls. Director Joe Sarno was nearing the end of dozens of low budget titles with the same sets, setups, even identical beds! Starlets such as Cara Lott, Siobhan Hunter, Annette Heinz, Nina Preta, Krista Lane, Stephanie Rage, Jessica Wylde, Brittany Morgan, Charlene Cody, Tasha Voux, Rachel Ashley, and the Gabriel twins made the rounds in each and every video, mustering up all the heat required to make up for the numerous shortcomings. Summer Rose was an irresistible redhead who didn't quite achieve top stardom, while Tami Monroe, prior to various enhancements, was making an early appearance under the name Darcy Derringer, with small, natural breasts, and curly, strawberry blonde hair (her short stature is unmistakable). For me, Veronica Hall steals the show as Pussy Woman, and who could resist those cute ears atop her beautiful brunette curls? (Tori Black proved to be a disappointing Catwoman in the 2010 parody). Perhaps best known for her role opposite Kathleen Gentry in John Leslie's original 1988 CAT WOMAN, and with little more than a dozen titles in her brief career, she was always a favorite starlet of mine from the 80s. With her perfect 60s hairstyle and gyrations, gorgeous Alexis Texas stole the show in the 2010 XXX BATMAN (with Lexi Belle's amazing Batgirl a close second), which faithfully reproduced the look of the 60's TV series, while this long forgotten entry resulted from the 1989 Michael Keaton release."]},

Therefore the following cites Falconeer (by \"\") at some points, while adding several own thoughts.", "First -- I can only underline Falconeer's remark that \"the creators obviously have an almost reverent love and respect for this special time of life before we must accept responsibility ... So I find it profoundly sad to read so many people trashing this movie, based on the scenes where the kids are playing and swimming plainly nude.\" Having surmounted the threshold of doing away with their clothes, \"the characters don't even seem to be aware\" any more of any peculiarities \"of their being naked, so I have to wonder why it is such a big deal for the adult audience ... kids ... would have a deeper understanding of it than many adults\". Yes, indeed.", "Second -- \"Genesis Children is showing the difficult journey that we all take\" in order to become what we always were, and to that end the boys are taking part in a 'play to be performed before God'. At a certain point close to the end of the film, after having engaged in a 'ritual' of burning an old van which they had rammed into their self-built shelter the day before, a turning point of the play is reached, where some of the boys decide to leave the place and the play. Here I locate what is perhaps the central sentence of the film: 'Aren't you going home?' asks one of those who have put on clothes again and are about to leave. 'I am home', replies one of those who stay. In a somewhat cryptic manner one could say that some have not moved during the play and are therefore bound to leave and continue their quest for 'home', while the others do have moved and therefore can stay.", "Now I want to put forward another essential point. One can view the message of this film as the third part of a trilogy. On Aikman's own home page (still available) there is noted 'Often compared to Lord of the Flies'. This other classic, filmed after the famous novel by William Golding just 10 years before The Genesis Children, refers in turn quite explicitly to Ballantine's novel 'Coral Island' from the mid-19th century. In all 3 cases the theme is the acting of a group of (male) kids left alone on some island or shore (i.e. deprived of a direct civilized environment and set out in a purely natural setting), with an undertone of investigating where evil comes from or how it is overcome. But while in Ballantine's novel the point of view is clearly optimistic in the colonial sense common in the 19th century (Wikipedia: 'obsessed with the purity of God, Trade and the Nation, and written for the future rulers of the world'), Golding decidedly destroys the optimistic world-view of a self-proclaimed master-race. In his story, which like Ballantine's still features dominance, struggle and victory or defeat, these impulses do not create an ever growing sphere of ordered civilisation, but lead into complete destruction within the shortest possible time. Here Aikman's film appears as a response to Golding's 'solution', and its purpose is, I believe, to feature less crude impulses than dominance or struggle and victory. There is never aggression or any struggling for dominance between these children, who in the beginning practise a fully cooperative way of living with astonishing ease and great naturalness. I think Aikman wants to show that this way of living is endangered in the first place in a more subtle way -- 'boredom, hunger and homesickness were our enemies, and that's why we started to argue'. Instead of aggression it's a feeling of futility with regard to the quest for 'home' by some of the boys, which finally divides the group.", "This leads to my final point. Other reviewers were concerned that so much nudity might be considered a bit gratuitous. Much nudity? If I count all the nudity scenes, I end up with about 1/8 of the film, and even in this moderate part nudity often can only be intuited, because the boys are visible only in the distance as silhouettes against the light or otherwise blurred. The nudity scenes are not to bluntly showcase naked bodies but do have some particular message. They never lack respect and reverence, and above all they are presented as sort of sacred dance and breathe a sabbatical ease and peace, underlined by the music score changing to liturgical songs and church bells and evoking allusions to Psalm 126 (\"release of captives\"). I wished -- pedophiles-hunters, calm down, there's nothing here for you to get -- they would take 1/4 of the film or more. By the way, that they appear predominantly in the first quarter of the film is also a reference to Lord of the Flies. And gratuitous? I suggest to view it just the other way round: in the natural environment into which the Genesis Children are placed there's no need for a specific reason for being naturally naked, rather there have to be reasons for wearing clothes. And in fact, there are a few scenes where I find it a bit gratuitous that the boys appear more or less clothed. Where Golding sees civilisation compromised and endangered by the brute struggle for dominance exploding to plain war in the end, it seems that Aikman wants to show (among others) civilisation and humanity compromised long before by the much subtler struggle for dominance and by the hiding game clothing is a part of, and he wants to explore what still can compromise when these dangers are removed, and to what extent they can be removed at all. In this sense, there is quite a surprising finale, which rounds out the numerous (but in their essence not explicit) religious overtones of the film.", "Btw, it is also a quiet film. Out of 84 min. total runtime just under 25 min. (29%) contain speaking (thereof 6 min. background narrator voice). The rest is underlined by the music score or by just the natural sounds of the beach. I consider this noteworthy."]},

In the PBS version, all mention of the mice representing the adults was removed, but the narrator still commented that Clara had to bring the couples to life. On the current DVD, and on all PBS telecasts now, all narration stops after the opening scene. The narration was removed without having to cut any of the music or the dancing; both have always remained intact in all of the versions of this \"Nutcracker\".", "Edited into ", " (1997)", "Although I am no dancer, I have always taken a big interest in ballet, because I love the music, the stories and the choreography. This is especially true of The Nutcracker and all of the Tchaikovsky ballets.", "The story of the ballet is timeless, and I loved the decision they made here to make Clara go on a sort of journey character-wise, starting off as a young girl and maturing throughout. And of course Tchaikovsky's music is outstanding, very sparkling and elegant.", "This Nutcracker is wonderful. The only disappointments for me are some muffled sound and some of the sets are rather murky-looking for my tastes, however some of them do look very nice.", "Any small faults aside, the costumes are gorgeous, and the camera work and editing are excellent. But what makes this excellent production are the dancing and the leads. This production puts a lot of emphasis on intricate dancing and choreography as has been said before, and this was a decision that paid off and was entirely successful, not just in the duets and group dances but especially in the solo performances, my favourites being the grand party and Kirkland's dance involving jingling bells. As great as Mikhail Barishnikov is here, and he is, very, the star of the show is Gelsey Kirkland, who nails Clara's character and her dancing is just breathtaking.", "Overall, a real festive bon bon. If in the want of lavish sets maybe this is not quite the production to sink yourself into first, but if in the want of fine performances and some of the best attention to choreography and dancing you'd want, look no further than this. 9/10 Bethany Cox"]},

I'm not really sure of the meaning of the title, \"Riverdance\", but I believe it has something to do with leprechaun-like water spirits; there is an emotional element of fairyland magic or the revelation of a mystical dimension that is somehow inside the world we normally inhabit. The Irish are true survivors and now, finally, their country is emerging as one of the most successful economic powerhouses in the new Europe--they have amply shown that they have the strength, magic, and spirit to prevail; may they long and abundantly prosper.", "Beyond the spiritual and physical dimensions of these performances, there was a great intellectualism, too, a mathematics and spacial relations in the dance routines that was an amazement and a delight to the mind as well as to the eye.  What a joy it all was to behold:  such smiling stamina, such expressive integration with the rhythms and the emotions of the music, what beautiful and humorous people who seemed to be having as much fun exploding their controlled energy on stage as it was for the ecstatic audience to watch them.", "And finally, Michael Flatley, obviously the star of the show, never quite lorded over everybody else or succumbed to what might be a justifiable arrogance, but freely expressed through winks, smiles, and various pats on the arm signs of warmth, appreciation, and love for his fellow dancers, which was a great pleasure to see.", "I happily wear green on St. Patrick's Day and my roots are from somewhere on the British Isles, but now that I've seen \"Riverdance\", I really wish that I were Irish!"]},

I've been on a Little Rascals (or Our Gang) binge recently and when I viewed the Miss Crabtree shorts, I looked up June Marlowe on this site to see if she had made any movies after her stint as that teacher on the series and this one was listed. The fact that former Our Gangers Mickey Daniels and Mary Kornman were also in it whet my appetite as well. Well, I've finally seen this one and the June Marlowe who appeared wasn't Miss Crabtree at all just a brash singer who wasn't so bad during the dance sequence. Oh, and I just found out the star of this movie was one Dave Sharpe who was a stuntman for Hal Roach Studios (he did those backflips for Margaret Mann's Grandma in Fly My Kite) and also was one of the players in The Boy Friends series for Roach which also starred Mickey and Mary. Anyway, this was quite a funny movie not only for those stunts Dave did but also for some dialogue exchanges between Mickey and Mary (and look, he finally got that kiss from her after persisting throughout Fish Hooky a few years back!).

He was a capable, hardworking actor. With his young-old face and simple delivery, he was often cast as the nice guy, as he is here. The trouble is that he isn't particularly charismatic on the screen, so a few years later, he was blocked from real stardom because MGM had Jimmy Stewart, and Fox had Henry Fonda, and they pretty much burnt up all the air for that sort of role. He continued to work, 180 features and almost 90 roles on television, because he was capable and hard working. He played bit parts and featured roles, because, once he was out of the Poverty Row B movies, he never got between the camera and the people it loved, the stars.", "We remember the stars and think about the smaller ones who fell and continued to work, like Buster Keaton, Chester Morris, and Toomey, as failures because of the inexplicable workings of the cinematic world: destroyed by jealous or incompetent executives. In truth, Toomey was a success. He had a long career, he worked a lot, he had two children with his wife of 56 years, and died at 93. What he lacked was that mysterious combination of a camera that loved him, and the luck to find the role that everyone adored. Would he have been any happier as someone with a big contract with one of the majors? Like Mithridates, he died old."]},

Then one day a mysterious man by the name of \"Argyris\" (Giorgos Foundas) starts coming into the bar once a week with eyes only for her and after finally speaking to him she begins to believe that her chance to get away from it all has finally come true. Unfortunately, when some drug traffickers enter the picture and large sums of money begin exchanging hands things start to change pretty quickly for both of them and their relationship becomes extremely strained. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a standard drama which was greatly enhanced by the presence of Ketty Theohary. In any case, it's worth a look for those interested in a picture of this sort and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average."]},

Long before \"Boyhood\" (2014) followed one boy's life over the span of many years, \"When I am King\" (1981) did something similar. Two children (played by Blake Dennis and Lark Geib) were filmed in a modern-day setting in which we see they have formed a friendship. They imagine themselves living in Medieval times. The story they are imagining then plays out on the screen. We see the two children 9 years older. Rather than cast older actors to play these roles at the same time the filming was done with these two children, Wanda Appleton stopped the film's production for 9 years and filmed the Medieval-themed portion of the film with the same two actors, 9 years older. According to the liner-notes, they were 10 and 12 during the initial filming, and 19 and 21 when the film resumed production. ", "The Medieval story harks back to the modern-day setting in a dreamlike fashion which takes on the feel of a literal nightmare, a nightmare based on the Brothers Grimm fairy tale \"Jorinde and Joringel\" (aka \"Jorinda and Jorindel\"). Because of the blending of two conceptually parallel stories in a non-linear story line, I found the film confusing to follow the first time I watched it. The film credits show the film was written by Wanda Appleton and her husband, Peter Appleton, albeit loosely based on the Brothers Grimm fairy tale. The book which accompanied the videocassette I purchased was authored by only Wanda H. Appleton, and has excellent illustrations from artist Rosiland Solomon. (This film has yet to make it to DVD or streaming.) After reading the wonderful book and researching the Brothers Grimm fairy tale, I watched the film a second time with more understanding of the background, and I better understood the writers' vision.", "What director Wanda Appleton likely did not anticipate was that Blake Dennis and Lark Geib, who had good screen chemistry together as children, would not have good screen chemistry together as young adults. Once upon a time Oscar-nominated Stuart Whitman and veteran actor Paul L. Smith gave their customary strong performances, the cinematography and costume design were very good, and the film included some nice ballads, each based on an aspect of the film's story line.

You may notice some young actors who become very famous, and even though the props and styles are of the 1960's and '70's, the subject matter's still very relevant.\"", "What the good Pastor does not mention is the fact that many of the character actors who appeared in this series already had long resumés, faces that were familiar both then and now. Some were already famous for acting in TV series from the era, shows like \"The Andy Griffith Show\", \"Lost In Space\" and \"My Three Sons\". Perhaps not surprisingly, some of these actors are barely recognizeable, a testimony to their talent and flexibility for different roles. Therein lies the strength of this series. However, it was not only the acting, but also the professional quality of the production and direction that I personally always found mesmerizing.", "These days, there is also the same entertainment value one might find in watching any old films. As I said in one of my episode reviews, \"most of the series is now 50+ years old, and often hysterically dated.\" But younger film and trivia buffs may get a kick out of this show, and those who paid attention when they were young will definitely experience some nostalgia."]},

Don't look for deeper meanings, series in those days were mainly about archetypes. My grandmother used to sing that song in her moods when we came to look at Wednesday's television afternoon for children. We didn't have a TV ourselves back then; we (my sister and I) always went to her place to watch so my grandma could spoil us with fried potatoes, candy and self-made orange popsicles. Many, later known as famous, Dutch actors featured in that series but that's the story behind many of these series. Thinking back and trying to recall what's been done there I must say it's minimal, one camera recording all live is not a perfect condition for a perfect delivery but it was the beginning... How to compare that to nowadays series or movies is impossible, you're bound to put the bar too high to remain objective. So what are the instruments by which you can measure the validity of a series like that?

Winnetous Rückkehr (1998) was produced by the same staff and shot in same locations as the franchise series from 1960s.

TV documentary about Karl May on YouTube - \"Das letzte Raetsel\" (2016). It develops the thesis that Karl May was a psychotic personality with multiple identity syndrome. Narrator is a respected psychiatrist from Germany who had long time done research with Shatterhand Estate in Radebeul (near Dresden) where Karl May Archive is located. The Archive tend to embrace the voluminous heritage of the Author, i.e., some 90+ separate \"Bands\" of titles which consist of novels, short and long stories, travel notes and few autobiography books. Truly Nietzschean type of Superman this guy seemed to have been. Most of the presumptions for disorder personality are based on his photo archive, enlisting several big albums with photography shots thought to be forged. And how about his regular sessions at Vila Shatterhand where he presented personal \"I\" narratives. He even provided at sight the famous \"Henry Carbine\" with which he never parted during his adventures.", "Whether one believes in that matter, did he or did he not traveled, is problem of personal choice. Karl May did not produced his many friends that he described in his novels. Neither his several wives witnessed. He only produced photographs, many letters and the books he wrote. Many materials have been lost in time and two World Wars. In my country, I have some 40+ volumes \"Bands\" translated and most of them in the period 1977 to 1997. Then there are older translations before 1950s and some of them severely adapted so that you can get lost. All in all, there is good concordance between original Karl May plot and screenplay of the Winnetou franchise series from 1960s. Worth reading the whole Karl May heritage and I am in process of doing it.", "Now, my good American friends, why should we argue about the quality of Karl May legacy. You simply haven't read the Author in a way that you have read James Fenimore Cooper, for instance. Or you don't know that his first writing attempts were Ghost and Mystery stories like Edgar Allan Poe's. But he quit because they were such bad written stuff. Karl May became a real celebrity only when Winnetou appeared in his stories, also Kara Ben Nemsi in Africa and Ottoman Empire, also Dr. Karl Sternau in Mexico - Latin America, and also some other series that haven't appeared in Film (from South Pacific, Siberia, etc.) Enjoy your time ..."]},

But baddie Raul (Aurélio Teixeira) and his gang want to profit by placing bets on Zé's failure and will do everything to stop him from winning.", "In the 1950s, Anselmo Duarte was the #1 male heartthrob in Brazilian movies, starring in very popular comedies and dramas for the two biggest Brazilian studios at the time (Atlântida in Rio de Janeiro, and Vera Cruz in São Paulo). \"Absolutamente Certo\" is his debut as director/ writer (he also plays the leading role) and it's symptomatically a \"mélange\" of styles of the two studios: the technically \"sophisticated\" treatment of Vera Cruz (good camera-work by British D.P. Chick Fowle, agile editing by Spanish José Cañizares, above average budget) and the \"popular\" feel of Atlântida (especially because of slapstick comedienne Dercy Gonçalves in the cast and the tacky -- or kitsch if you will -- staging of the musical numbers). Though plagued by a fatally banal plot, Duarte's debut as director is surprisingly assured, undoubtedly helped by the experienced crew. There are two really good sequences in the streets of São Paulo (one in a white Jaguar, the other in a streetcar), better than average sound recording and well-staged fistfights. What it lacks -- direly -- is real laughs.", "Besides loudmouth Dercy Gonçalves (who's so over-the-top she's hysterically unfunny; notice she's made up to look like Fellini's Gelsomina), the cast includes gorgeous kittenish Odete Lara in a star turn as a double-cross blonde, parading her sexy hourglass figure, dancing provocatively, doing her own singing, driving a Romi Isetta (which MUST be the frailest, wackiest car ever made) and giving Duarte a French kiss (very bold at the time); Lyris Castellani in the \"Zezé\" number, who owned the thickest, meatiest pair of thighs ever employed in dancing; and craggy faced Brazilian boxing champ Paulo de Jesus, in the underdeveloped small role of a struggling boxer who has his arm broken by Raul's gang.", "Don't expect much, but don't underestimate \"Absolutamente Certo\" -- it's from the time when a \"good director\" meant an \"efficient director\" and a \"good comedy\" meant a \"popular comedy\", before the auteur theory and the Cinema Novo (New Wave) movement changed Brazilian movies in the 60s. Duarte tries but can't quite mix comedy and drama (few filmmakers can, anyway), but he had ambition and drive: remember his next film was \"O Pagador de Promessas/The Given Word/The Payer of Promises\" (1962), big winner of Cannes' Golden Palm (against formidable competition) and Oscar-nominated for Best Foreign Film. ", "Overall, \"Absolutamente Certo\" is a harmless pastime, an honest film and a curious period piece, if only to see how Odete Lara and São Paulo looked like in the late 50s . But it's certainly ironic that it deals with (and criticizes) the public's fascination with then incipient TV industry in Brazil -- the very same TV industry that in just a few more years would wipe the \"chanchadas\" off Brazilian screens, by ripping off its themes, stars, style and form."]},

I do think that this one here at least keeps you entertained throughout the 8-minute running time and it also makes you interested in the story being told.

Black Sheep Boy is a series of thoughts carefully ordained through a sequence of images focused exclusively on young men. Nakedness and full frontal nudity becomes a metaphor that elicits basic philosophical questions. The nature of Beauty, for example, as Plato's understands it, is the never-ending search of an ideal, thus the narrator of the film never ends his search for that one boy, who can only be grasped or intuited in his multiple encounters with countless nameless boys. The essence is unobtainable. And what is one's relationship to beauty? Beauty is nothing but a veil that we use to cover up the horror of mortality; according to Nietzsche beauty can be found in true art, according to Kant beauty exists because death exists, and beauty is that which reminds us of death while at the same time reaffirms our vital urges. Ultimately, death veils the real, covers and masks the certainty of death. All of this is present in the narrator's observation about life.", "Black Sheep Boy however lacks the clarity that most people would look for, it can be very academic at times and this is made obvious through the constant quoting of Baba's book about \"The Problem of Sex\", a book that owes much of its genesis to Foucault's \"Histoire de la sexualité\"."]},

After some research he finally realizes that a Satanic cult is behind the murders. Outside the historic claims to the film there's really not too much here, although I must say that the movie, while pretty bad, never got too boring. The low budget (apparently 27-thousand) adds a certain charm to the film but the screenplay is still rather weak and we get some incredibly bad performances that don't help matters. There are several childish death scenes with all sorts of blood and guts but even the special effects aren't that special.

This really comes off as the type of film where people are wanting to make cash and there's no real effort to make anything really good. I will admit that the movie is certainly a lot better than a lot of direct to VHS titles but that's still not saying much."]},

It is not a drama or a documentary, it is what you would have seen if you'd been sitting in the theater. Only two things are different from a regular show; there's no audience, and the length is abbreviated (only 76 minutes, whereas the full show may have run from 90 minutes to 2 hours). There is some topless nudity and sexually suggestive dancing, but no full nudity or pornography.", "The chorus line consists of only 7 women, and several of them do strip acts as well. That's cut in half from the 14 that were in the Follies chorus for the 1946 \"Hollywood Revels,\" and their routines are very simple, just walking in time to the music. But still, this is a real chorus, a touch of class that pretty much vanished by the end of the 1950's.", "All the comedy scenes are relatively clean, probably at the filmmaker's behest. Don't expect belly laughs; the delivery is good but the material and empty theater keep things kind of flat. The first routine features Bobby Faye and Leon DeVoe, an eerie mind-warp that showcases DeVoe's dramatic acting as a man who inhabits a world only he can see, and in which Faye gradually comes to believe. Subsequent skits include the anti-nudist society, a school daze routine, and \"Does he have the guitar?\" with Harry Arne at his baggy-pants best. \"Guitar\" has a second meaning (don't ask). There are a lot of double entendres.", "Gay Dawn is the star of the show. She is good if not great, interesting and very likable. Imagine a cross between Anne Francis and Amelia Earhart. Although her act is titled \"Desire\" and includes some world-class grinding while kneeling on a platform, she does not come across as sexual, more like a tomboy-ish older sister who's stripping on a dare. Other notables: Mary Andes contributes two specialty dances and comedy work, and acrobatic dancer Loretta Miller (\"Leonora\") is very impressive. FYI, for some reason, all the principal ladies except Gay Dawn and Mary Andes were given single-name pseudonyms in this movie. \"Leonora\" is easily recognized as Loretta Miller, and \"Rochelle\" as Lily Ayers when she was brunette (she's in the chorus and opens the first comedy scene). Co-feature \"Sylvia\" looks like Sugar Kane (aka Sylvia \"Sugar\" Kane, who I believe later used the stage name of Thunder).", "The film print is in excellent condition. No splices or scratches, no physical deterioration, and the movie appears to be intact with nothing added except 2 minutes of Pat O'Conner's act spliced in (0:43:35) from the 1947 \"Night At the Follies.\" The strip acts of Rochelle and Levalon are omitted, but this may have been the way the movie was originally released. Cinematography is excellent for the genre, with two cameras being employed (the norm was one). Only failing is that the lighting is a bit dim, or maybe the VHS transfer is dark. Audio is glorious synchronous sound throughout, a rarity for these low-budget films. The microphones even pick up an emergency vehicle's siren going by the theater as Charlie Crafts sings (0:02:50), and when the chorus parades we can hear the clumping of their shoes on the boards.", "Something Weird Video offers around 30 of these burlesque actualities (not including the \"Grindhouse\" compilation series), and \"Everybody's Girl\" is one of the best in overall combination of cast, show, filming, and condition. Highly recommended.", "2009 UPDATE: SWV has a new version of this movie. The review above was based on a VHS I got in 2003, the print they now offer on DVD-R runs 7 minutes longer and all of it is the original film, nothing spliced in. The missing strip acts are all here; Levalon, Charmaine and Rochelle (Lily Ayers). In this early performance Lily hides behind a fixed smile and does a brief, standard strip. Nothing tells you she's going to be a star. Nine months later she was featuring at Minsky's Rialto.", "The only bad news is, while the VHS was dim, the DVD is too bright, with facial features and other details being washed out. Hopefully SWV will select \"Everybody's Girl\" for digital remastering and then we'll finally get to see this great show at its best."]},

Wisely, minimal dialogue is used here, relying on a natural chemistry between the actors, and moments like eavesdropping or looking through a photo album.

Helga Sven has never looked better, and her two scenes are delightful. Lying back with her eyes closed, fondling her gigantic breasts and instructing her lover to \"shoot it all over me\", in that wonderful Zsa Zsa voice of hers, and in a lesbian scene where she pops ones of those breasts into Penny Morgan's mouth, and hearing Penny sigh contentedly as she sucks on Helga's nipple with the delight of a newborn baby. Those are two reasons to watch this, and they're basically the only ones. Kari Foxx is completely wasted here, her two scenes barely register. Buffy Davis does indeed look like a younger version of Helga, so having her on board as the daughter had a lot of potential for a mother/daughter incest scene or perhaps what could have been a scorching three-way. Instead Helga just does a bit of fondling & foreplay before turning her over to Peter North to have his way with her, but first he asks permission to \"finish my drink first.\" (There apparently was no script to this or if there was, no one bothered to read it; in another scene, Tony Martino introduces Helga to his date, \"Kathy\", who immediately informs him that her name is \".Kelly\") Peter North's scene with Buffy does \"end well\", as it were, with Pete supplying the \"finishing touch\" that he was known for. Which can't be said of a prior scene with Kari Foxx, where the \"climax\" is largely wasted. Buffy Davis is just okay in this, her oral work on an otherwise barely there Herschel Savage is as good as anything Andrea Parducci or Juliet Anderson ever did, and hearing her little girl voice telling Peter \"I want it in my a** (Didn't she always?) & instructing him to \"pump me\" would get anyone's libido percolating. Penny Morgan's (she wouldn't become Rachel Ryan for a couple years) boy/girl scene is distracting because her vi-jay must have loaded with spermicide or some sort of lubricant which is leaking out all over the bar. In fact she uses a seltzer dispenser to clean herself off when it's over. This was filmed in an actual LA bar/nightclub. There are real Leroy Nieman prints on the walls, so that likely explains many of the glitches-the filmmakers probably only had use of the place for a limited time, one or two nights. But the main problem with this is the director's style: He usually has two scenes going simultaneously & switches back & forth between them. So the viewer is getting into the scene with Helga & Tony Martino, which is excellent, only to have the movie switch to Kari Foxx & Peter North's scene, which is not. Either Roy Karch has a low attention span or he thinks his audience does."]},

Medina speaks haltingly a few words in heavily accented English, then takes over as voice- over narrator spoken by someone else without a trace of accent, but forced to recite endless gibberish undoubtedly penned by Tobalina. ", "The narrator's comments about \"herself\" ring about as true as what the old men's magazines of the '50s and '60s used to call \"semi-fiction\": the blurbs about models (their bio, likes & dislikes) appearing in photo spreads, or perhaps the soap opera arcs of Vince McMahon's WWF became WWE rassling organization.", "But the fake loquacious voice-over Iris likes to praise others, naturally her producer Tobalina (the only guy who ever hired her for a movie), and her favorite stars Annette Haven, John Holmes and Sharon Thorpe. She rambles on about Haven over and over but only later in the compilation do we get to actually see a very young Annette in a cutting-room-floor worthy three-way segment.", "Man of her dreams Holmes shows up to end the film in what may or may not be newly shot footage - routinely humping Iris and \"THE END\" mercifully superimposed on screen arbitrarily after he unloads his wadd on her belly. The main discussion of Thorpe accompanies a scene focusing on a different actress altogether.", "The endless clips are mainly orgies, for which the narrator reveals Tobalina's philosophy and in my mind his undoing, as she asserts \"Orgies are always a turn-on for audiences\". CT is fond of making claims with no research backing them up, and movie orgy sequences, especially his, are generally show-stoppers in the worst sense of that term: they cause the film to grind to a halt and are never as stimulating as a torrid pairing or three-way. ", "Her narration is often beyond stupid, as in lines like: \"They love to perpetrate their love and passion\", referring to (another idiotic claim) adult film talent appearing on screen in an altruistic sense of wanting to please people, not for the money. This, like the usual tell-tale defensiveness of \"porn actors are not prostitutes\" (she even claims they are as good a set of actors as mainstream thespians) is tiresome b.s. propaganda similar to the still-in-circulation on video intros that cloak pornography under the \"free-speech activists\" umbrella. I'm waiting to hear what future president Rand Paul has to say on the subject, given his extreme libertarian views on most everything else.", "Among the random XXX scenes, culled from films like HER LAST FLING and THE ULTIMATE PLEASURE, is even a black-and-white 3-way loop featuring Joey Silvera and Leslie Bovee. One lengthy orgy sequence is defective, but Tobalina includes it anyway, having the narrator apologize a couple of times for the \"flare and glare\", even giving the blame to Iris who supposedly worked as camera operator (we see dumb shots of her standing behind a huge (Mitchell?) stationary camera with Fernando Fortes as focus puller), and when she is actually on screen victimized by said f&g, carefully explaining that Tobalina on camera is not to fault because he had inherited the faulty camera settings from her. Hey CT, why not scour your vaults and replace the faulty footage with something else buddy?", "Which of course raises the question of our dear video distributors, in the last throes of reissuing vintage porn on DVD (let's ignore streaming for the moment) to a gullible but rapidly dwindling modern audience (myself especially included, since I am a prime customer). What are the criteria for rejecting some crappy old film (or defective one whose decent elements have been lost and only an inadequate print or VHS copy remains)?.", "Vinegar Syndrome which is inflicting the Tobalina oeuvre on both shills (see many of the IMDb reviews, excluding mine) and curiosity seekers is only the latest purveyor to pretty much ignore content quality, although they have been relatively scrupulous in terms of utilizing decent materials for video transfer - I'm talking here about issuing well-preserved versions of worthless junk.

The thrill has gone out of their marriage and as the title suggests fantasizing and acting out one's fantasies may revive it.", "Leon goes to visit an old pal Casey, a brothel madam played deliciously by guest star (from the East Coast) Georgina Spelvin, who speaks in a cute Southern accent that at first reminded me of Kathy Bates' memorable Baltimore twang in TV's recent FREAKSHOW. She advises him to bring wifey to an orgy at her place, and Sharon reluctantly agrees, with the proviso that she can leave at any time. (Sounds like the current BDSM hokum promoted in 50 SHADES OF GREY and its \"safe word\" mythology regarding escaping from rough sex.) We are already treated to a fantasy of Thorpe all trussed up in a dream sequence.", "The orgy is relatively tame with voyeurism emphasized as Tyler Horne takes Sharon under his mutton-chops wing and they (and we the audience) watch some oil wrestling as sex starring Desiree West and various couples humping, notably prime hippie girl Toni Scott (of the unmatched frizzy hairdo) being humped from below on a rotating suspended wicker basket chair.", "Overlong film has lots of other sex shenanigans, but doesn't get to the point until Sharon and her husband decide to take a second honeymoon in Carmel but inexplicably split up to drive two cars there separately. Just as Sharon is about to get into her station wagon for the trip she is assaulted by Horne, John Lesile (in a non-speaking role at the outset of his career) and evil (for a change) Joan Devlon, my favorite of the Frisco talent pool.", "They rape her vividly and this being porn she begins to love it half-way through the rough scene, giving as good as she gets. Punchline of the film is not surprisingly her signing up with Spelvin to attend more orgies, just don't tell hubby.", "I enjoyed FANTASY IN BLUE as softcore porn, but preferred a XXX version without all the silly coyness. These actors were all capable enough to have mainstream acting careers."]},

I guess if you actually twirl your mustache you qualify for an acting award, but what these two do is the modern equivalent.", "During the soft-core era of porn, namely the '60s, there were innumerable poor movies made that not only didn't live up to their lurid, over-the- top synopses (in most cases an impossible task) but were simply dumb & pointless on purpose.

This film was made when the AIDS crisis was cruelly killing off so many, and putting others into a state of torture through fear they might get infected, or already were, without knowing it, but were too afraid to find out. Also, in society in general, the spirit of the times was lethal towards the homosexual population. The fear of drinking from the same teacup that a gay person had drunk from was no myth, and that was the nice side. Psychological cruelty was rampant, even among gay men themselves. I experienced a lot of this before and after my partner died.", "It is in this context the film was made, in all its six small scenes and 18 minutes of length.

I wonder how many people were given a respite from fear and a hope for a normal life again, and how many read the words on the screen 'Marry Me' not ever dreaming that this too would become a reality. This is not 'Maurice' set in the first years of the 20th C and in its way it was more relevant to those who were going through such mental struggles. And in my opinion, simply from the expert silent actors and their clear passion for each other, the director managed to express equally silently. look how simple and normal love is. Or as D.H.

I found Kemp to be very energetic and he certainly had a presence on screen. I learned from the review at IMDb that he actually died in a car accident nearly seven months before this was released so I'm sure it had a different impact in 1941 than it would today. The most interesting thing were some of the visuals by director Joe Negulesco. One includes a lot of shadows, which really makes you wonder if Val Lewton and his gang perhaps saw this thing. The \"noir\" feel during this number is something I'm sure fans of that genre will enjoy even if that genre was still several years from coming to be."]},

He had also quite a few directing credits, one of the first ones being Jengi from 1963. Time has rendered the rakish youth portrayal rather campy, but it certainly is not without its charm even decades after its original release.", "The movie tells the story of Paavo and Eeva (Esko Salminen and Tarja Nurmi), two rural teenagers bored with their uneventful country lives. Looking for new experiences, they decide to move to Helsinki against the wishes of their parents and find work as a construction worker and bar waitress respectively. However, the sinful attractions of the big city soon put them in danger: a wild gang led by a tough leather jacket wearing punk named Kale (Ville-Veikko Salminen) lures Paavo and Eeva reluctantly participating in (or at least witnessing) various naughty activities, such as drinking, promiscuous sex and street fighting. Of course, this kind of lifestyle is no good in the long run – something the young couple comes to learn the hard way.", "From a modern point of view the cautionary message seems dated, if not outright comedic: the clean-cut youngsters twisting to the music of none other than Eino Grön look anything but dangerous these days. Still, I enjoyed all of the music in the film, ranging from vintage rock'n'roll to the jazzier pieces accompanying the gang's noisy strolling through the nocturnal city. The romantic score during the softer scenes works fine as well. Visually, the dark streets are very beautifully lit during the night scenes, making the exteriors very pleasant to watch. As a Helsinki native, I also generally enjoy seeing how the familiar streets looked in the 1960s, long before my time.", "Even though at first it looks like there is not a single positive thing to be found in the city of sins, later on the mood is softened by a few understanding supporting characters. Particularly the always good Siiri Angerkoski brings a breeze of kindness to the mix in the role of Tilda, a motherly worker at Paavo's construction site and his eventual landlady. On the other hand, the slang-speaking gang members are amusing to follow too, especially Ville-Veikko Salminen as the bullying Kale and Liana Kaarina as the oh-so-depraved Pipsa.", "The gang's immoral antics are paid so much attention that the movie inevitably carries a slight exploitation vibe, even though modern audiences are unlikely to find any of it very shocking, perhaps apart from an attempted rape at one point. Considering the earlier raunchy tone, the epilogue in the house of Paavo's parents comes across as even more old-fashioned than it probably was originally meant to be. So, under the youthful surface there lies a conservative message, but other than that, Jengi is an entertaining flick and provides a very interesting window to the youth culture of the early 60s – well worth a watch for fans of classic Finnish films."]},

He was in African prison for a yr, and didn't say a single word", "Warden Keefer (John Aylward) & prison doctor Dr. John Murray (George Dzundza), have kept Powell with the criminally insane prisoners. Keefer says that Caulder has been assigned as temp staff to the prison to get access to Powell. So Caulder will have to attend to all patients in the prison, not just Powell. Caulder reluctantly agrees as cracking the Powell case promises a rich career down the road.\nDr. Powell, who has been with a group of gorillas during all that time, is not talking at all, and seems to be living in a dreamworld. He is heavily medicated and is disciplined by prison staff if he makes any sudden moves. Caulder knows that Murray is incompetent and hence medicates the patients and turns his back when they are tortured.", "Caulder reaches out to Lynn at Powell's house and gets photos of his life in Africa and the Gorillas. Powell reacts to Caulder and knows every word and sentence out of him will be great scientific curiosity.\nVery slowly, Dr. Caulder manages to reach Ethan (he negotiates a private room, where he and Powell can talk) and starts finding out why he killed two of the poachers. Yet, Theo's case is not just about why the murders have happened, but also about how Dr. Powell became the being he is in the first place.\nWith Ethan's silence broken, Theo is introduced into a world beyond common human comprehension: The true nature of being. Powell made 21 trips to Africa across 12 yrs to study the Gorillas. Powell was studying one particular group of Gorillas and got very close to them. He took pics, and then began to study their habits. Each day the gorillas allow Powell to come closer to them and they missed each other. Suddenly one day, he was no longer observing the group and was inside it. He decides not to return to camp and opts to stay with the tribe.\nHe learns that mankind's control of everything is a mere illusion (Powell argues Caulder is not in control of anything and he is mistaken about being free as he is a slave to his ambition) and that the true values of existence can't be found so easily. Ethan changes Theo's view of things forever. Powell wants Caulder to share his story with the world, as he himself if not of the human world anymore.", "Powell says that man is more harmful that a jungle could ever be. Prison guard Dacks (John Ashton) had a system where he would throw a card into every cell at random and the prison who gets a ace of diamonds, gets to go out and spend time in fresh air. The problem was that a bully prisoner would shake everyone, snatch the ace and he would be the only one who goes out. Murray says that this keeps the prisoners anger on the bully, instead of the guards.\nCaulder changes the system to pick a random name out of a box, and once a name is called, it doesn't enter the box again. This way everyone gets to go. Dacks beats up Powell, when he refuses to reveal his ace, and eventually backs off when all prisoners tear up their cards.\nKeefer is angry at Caulder challenging prison authority and reduces his evaluation time with Powell to just one more week.", "Caulder takes Powell to meet some gorillas in captivity.\nEventually it is revealed that during the course of Powell's stay with the gorillas, they accepted him as part of their group; he was attempting to protect his great ape family when the poachers (led by the forest rangers) arrived and started shooting them. Powell attacked and killed 2 poachers before being shot in the knee by a ranger. The silver-back tries to come to his aid and is shot dead as well.\nHe gets a hearing to reveal the truth, but an attack by a vicious guard on another prisoner causes Powell to be reminded of the killed gorillas, at which point he violently attacks the guard (Dacks) to stop him, is restrained and stops talking again.\nBen convinces Caulder to walk away from the case as Powell will never come out of the prison.\nAt the end of the film, Powell escapes from prison using a pen to dig out the lock on a window, and heads back to Africa."]},

The film paints the portrait of a burnt-out welder who one day decides to change his life, literally walk away from family and friends in pursuit of a festering dream. It's a symbolic jouney that can't help but be frought with peril and take him unexpected directions. Jerome is not the name of the said protagonist, but rather a small artists alcove in the middle of the Arizona desert the film's anti-hero, Wade Hampton, has uprooted his life for. It's a place he knows only through a postcard and once the free-spirited, drifter Jane shows up, Wade's seemingly straight-forward itinerary begins to buckle. Jerome is refreshingly introspective, given its familiar subject matter. Wade's pursuit is marked by such innocense and singleness of purpose, his conviction in his dream so total, that he succeeds in blocking out the inherent emptiness of such a quest. Beautifully photographed, Jerome is a thoughtful, stylistic and understated piece of filmmaking, a road trip into the core of everyday human dissatisfaction where the route is seldom straight and the destination is never the final stop. It is the road less traveled and assuredly a road worth taking."]},

I have seen many short film from this production company and usually they all fall into the same mould but I was very glad to see The Jogger try a different style. The plot is pretty basic and it will be no surprised to anyone to learn that the mysterious jogger is not actually a real man – in fact it is my belief that he is none other than death himself. In that regard the film is made more interesting as our man manages to put death off and evade him for a while but, ultimately, he cannot escape him forever.", "In this way it is perfect short film stuff – quirky plot, simple delivery and a good (if predictable) ending. The delivery is what makes it and it is directed with a steady hand that produces reasonable tension throughout. O'Quinn is a recognisable face (Alias, X-Files etc) and he does well in the lead, however the actual jogger himself is not mysterious enough – he doesn't have enough screen presence to really care the role but he does well enough I suppose.", "Overall this is an enjoyable short even if it has dated and lost much of the surprise that it may once have had. When I first saw this a decade ago I was blown away by it to the point that I still remembered it all this time later – however, watching it again it didn't quite have the same effect even if it was still enjoyable. A good idea with a clever (if obvious) meaning that makes it more interesting, all delivered by a good writer/director and a strong lead performance from Terry O'Quinn."]},

However, troubles are caused by the schemes of Irvas and his business partner Berg (Joel Rinne), as well as several romantic misunderstandings.", "Even though the movie is not really a genuine musical, the plot quickly becomes secondary to various musical numbers like songs, dances and even a puppet show. Luckily the score by Martti Similä sounds very nice and the opera singing and ballet dancing are entertaining in their own right, which is fortunate for the movie considering how much time they take from actually advancing the plot. Not that the story is too strong to begin with: the writing goes for the most obvious jokes and all the tensions between the characters soon fizzle into nothing without much effort. Being his usual lovable if not too handsome self, Aku Korhonen may not be the most convincing love interest for the cute Sirkka Sipilä, but who cares, unlikely romances are pretty much a staple of the genre anyway.", "Everything mentioned in the paragraph above is true until the very last scene that completely changes the sugary taste the movie had been leaving in the audience's mouth before. The melancholic twist can feel like a disappointing downer at first, but I think it ultimately raises the movie above run-of-the-mill musical nonsense, as much I like silly song-fests. In any case, despite Norta's direction coming across as a bit aimless at times, I enjoyed Jos oisi valtaa a lot, largely thanks to the charisma of Korhonen and the numerous musical scenes. In the end, the bittersweet tone earns the movie a place among my favourite Finnish films of the 1940s."]},

That may not be your forte, and that is fine. If it isn't, then you may wish to watch something else, if however you like seeing the protagonist kick butt all the way through and not even get touched, this might be for you. Caution Templar is a member of a Mining Company's police force. His brother was as well. Caution is there to investigate his brother's disappearance and death. He kick-boxes his way through henchmen and finds out why his brother is killed. On his way he meets Doc Halliday (Shari Bellfonte) and they work together. He also meets an irritating sidekick and I was thankful to see he didn't have much in the movie. This is a C+ movie. It is not ground breaking stuff by far, but given the facts in the trivia, that this movie was shot in an old shopping mall on 1 million dollars budget and a short time, it is not terrible. It will not compete with Total Recall or other A list Mars movies, but it is like your first car, rough around the edges, but gets you there. It is worth your time if you can see past a few faults."]},

The film's pseudo-European trappings were a promotional device to convince audiences they were watching a \"foreign film\" at a time in US cinema history when \"foreign\" suggested greater sexual content.", "Featured in ", " (1986)", "Having being orphaned earlier in her life, \"Angelique\" (Arlene Farber) has grown up into a beautiful young woman who easily attracts all the men around. Her main problem, however, is that her foster parents don't treat her very well and, after a heated argument, she is thrown out of the house to fend for herself. But as luck would have it, just days before the argument, she just happened to get into an accident while driving her bicycle and was offered both a job and a place to stay by an extremely wealthy businessman named \"Count Orestes Medici\" (Vassili Lambrinos). Naturally, having nowhere else to go, she decides to accept his offer, even though she fully realizes he wants her to fulfill more than just her duties as a maid. The problem, however, is that Count Medici has an adult son named \"Alain\" (Andre Landzaat) who thoroughly detests him and is determined to have Angelique for himself. Now, rather than reveal any more, I will just say that I initially thought that this was either an Italian or Spanish movie but, after some brief research, discovered that it was simply a low-budget American production which was intentionally masquerading as a foreign film instead. Since the reasons aren't exactly clear to me, I won't speculate any further. What I can say, however, is that this film contained quite a bit of nudity along with several scenes of a sexual nature--none of which were that particularly erotic, in my opinion. To be sure, Arlene Farber was definitely quite attractive and performed reasonably well, all things considered. It's just that these scenes were too generic and lacked the necessary chemistry or passion to really capture my attention. Of course, others may disagree and that's perfectly okay with me. In any case, I wasn't very impressed with this movie and I have rated it accordingly. Below average."]},

The latter part of the film, which shows a male couple making love in their bedroom, is a far cry from nearly all of the gay male pornography made in the last half-century.

But what they shared in front of the camera in 1975 was by far, in my estimation, the most beautifully intimate lovemaking between two men ever filmed."]},

Headed up by screen favorite Frank Zagarino(Barbarian Queen ), \"The Protector\" also features the talented Matthias Hues(Cyber Vengeance) and Steven Nijjar(Needful The Final Goal). Directed by action veteran directors Boon Collins, the mastermind behind such action spectaculars as \"Abducted II: The Reunion\", \"Night Warning\", \"Escape to Grizzly Mountain\", and \"Escape to Grizzly Mountain\".", "In the role that shot him to stardom, Zagarino plays Cole, a super special agent with a dark past. He has to protect a man with no memory (Steven Nijjar), who has lost his children and wife. This great plot brings us the best of the best of action classic movies. Gunther(Matthias Hues) is the evil guy, who knows everything about about the two good guys. With great flashbacks we'll get immersed in this excellent movie. Non-stop action scenes to delight the audience. Great scenarios, and you'll get to see high quality traps, shooting scenes that makes Die Hard looks like a Steve Martin comedy, great performance by the actors, especially Zagarino, a very underrated actor who should be getting a major role in any high budget Hollywood movie and especially girls, lots of very pretty girls to make the male audience happy. About the plot, we'll get to see the darkest side of good men and the way the good guys solve their problems to lead them to the final victory. ", "\"THE PROTECTOR\" succeeds is because it presents every challenge Cole has to face realistically and clearly. As the tension mounts, the ordeals for Cole become increasingly harder. First, it's just a grunt. Then a whole slew of them. Later, it's the protection and even the fight with his protected! Director Boon Collins gives the film a good pace and makes the film work by showing that Cole isn't superhuman; he only uses his brain more than his punches. Also, screenwriter Jeb Robert Cousins adds touches of humor that lighten up the viewer and classic one-liners (\"Cole, John Cole\") that ignite the screen. Their subplots actually add to the story instead of overcomplicating it, especially one featuring the undercover cop (Meeka Schiro)", "Overall, this movie was awesome. Zagarino is very believable and has significant screen presence. Character development is superb. And after all this, the soundtrack is just great, at the same level than John Williams classics. Paul Nelson can be proud.", "Note to Parents: the nudity, drug use, continual profanity, and extreme violence would make this a bad choice for kids under 13. Otherwise, see \"THE PROTECTOR\" ASAP!

Being from Texas does not make me a judge of horse flesh, but I've seen every one of the \"Black King\" films---hey, some of us have just lived wasted lives--- and I have a sneaking suspicion that whenever Leichter gathered up the $86.99 necessary to cover all cost of production, he dropped by Fat Jones' hoss-rental stable and took advantage of whatever Blue-light Special Jones had going that day on horses, and rented the cheapest one possible, whether it resembled the preceding Black King or not. I could be wrong, since the laws of probability says there couldn't be two horses this ugly.

However, the filming did not take place in the Lüneburg Heath, but in the area around Worpswede, in the Teufelsmoor and in the Wietingsmoor. The film is also known under the titles \"Dorothee\" (Austria) and \"Rape on the Moor\" (USA).", "She just can't get rid of him: the beautiful Dorothee Aden (Ruth Niehaus) is harassed at every turn by the rude neighboring farmer Dietrich Eschmann (Hermann Schomberg). A real stalker before the word even existed! Mother (Hilde Körber) and father also have no understanding for Dorothee. So it's a good thing that the young architect Ludwig Amelung (very dashing: Armin Dahlen) comes home to the Heidedorf. The two young people soon fall deeply in love with each other. Old Eschmann takes his frustration out on his maid Fiete (Gisela von Collande), who willingly gives herself over to the wild guy. Dorothee is very moved by the story of the heath grave, which was created when the young Wilhelmina was violated by a Swedish soldier during the Thirty Years' War. In revenge for this crime and out of despair at the shame done to her, Wilhelmina lured the unsuspecting rapist to the moor to die there with him. Since then, a rose bush has been growing out of the grave. Things come to a terrible head when Eschmann also rapes the beautiful Dorothee on the heath. Now Dorothee falls more and more under Wilhelmina's spell...", "What an excellent horror story! At the beginning of the 1950s, the German-speaking film industry built on the heyday of horror films (Dr. Caligari) from the Weimar Republic. \"Alraune\" with Hildegard Knef and ACADEMY AWARD nominee Erich von Stroheim was also created in those years. The combination of horror and local films was perfect for drawing attention to the dark sides of country life. This is how the German-language HEIMATFILM / homeland film should have continued! Unfortunately, the more pleasant approach in the spirit of the popular success \"Schwarzwaldmädel\" prevailed. Films like \"ROSEN BLÜHEN AUF DEM HEIDEGRAB / Roses Bloom on the Heidegrab\" were probably too dark for cinema audiences at the time.", "It's even nicer to discover this classic now. Ruth Niehaus (1925-1994) and Armin Dahlen (1919-2013) make a beautiful couple who are able to carry this extremely watchable film."]},

Wieteke van Dort was Titia Konijn, an artistic free spirit, always willing to explain the feminine side of things. However, these three characters were only part of the frame work. All three actors would appear in many different guises each week. Staartjes also had two other recurring characters: confused children's psychologist prof. Dr. Werendfridus Jongerius (whom he later resurrected in another show) and Titia's grandfather who liked to tell stories about the old days and loved to show off his garden.", "Broadcast by the progressive VARA television, sketches and subjects often contained the kind of rude and daring stuff you would feel a bit uneasy watching with your parents, especially since authority figures like them were always perceived as the bad guys.

By 1981 the team once again felt they had covered all the bases and called it quits. But all of them returned in 1988 with the informative 'Klokhuis', this time with a much larger cast (but still including Joost, Aart and Wieteke) and a team of younger presenters to go out and film items on location. This incarnation is still being shown daily on Nederland 3, even though many of the original team have since retired or passed away (more frustrations to write about). ", "8 out of 10"]},

Never the less, the series is definately well worth watching, the acting is spot on the money, even if the story itself is one that most people would rather turn their backs on. The reality is that drug abuse is costing Western Governments billions of dollars, pounds, Euro, and peso's.

As long as we keep turning our backs, then those \"Somebodys\" will keep getting richer.", "As long as this prevails, old people will choose to lock themselves away in their homes for protection.

I strongly recommend that all people should sit and watch this series, not so much for the acting, but for the warning signs, and to open their eyes at what is happening around them in their own communities in America, Europe, Britain, and Australia."]},

Staartjes was presenting a rather notorious IKON children's program at the time that featured stories from the Bible adapted by Karel Eykman. He knew he wanted Wieteke van Dort, formerly of KRO's Oebele to be part of the show and, according to some sources, bumped into Joost Prinsen in the studio cafeteria. Putting these three together proved to be one of those inspired combinations that survives till this day, as they still occasionally share the stage in 'Het Klokhuis' (Stratemaker mark III if you like).", "Staartjes actually borrowed the idiosyncratic concept of a construction-worker at sea from his uncle Dirk, who would often talk about such things and decided to play this part himself. Wieteke clearly relished the opportunity to break out of her good girl image and be ruder and naughtier than she ever was on Oebele. But the break out star of the show was Joost, who was christened 'Erik Engerd' ('Creepy Eric') by writer Jan Riem. Riem then managed to come up with a truckload of gags in no time based on poor Joost's ugly mug. These usually revolved around him failing in his attempts to try and frighten everybody around him with his face and voice. However, these three character were just the starting of point for each episode, in which the three principals portrayed numerous different characters, young and old, male and female in a cavalcade of sketches and songs base on that weeks subject.", "Of course the show wouldn't have become as groundbreaking if it hadn't been for the infamous writers collective that gave this and many other 70s children's program's each distinctive voices. This consisted of the aforementioned Jan Riem, Hans Dorrestijn, Karel Eykman, Ries Moonen & Fetze Pijlman. Add to this Harrie Bannink to put music to their words and you could be sure that each installment of De Stratemaker featured a collection of memorable songs ranging from hilarious to touching (not to mention naughty). Joost Prinsen debuted his insightful song 'Frekie' on De Straat, which became a modest hit single. The original version of the song actually featured him sitting on a stool with a burning cigarette in hand, crooner style. Ah, the seventies! Controversy struck by the time the third episode was broadcast, in which one of the main subjects was 'Pies & Poep'. It says something that even today these two rather childish names for bodily excrement's can't be mentioned on this site uncensored. Gossip journalist Henk van der Meyden denounced immediately the show in his Telegraaf newspaper column, which of course prompted a lot of parents to forbid their offspring to watch it and in turn caused the television ratings to sour sky high.", "Recurring skits included a pair of children (Wieteke & Aart) who seemed to be raising their dad (Joost) instead of the other way round, the King (Aart) who could eat anything he liked (but feared going to the dentist) and the all round expert Professor Piekerbol (Joost) who was always one upped by his dimwitted assistant (Wieteke). The background was usually provided by a series of three multi-functional set pieces which were used to create a wide variety of settings. One particularly innovative move was to have blackboards on one side of several of these pieces, on which forced perspective drawings could be made to create backgrounds (remember, the VARA didn't have much money to spare for what was essentially supposed to be just a summer filler upper). ", "One thing surprising element to me was that Aart, Wieteke & Joost were credited at the end of each episode not as themselves but as their respective characters 'De Stratemaker Op Zee', 'De Deftige Dame' & 'Erik Engert'. No wonder people kept referring to Joost as Engert for years to come. This was also addressed in a song in which Prinsen lamented the fact that no one knew him by his real name. Other than the main three cast members, it was rare to see a guest actor on the show. When Onno Molenkamp appeared in a non-speaking part as Aart Staartjes father (unblinking in a giant close-up during the entire length of a musical number, no less) he naturally remained uncredited. However, they made sure his name was written on the blackboard later on in the episode, surrounded by the names of the other cast members and titles of popular children's program's of the time.", "At one point De Straat started interviewing children to get more insight in their point of view, something that was incorporated to a greater extend in the sequel, 'J.J. de Bom'. Still, by the end of 1974 Staartjes felt that they had run out of subjects to cover and decided to put a sock in it. And, like so many other great series from the seventies, most episodes were wiped clear out of existence to make way for new recordings. Luckily, enough of the songs, skits and bits still remain to make up the two 90 minute compilations I was lucky enough to catch today (also available on DVD since 2008). This means that anyone inclined to catch a slice of early Seventies pedagogy sound edu-tainment can do so and watch De Straat, De Dame & Erik Engerd in their prime. What's more, many thanks to Henk N. Bom of Het Stratemakeropzee Genootschap for providing a list of episodes and air-dates that this contributor plans to put to great use on this very site.", "9 out of 10"]},

His mother died of a snake bite and soon afterwards his father was charged with murder and convicted to death penalty for no fault of his own. After the father is sent to Delhi to await his death sentence, the kid meets a petty thief who confirms that at the time of the murder he saw his father sleeping near his wife's grave. That's when his journey to meet the Indian prime minister of the time, Jawaharlal Nehru and prove his father's innocence begins. And he has many obstacles to overcome.", "Generally a watchable movie telling the story of hope and struggle, Ab Dilli Dur Nahin was a rather experimental film at the time, and the one who fearlessly invested his money in this project was none other than the great Raj Kapoor. This is actually one of the least famous films he produced. The film's title itself, which is more of a slogan, made me go and watch it. Though it is definitely worth the watch, it's not flawless. I liked the beginning a lot, and I found the portrayal of the family and the couple very convincing and moving. This portion of the film shows how people, despite financial difficulties and hardships, were happy with what they had. Unfortunately the death of the female heroine happens too soon and it's a sad view, and the following proceedings only add to the tragedy.", "The film's songs are lovely, but they are so many that at times they just drag the narrative. The director does try to portray the story realistically, but at times the film gets a bit melodramatic and the main conflicts as well as the villains make it look more of a fairy tale. As far as acting is concerned, the film's main protagonist is the kid Master Romi, and he does reasonably well but never well enough. The supporting child actors do much better, for what it's worth. Motilal does very well in his role, while Soluchana Latkar is excellent in her brief appearance. Anwar Hussain makes for an ordinary villain. The film's ending is very sugarcoated and is easy to predict. I thought the movie would have worked better as a children's movie, but it was far too serious. Ab Dilli Dur Nahin may not be a great film, but it has a good concept and it is an altogether appreciable effort."]},

Among his movies were THE FRONT PAGE, A TALE OF TWO CITIES, and BRINGING UP BABY.  He'd usually liven up any film with his wryly comic personality.  Like other character actors such as Franklin Pangborn and Edgar Kennedy, he also starred in comedy short subjects.  The quality of these shorts varied from delightful to dreary.  Unfortunately, \"dreary\" is the appropriate adjective for BLONDES AND BLUNDERS.", "It isn't Catlett's fault.  He conveys a highly amusing characterization of a befuddled, timorous everyman.  His doughy face comically utilizes a variety of reactions and double takes without mugging.  Although Catlett engages in foolish behavior, he always maintains a likable Milquetoast demeanor.", "Catlett is supported by a good cast, including Ann Doran, Matt McHugh, Marion Martin, and Richard Fiske.  They are seasoned pros who can effortlessly handle comedy.  Unfortunately, there is little comedy in this short.", "The premise is promising: A pair of crooks (Martin and Fiske) hide a diamond in the innocent Catlett's clothes.  Catlett's wife Doran thinks the diamond is a present for her.  Then the crooks try to get the diamond back. Throughout the short, the actors run around, hide in various places, exchange insults, and get into perilous situations.  But they hardly do anything funny.  Gags are scarce and those few gags are generally too sadistic to be funny. (Example: the crooks step on Catlett's hands and he bites one of them in retaliation.)  BLONDES AND BLUNDERS also suffers from a rushed and unresolved ending.", "The short's humorlessness is astonishing, since the director, Del Lord, was highly adept in slapstick.  BLONDES AND BLUNDERS proves that Lord, like all filmmakers, was fallible.  It also proves that even during the Golden Age of Hollywood, bad comedies existed."]},

At the beginning the events happen at a theater where appears the impulsive son of Edmond's nasty enemy , asking a deadly duel . From now on , a long flashback develops the happenings about the famous Count of Montecristo who's betrayed by his friends , the count Montego and others , as the astute General prosecutor . He's framed as sender of Napoleon's letters who's jailed in island of Elba . Then he's punished to life imprison in island of If where he finds a lot of suffering . Dantes is imprisoned on the island prison of Château d'If for 18 years, where he plots revenge against those who betrayed him . While imprisoned, he meets the Abbe Faria , a fellow prisoner whom everyone believes to be mad. The Abbe tells Edmond of a fantastic treasure hidden away on a tiny island, that only he knows the location . Edmond spends years unjustly at the Château-prison but he escapes and gets the treasure of Montecristo . He proceeds to transform himself into the wealthy Count of MonteCristo as part of his plan to carry out a relentless vendette against his enemies . The revenge is ready against the nasty traitors who accused him.", "This is a fine and enjoyable remake of the Alexander Dumas tale by the same name . In the film there are adventures , a love story , derring-do and results to be a decent story . Agreeable and attractive rendition based on the famous novel with emotional highs and lows , in which Edmond Dantes is unjustly sent to prison for 18 years , and with the help of another prisoner he escapes to reclaim his fiancée and to exact his merciless revenge . Although uneven and paced in fits and starts , it is neither tiring , nor boring but entertaining .

It's an interesting mix; some stolen moments of hotel guests interacting, often filled with real dialogue that could be right out of one of Bennett's witty, and affectionately satirical pieces about people from all of Britain's various walks of life. But the piece is dominated by Bennett himself, musing to camera on the boyhood memories that are brought back by the various sights, sounds and characters at the hotel.

It's on the second day (Dooj) only when people are able to see the moon which is a very slender shape. ", "This second day coming after Diwali as well as Holi is considered as Bhaiya-Dooj in several parts of India which is a great festival of brothers and sisters. On this day the sisters put a Tilak on the foreheads of their brothers and perform Aarti for them. And the brothers take vows to protect and support the sisters wholeheartedly whenever needed. We can call it a mini Rakshabandhan which is an emotional festival, especially for the sisters who eagerly wait for their brothers on this day. The movie under review refers to this Dooj only whose auspicious sign is Dooj Ka Chaand, i.e., the slender moon visible on this night. The base of the very interesting story of this movie is the bro-sis love only.", "Dooj Ka Chaand is the story of Gopu (Bhaarat Bhooshan) who lives with his elder brother, Mahendra (Chandrashekhar) and sister-in-law, i.e., Bhabhi (Sulochana). Their parents are no more and Gopu's Bhabhi is also issueless. But these two brothers have a sister, Lalita (Jeevankala) who is actually the adopted daughter of their parents. Gopu is a carefree youth in his life not giving a damn for career and living. More than his studies, he takes interest in doing theatre. His Bhabhi loves him very much and always becomes a shelter for him from the resentment of Mahendra. Further, he loves his younger sister, Lalita very much and wants a suitable boy for her. Lalita also loves her fosters brothers very much, especially Gopu. One more track of this story is the friendship of Gopu with Anand (Ashok Kumar) who has become a lawyer after facing a lot of hardships in his life. Gopu has always helped him in his hour of need.", "Due to his carelessness in life, Gopu has to suffer a heartbreak when his sweetheart, Indira (Azra) is married to the public prosecutor in the city court (Iftekhar). Gopu has to leave his home also when his sister, Lalita's engagement is broken. His fate makes him cross paths with Gauri (B. Saroja Devi) who starts loving him. On the other hand, Anand happens to meet Leela (Preeti Baala) who is the daughter of a big barrister (Ulhaas). Anand not only starts his legal practice successfully under Leela's father but also gets married to her.", "The twist in the tale comes when Gopu comes to know about Lalita's marriage with a rich but licentious aged person, Meeraasdaar (Muraad). He is awestruck to see that his sister's life is going to be spoilt this way. The reason behind this marriage is conveyed to him as the money owed by his family to Meeraasdaar. Gopu promises Meeraasdaar to repay his debt and leaves no stone unturned in arranging money for that with the help of Gauri. Still he could not stop Lalita's marriage with Meeraasdaar. But on the wedding night itself, Meeraasdaar is murdered and Gopu is arrested for his murder. In his trial, his ex-flame's husband is the public prosecutor whereas his close friend, Anand is the defence counsel for him. The real murderer is unmasked in the end and Gopu is acquitted.", "This story has been written by K.P. Kottarakara with a lot of effort which deserves admiration. Though director, Nitin Bose could not direct this admirable script perfectly for the screen, nevertheless the movie is engrossing for the viewer.

Typically the character will perform outrageous stunt performer / daredevil stunts which often go disastrously awry resulting in the appearance of grievous bodily injury. These include such mishaps as being knocked off the top of the CN Tower, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, after determining it was too windy to do a cabled jump or being run over by a steamroller after failing to escape from a locked trunk. After such a mishap, Super Dave would usually appear torn apart, stretched, or otherwise grievously injured. Although Super Dave initially exhibited and was injured during wild stunts, in later appearances, he would often be injured in mishaps involving much more mundane events during which danger was not anticipated. His signature logo, a drawing of his head inside a crash helmet directly atop a pair of crushed silver boots with no visible body, was from an iconic early sketch, \"Balloon Ball\", a \"stunt\" which consisted of his standing in a hole in the ground reciting \"balloon ball\" as a mantra which was supposed to imbue him with the ability to not be harmed by anything, as a mobile pile driver rammed the top of his helmeted head multiple times. When pulled out of the hole, he was as his eventual logo depicted: his helmeted head sitting directly inside the crash helmet atop his smashed silver boots, the whole of his body supposedly compressed down between boots and neck.", "Super Dave is often accompanied on his various exploits by a loyal friend, sidekick, and assistant stunt coordinator Fuji Hakayito (comedian Art Irizawa), and his segments are introduced and commentated on by former sportscaster/actor Mike Walden. Fuji typically initiates whatever stunt Dave is performing. Super Dave runs the fictional \"Super Dave Compound\", a combination resort, theme park, learning center, and anything else needed for the plot-line of any particular episode. Many of his misadventures have been based on demonstrating various aspects of the compound. Another characteristic was the utterance of the phrase \"Holy Chim\" (a bowdlerized version of \"holy shit\"), usually when the stunt was ongoing and he realized he was in over his head, notably his barefoot fire-walker stunt. When reflecting on the failed stunt, Super Dave would, in annoyance, call Walden a number of Yiddish names.", "Trademark components of the Super Dave character include his frequent thumbs-ups and his many jump suit uniforms - most of which include red, white and blue, yellow stars, and stripes - which are reminiscent of those worn by daredevil [[Evel Knievel]]. It was often specified Osborne's safety harnesses or seatbelts were made of \"genuine [[Saskatchewan]] [[sealskin]] bindings\". Seals are not indigenous to the landlocked province of Saskatchewan, and are therefore part of the comedic juxtaposition predicated on the eventual failure of the stunt by being both \"genuine sealskin\" and from Saskatchewan."]},

The fact that Robert Kerman plays the good doctor gives you a notion of the tenor of this film, given that when not doing what comes naturally for a living RK is usually to be found in an Italian gore movie about mistreating animals.", "Always-reliable Marlene Willougby plays Mrs. Erica Feinberg, who has an interest in \"big dogs\". Once the sniggering laughs die down about this obvious bestiality reference, it turns out that she is actually the militant leader of an animal rights cult which instead of throwing paint on women modeling furs at fashion shows is dognapping animals all over the Big Apple to prevent them being neutered. (Yeah, I know that neutering/spaying is really good for the overall pet population as a whole, but in pornworld terms nothing could be worse for an individual than castration.) Jamie Gillis pops up annoyingly as a seedy cop with rape on his mind. The film is so sloppy that later on he returns for an extraneous sex scene, which narration calmly writes off as \"he's off duty\".", "The film is filled with lots & lots of humans humping while the dogs watch from their cages. Thank god there is no bestiality whatsoever, although I suspect that was a \"nudge, nudge\" marketing ploy when this film was made.", "The sex filler here is pretty random: Vanessa Del Rio bandaging an injured boy en route to giving him a b.j.; Serena and Kerman engaging in phone sex; and the usual orgy action. Finale has Serena put into a very tiny cage where she's forced to give b.j.'s through the bars. Coda is weird: Serena doing end titles in her diary and a singer coming on screen to sing \"Kitty's Ballad\".", "This farrago is credited to the anonymous Jason Tarone, whose work is several notches below the famous list of Gotham helmers of the '70s. The film is recommended only to people who like to see a bad gimmick milked for all it isn't worth."]},

When he finally relents and lets the boy go, we launch into a long chronicle of Alan's preparations. First it's back to the house, where his mom gives him a lecture about not helping his father, then there's a long scene of him wandering down a road, where he's interrupted by a couple of cops who *also* give him a lecture about going fishing without permission (Alan insists his dad said yes and his mom said no, which the deputies decide makes it all right). Along the way, Alan's sister is hanging laundry on the clothesline and ends up assaulted by the convict, which, in typical '70s fashion, she quickly comes around to. Alan had finally settled down for his fishing adventure around the half-hour mark, which is where I turned this thing off. Life is just too damn short."]},

A girl scout selling cookies door to door leads Betsy to a surefire way of escaping the unwanted attentions of O'Malley and police lieutenant Fawcett (John Leslie), a master of disguise brought in to trap the hookers, by offering her sexual favors in a similar way ! Her first customer is kinky Lothario Ashley Moore who keeps his wife chained to one of those Medieval contraptions initially devised for the public flogging of criminals. \"She likes to hang out every Wednesday,\" he quips.

Not that there's just stuff to listen to and nothing to see, mind you. ", "Sync (a good actress who delivered a career performance in Roberta Findlay's all time showstopper THE TIFFANY MINX) turns up the heat full blast in her jail cell scene with Leslie and Costello, even performing the still rarely attempted double vaginal penetration at one point. An interesting stylistic device occurs at the beginning of this sequence when Costello uses a swinging light bulb to set the mood, a simple touch that had already proved its effectiveness in his PASSIONS OF CAROL, which he had directed as \"Amanda Barton\" two years prior.

The SWV liners trumpet how these segments stick out like sore thumbs, but honestly, nudist films tend to turn into such numbing slogs it was hard for me to tell. My mind had already been shut down by the endless, soporific narration, huffing lugubriously through the film's shopworn plot: model comes to Florida for a shoot, meets a handsome (at least to her) guy at a horse stable, discovers he's a nudist, and gets inducted into the lifestyle by wandering around a camp ad nauseum.

Still, even the presence of some (actually way more than \"some\") genuine, honest-to-god frontal nudity (both sexes) can't elevate the form. There's a bit of eye candy for everyone, but if you're looking for any type of entertainment, you're sorely out of luck. By 1968, the exploitation racket had already moved well beyond the nudist camp and was cycling through increasingly graphic iterations of softcore humping, biding its time as it waited for hardcore to finally make its bow. In that regard, GIRLS is a relic out of time, built from a film already necessitating an update a mere 5 years after its release, yet still woefully behind the times. As an inadvertent snapshot of a period of lightning-fast transition in the American sex film industry, it perhaps merits a modicum of interest; unfortunately, like most fossils, it's pretty dry and dusty."]},

They have similar physiques and earthy beauty, so it's not surprising both became my all-time favorites. In the VHS era it was fairly common to create new releases by adding a new scene to an already released feature several years later, and several \"Viviana\" movies were made this way. She is a legendary performer in my book, but other than a handful of fine videos (such as \"Hot on Her Trail\", \"Spanish Rose\" and \"Hard to Thrill\"), she was underappreciated by pornographers at the time, merely a lure to get fans (like me) to shell out.

Both the \"prologue\" and the first sequence are shot practically without editing, and they destroy whatever mood the following pic might have striven to achieve. The rest is a somewhat confusing crime mystery without being particularly interesting. The action is accompanied bye a comical-illustrative bassoon theme, which really began to work on my nerves from the very beginning. The two leading ladies are very pretty, but they look so much alike it's sometimes difficult to understand who is doing what - especially since one of them is supposed to be a bit evil, the other not.

What is good in this particular film is mostly due to the merry and spirited singer Georg \"Jori\" Malmstén who plays the main role and performs his (still) rather popular songs. Malmstén actually steals the movie for himself from being just a propaganda film, and with his songs the whole movie becomes a rather good musical too.", "In many other propaganda films the nature of the enemy becomes very clear, but in 'Our Boys At The Sea' too direct references to any particular enemy are completely missing; the enemy doesn't need to be the Soviet Union this time.

The Pope entrusts the Polo family with a trade mission to China and with a personal message of peace for China's Emperor Kublai Khan. Unknown to all of them is the fact that the peaceful Kublai Khan is facing a treasonous dissension among his Mongol war chieftains, led by his war-loving son. His son wants the throne for himself and desires to destroy all Chinese subjects, in favor of his Mongol ones. He also wants to invade Europe and avail himself of slaves, territory and spoils of war. In Venice, the Polos board a ship for the Holly Lands, presently occupied by the Crusaders. From there, they are to proceed by caravan, overland, to Samarkand and eventually reach Peking. However, the overland route passes through several kingdoms, caliphates and wild rugged regions inhabited by unwelcoming warlike tribes. The route also presents other dangers, such as bandits, assassins, murderous religious sects and natural perils such as sand storms and rough terrain. At some point, Marco splits from the caravan and takes a different path, shorter but more perilous, while his father Niccolò and his uncle Matteo continue on the traditional caravan route, that is longer but safer. They all pledge to meet in Samarkand. Marco has his share of dangerous adventures while his father and uncle run into trouble of their own. Often times, it seems that their mission is about to fail and looks like none will reach China alive. However, the Pope's faith in his envoys' ability to overcome adversity and peril is justified and their mission seems protected by a higher power.", "The young Marco Polo, after the recommendations and wise advice of Elder Akerman, leaves for China to help Kublai Khan in the fight against the rebels, led by his son, with a new invention: gunpowder (translation of the Italian-language plot summary)."]},

Though he accepted the royal pension later in his life, he always remained carefree in his life and the economic hardships never took their toll on this legendary Shaayar. He never bothered about his future and enjoyed every moment of his life.", "Producer-director Sohrab Modi made a movie on the youth phase of his life. Great Hindi author- Saadat Hasan Manto wrote the story, another great Hindi writer - Rajinder Singh Bedi wrote the screenplay and J.K. Nanda wrote the Urdu-laden dialogues.", "The story of Mirza Ghalib (1954) is nothing but the love-affair of Mirza Ghalib (Bhaarat Bhushan) and Mothi Begum (Suraiya). Mirza Ghalib (real name Asadullah Khan) is already married to Umrao Begum (Nigaar Sultaana) but falls into love with a courtesan whose real name is Mothi Begum or the pearl queen but she likes to be called as Chaudahvin Begum or the fourteenth queen. Amidst the hardships and the ups and downs in Ghalib's life, their love story continues until Mothi Begum feels that she is destroying Ghalib's marital life and commits suicide.", "The way there is no mention of Anarkali in the history but the Salim-Anarkali saga is immortal for the lovers and the creators of fictional-work, the same way there is no mention of Mothi Begum in the history or the biography of Mirza Asdullah Khan Ghalib but the authors have taken their liberty in creating her to make a touching love story. I don't know whether it is true or not but the thing widely acknowledged is that every great male artist is bound to have relationship with some female who acts as his muse. The major part of the movie has been dedicated to the introduction, meetings and love of Mirza Ghalib and Mothi Begum. The rest has been dedicated to Mirza's family life, his hardships due to poverty, his popularity through Shaayari and the helplessness of the Mughal emperor in doing anything worthwhile due to the increasing might of the British. Sohrab Modi has superbly directed the story drafted for him by the great Hindi litterateurs.", "The scene of the visit of the Hindu money-lender (Mukri) to Mirza's home is very impressive in which Lala or the money-lender asks for his due money and Mirza offers to give his Shaayari to him just like paper-waste but Mirza's wife stops him and offers Lala to take her golden bangles against the money due to him but then the kind-hearted and sensitive Lala himself refuses to take her bangles and leaves Mirza's residence saying to Mirza that he is not in a hurry for his money and if Mirza requires further money, he can approach him. Despite being an imaginary incident, It underscores the communal harmony in our country as well as the human-bonds between people in that period .", "The arrest of Mirza by the police officer of that area (Ulhas) and the judge's himself giving Mirza's bail money (because he is also Mirza's admirer) is another impressive scene. Murad has played the role of the judge. The helplessness of the Mughal emperor (Iftekhar) has also been shown emphatically when he says to Mothi Begum (who approaches him for Mirza's release) that he cannot do anything to ensure Mirza's release from jail because his order is not applicable on the other side of the Yamuna where the order of the British resident holds good.", "Finally, the movie scores because of the immortal Ghazals and Nazms of the legendary Shaayar sung by Suraiya and Talat Mahmood and composed by Ghulam Mohammed. The music of this movie is nothing short of a precious jewel, a great combination of Urdu poetry and touching melodies. Aah Ko Chaahiye Ek Umr Asar Hone Tak, Yeh Na Thi Hamaari Kismat Ki Visaal-e-Yaar Hota, Nuktacheen Hai Gham-e-Dil, Dil-e-Naadan Tujhe Hua Kya Hai, Ishq Mujhko Nahin Vehashat Hi Sahi etc. are the musical gems to be preserved forever. The male voice songs are a part of Talat Mahmood's all time great songs (solos and duets). One song - Hai Bas Ke Har Ek Unke Ishaare Mein has been sung by Mohammed Rafi.", "Suraiya was as beautiful as well as a proficient actress as a great singer she was. In all the three forms of art, she was unmatchable. She has infused life into the role of the sacrificing Mothi Begum and in a way, overshadowed the hero. Her performance both as a singer as well as an actress for the Ghazal - Aah Ko Chaahiye Ek Umr Asar Hone Tak is unforgettable. Again in the climax, she has mesmerized the viewers-cum-listeners on the immortal Ghazal - Yeh Na Thi Hamaari Kismat Ki Visaal-e-Yaar Hota. Bhaarat Bhushan was always effective in performing the sensitive and golden-hearted characters of artists and he has done well in the title role. Nigaar Sultaana as Mirza's wife has marvelled like anything. The complete supporting cast has done justice to the respective roles.", "Technically, the movie is highly admirable. It's a period movie and hence special care was required in its making. The art director - Rusi K. Banker had won the Filmfare award for the best art direction for this movie. He has virtually brought the Delhi of the nineteenth century on the screen. Cinematography of this black and white movie is equally effective.

Monstrosity concerns a group of young men, one of whom's girlfriend has been brutally raped and beaten and THEN killed by the same assailant in her hospital room (making for a crazy, distasteful, ultra-violent first 20 minutes).

For one thing, no one seems to use their \"wits\" about anything and, for all you know, no one has any wits in the first place because there are TV commercials with better character development than what you see on display in this mess. It starts out with a wounded girl being carried back to \"camp\", but they don't show her getting wounded and they don't really explain how she got wounded. It's a just a leg wound, and she isn't bleeding heavily, but she lays there like she's paralyzed for the entire flick for no good reason, while this creepy vet makes sexual advances on her. Then, some other guy gets killed, but they don't bother to show that happening, either. And then another one gets killed and injured, and they don't really show that and then another one gets injured, and they don't show much of that. There isn't really a battle of wits or even a cat and mouse game--the good guys just wander around like idiots, unarmed, getting picked off one at a time until the one guy who has a handgun starts screaming and yelling like a moron and is promptly shot in the back within seconds. The ending is a total bummer, but I won't give it away.", "So, unless you are partially brain dead, a couple questions might come to mind as you watch it. Why would a bunch of kids training for a paintball competition need a bunch of grown Vietnam vets (in uniforms, no less!) to train them and why would the vets even care enough to do it in the first place? Why would they be able to just waltz into this hot spot full of criminals (that just happens to have a cabin they can use), if the government is aware of the problem and even has agents actively pursuing the crooks? Wouldn't they have blocked off the area? And why wouldn't they have more than one radio that can transmit? Because the guy says they are \"expensive\"? Seriously?!?!?", "The only thing I can think of that would cause a movie to roll out the way this one does is if they lost some of the footage or just couldn't afford to keep filming and decided to release it as-is. Any way you slice it, the flick would be B-movie crap, but there are some critical scenes missing that would have made the film make a lot more sense and, as I mentioned, character development is just about nil. The dialogue is atrocious and is made more so by the all-around lack of acting ability of every single character. This movie is really bad, make no mistake, but I give it two stars because I delight in watching awful action flicks, but this one really goes over the top. It isn't so bad it's good--it's like a wreck where you can't look away and, if you don't have a thing for bad movies, you'll absolutely hate it. It's a righteous stinker and you've been warned!"]},

Moon And Midnight was one and this is another. Seemingly low budget yet still able to secure the services of Anna Karina and Jean Rochefort this is described as 'sci-fi tinged'. Maybe, but pretentious would be another apt description. Strangely, having just watched The Lickerish Quartet, this is another film with a found film within that seems to foretell what other participants in the film will partake of. The main problem is that there is no attempt to involve the viewer, other than with repeated imagery, which can end up being more alienating. never mind the appalling soundtrack that crashes all about.", "Worth watching only for the lovely Anna Karina and veteran actor, Jean Rochefort in one of his earlier films. I can't imagine either actor got paid for this - strange year 1970 worldwide but in France in particular. We can probably blame the student uprising of a couple of years previous."]},

One girl has an ax planted in her head, another one is sliced up naked in her bed, and the third one gets stabbed in the back by a guy dressed up as an old lady. The killer gets apprehended, but none of these events are ever brought up again throughout the entire film; - very weird. Not that it gets any better, though. Quite the contrary, \"Victims!\" looks like a typical 80s slasher, but in fact it's more of an overdue and insignificant rape & revenge thriller (like they made many in the 70s). Four free-spirited and deliberately provocative teen girls head out for a weekend in the desert mountains, supposedly for a school project but naturally they are more occupied with parading half-naked in front of gas station attendants and skinny dipping.

It's about a group of adventurous kibbutz kids who function in solidarity as a mutually supportive unit. The one who has a parent visible in the film is an oddity. The photography is excellent, and the choice of settings works very well. For the most part, the kids' limited acting ability doesn't matter much. We get to see a nice turn from the legendary Bomba Tzur, who appeared in all too few movies. A bigger role goes to the even more legendary Shaike Ophir, but he doesn't find much to sink his teeth into."]},

When I ran into the animated show \"Battletech\" I got hooked as this series had giant mecha, I honestly mistaken it for a sequel to \"Macross\" because of this along with the title but of course it wasn't. Though the \"Mechwarrior/Battletech\" franchise was inspired by that anime series and others that had giant mecha.", "\"Battletech\" of course is based on an RPG franchise which in the 90's became a heavy stomping phenomenon. I remember one of my friends in middle school was into the game as he had one of the RPG manuals. This franchise was popular enough to produce some video games for the PC and consoles. A licensed book series which was cool. And of course, from how popular the franchise go eventually an animated show was bound to happen.", "I really like the animation as it' s pritty much the kind you'd see from the 90's but that what makes it even more top notch as I honestly wouldn't want it any other way. I just like how well detail in both backgrounds and character models, it really felt that they put care into what they do in capturing the essence of the RPG franchise.", "One of the things that made this show stand out was in the sequences where they used CGI animation. You must realize this show was in the 90's and CGI animation was a novelty concept that we were starting to utilize and cultivate. I still thing the CGI sequences in the show look good at least on a retro perspective, you must admire the effort they put into them.", "I really like how the mechs are well detailed, just looking at them I wanted to drive one of those, my favorite one is the axe man as that mech seems to be one of the strongest and well balanced, let alone you have a good weapon for melee combat. But I also like the combat which is well choreographed. The mech warfare is a little different as opposed to what you'd see in anime which are always flighty battles. It's more like an advanced version of tank warfare or medevil combat and I like that as it's something different but also it feels like the combat has some actual weight as there is some strategy and tactics involved. Really like the sounds of the lasers which are just cool, just music to my ears.", "One of the other things that make this show unique is that this isn't a war between good and evil but a civil war as it's more a conflict of opposing ideologies. We can see both sides, at first, we think the Clans might be in the wrong but then due to some things you discover about them, I'll admit I started to wonder if I was wrong as some of their ideology isn't entirely wrong. But also, the Star League despite our preconceived notions that they're the good guys, we don't really know them all very well as each of the members were from different factions and also each aren't exactly close friends with each other and may have agendas of their own; from this we're not sure how long the alliance will hold.", "I even like how the warfare went were sometimes the home team the Star League didn't always win; seeing this shows the reality of warfare how it's not a one-sided affair; nor is it a game because when you lose it's bad and the outcome can affect things significantly. Even like how the show really dealt with the grayness of this intergalactic civil war, which shows another reality on how things aren't always or never were black or white. Sometimes there are no good guys or bad guys but just sides with different perspectives and ideologies, and when those things are in conflict it depends on what you believe and which side of the fence you want to stay on and fight for.", "Only misfires are one the show is a little confusing in places. It's understandable as the RPG series has loads of content which means to some that are familiar with the tabletop game series there might be some things that are missing. And people that are unfamiliar with it may feel as though they missed a season of the show as a lot happened before. You have to understand this was the first season which makes it an introductory season, which means they can only slowly unload a certain amount of content from the property.", "And of course, this leads to the second misfire is simply this didn't have another season as it all ends on sort of a cliffhanger note. I'll admit this really disappointed me as I personally was looking forward to it. Probably the other season would've been the Star League and Clan war goes on but things get more complicated as there are other factions that emerge like the Wolf and Dragon clan from the game. We would probably see some new character that either join the Star League or don't, new mechs, and of course new dramatic dilemmas that will affect the war and everyone in it. I don't know, only in the realm of fanfiction do we have this new season.", "It would be awesome to have a revival, another animated series but we can have it for a more mature audience. Or better yet even a live action show made with top notch quality production and on the right premium channel and make damn sure the property is in the right hands. I'm not sure how the story would go, it would have to be multi focused where it's not just about one faction but others, each season would be a story arc based on a campaign which would be true to the RPG series as each game is based on a single campaign, would like to see the other planets like in the games, have developing dynamics and relationships which serve both the characters and story, other mechs mainly the recent ones that were never in the first show. Last requests have a reprint and rerelease of the licensed book series and some new volumes which can continue off from it, as well as a licensed comic book series. I know all request long shots but all the same each of these things are a nice thought, and with the franchise now reactivated why not.", "If you're an RPG fan and familiar with the \"Mechwarrior/Battletech\" franchise, then this is a piece of history worth looking at. Or if your just into vintage animated shows and are deeply into the sci-fi genre, then this show like any good automated mech is worth a test drive.", "\"Battletech\" is a mechanized marvelous blast.", "Rating: 3 stars."]},

And he had over 500 ties - all of them atrocious. The only person on TV with the character to wear clothes that bad is Richie Benaud (the cricket commentator). If you are American or Martian and have never caught a period of Richie's commentary you are missing out on a beautiful thing, but i digress... The thing about Whiteley is that you knew what he was.....he didn't pretend to be cool and as a result people grew to love him. compare this to modern stars who start out attractive but get uglier the more you know about them..... 2/ Carol Vorderman is perfectly cast as Whiteley's sidekick. There is no substitute for good casting. 3/ The show cost less than 15000pounds per episode to shoot, and still did huge numbers. You can't beat that. 4/ In an era where game shows are built around greed or cruelty, Countdown offered no great prizes and actually made you think.

Although not listed in the credits, this viewer remembers that Spike's long time vocal associate Doodles Weaver, who was also a fine actor, appeared from time to time on the show.", "One feature that made Spike's performances stand out was that he and his City Slickers were all exceptional musicians. Spike was a virtuoso on the drums but also played a mean Smith & Wesson. Today Spike is still one of the most requested songsters on the syndicated Dr. Demento radio program out of Culver City, California. The fun lives on."]},

Thankfully this brutal and harsh thinking comes to an end with a positive climax and happy ending and Basant ends of fulfilling note.

He was an art teacher to the monumentally influential Art Spiegelman and is sometimes credited for coining the term \"paracinema\" – though that changes depending on your source. Whether he invented the term or not, paracinema seems to be the wheelhouse in which Jacobs lives. It is a word that literally stands for any type of film that is outside the conventional genres in filmmaking. In Jacobs' personal favorite genre, experimental avant-garde, paracinema also means any film made without the standard equipment of the film medium. If this essay-like opening paragraph is boring you, I guarantee the subject matter of Ken Jacobs' 1963 Blonde Cobra will lighten the mood.", "I almost feel strange referring to Blonde Cobra as an actual movie as opposed to a home video of two perverts talking about penises. See, I told you it would pick-up. It is set in a cramped apartment and shot with a single camera in grainy and unpleasant looking black and white. It \"stars\" a fellow experimental filmmaker, Jack Smith (Flaming Creatures), as himself in silly costumes while holding icky looking props. The motives for the movie are almost impossible to figure out. If I had to guess, I would say that these are two bored, eccentric homosexual filmmakers in the early 60s who are doing nothing more than looking for a way to torment the suits. There does not seem to be a point to anything in the film, rather Jacobs fills the half an hour runtime with controversial and offensive voiceovers behind strange images or completely blank screens.", "There is no secular narrative presented in the film. Instead, Jacobs split his work into three short vignettes featuring Smith as different characters usually in drag or some other goofy costume. The first short in the film has Smith dressed in the manner of a fortuneteller and displays the behavior of someone with an intense oral fixation. This dialogue-less action includes Smith licking raw poultry and features a voice-over that describes cases of sexual molestation to children and necrophilia. The best I can do is say I THINK that is what they're talking about, but it is almost impossible to understand what they are saying. Most of these stories, including one particular moment in which Smith describes a female's use of religious statues for masturbation, are said over a blank, black screen. You'd think that a visual break from the action would be kinda nice, but the narration might even be more graphic. It is certainly more offensive.", "The next \"scene\" has Smith and another man dressed as 1920s-esque gangsters as they dance to what sounds like (but don't quote me on it) the Ginger Rodgers and Fred Astaire version of \"Let's Call the Whole Thing Off\". I would think that this scene holds the key to Blonde Cobra even being on this list of films. Pop music in film was a brand new concept in the 1960s. And though many credit The Graduate for the use of a pop music soundtrack, Jacobs and Smith were using recordings in their films as early as 1957. Jacobs'Blonde Cobra, Smith's Flaming Creatures and, of course, Anger's Scorpio Rising were all released between 1963-64 and unknowingly serve as the first examples of unlicensed music in film.", "And then, after all of that excitement, there is another vignette. This time we have Smith dressed as an explorer of some kind. He and another man rub themselves on all sorts of different apartment props. Smith can be heard saying that sex is \"a pain in the ass\". Other than that, nothing really happens.", "Maybe the most famous line in the film is said in the first act. Mid-sentence, Smith stops and turns to the camera. With a completely serious demeanor you can hear him say – \"I don't know if this makes sense to you\". I can assure you that the film does not make any sense at all. Not in the way that a surrealist like Buñuel doesn't make sense, but more in the way that a sleep deprived, gay crack-addict probably doesn't make sense. I eventually came to realize that looking for a motive or a point in Blonde Cobra is an exercise in futility. The film is pointless.", "It would be wrong to say that Blonde Cobra has absolutely no cultural importance. Jacobs and Smith are both very famous in the gay, New York underground film scene. Somebody somewhere likes this stuff. And like Tarantino makes movies for a niche of people – these men made their films for a much smaller sample of the same thing. If you are not part of the particular audience – Blonde Cobra will mean nothing to you. Honestly, it's a piece of crap."]},

There will also be several gang-bang scenes and no-one takes their time about getting nekkid. It's all pretty much hi how are ya why haven't you got your tits out yet and before anyone draws their second breath the chick is sucking cock. The acting is solid wood (well that's why you watch porn, right?) ;-) the locations are - well, odd, and the costumes very low budget; but all that makes it sound like this is a terrible movie and it isn't. As adult films go, it's really not that bad, and I've seen a lot worse. The sex is all pretty solid and un-faked (no Viagra!) with the men all decently erect and properly aroused (and they are not the muscle-bound gorillas that seem to be dominating porn nowadays, but average) - and there a couple of pretty well-hung dudes amongst them, I might add; the girls as I have mentioned are not bad looking and look like they are having fun at least. Couple of very nice butts here.", "I do have a minor issue with the way the script kinda assumes that all females are basically just panting to screw a guy - any guy, any time, any where, and the more the merrier - but I guess that's all part of the porn film fantasy, right? Basically the exact reverse of reality, where a girl needs a reason to have sex, a guy just needs a place? :-) So what we have here is nearly 2 and a half hours of solid hard-core that would give modern website porn a good run for its money. If you're into hairy, and would like your porn to have more than zero plot line, find (the Englsh version of) this film and settle back with your favourite toy and a bottle of... beer? Lube? And enjoy. :-D"]},

Anderson would bring him coffee, and they'd smoke cigarettes and chat. And one day Hall asked him what he wanted to do with his life. \"Write movies,\" Anderson told him. \"Incidentally, I've written a twenty-eight-minute minidrama, and there's a good part in it for you. If you're interested, maybe I can borrow some equipment and we can shoot it.\" Not long after, Hall received a script called \"Cigarettes and Coffee\". The main plotline was about a young gambler who thinks his wife is having an affair, so he goes to an older gambler and asks for advice. It had a lot of clever twists and turns and some serendipitous crossovers that were similar to the opening of ", ", connecting multiple story lines through a twenty-dollar bill. But the most impressive thing was the writing. It wasn't just good, Hall says, it was dazzling. The gangly little kid who delivered his coffee had written something great. \"I was wondering, Who was the first actor in the 17th century to see a Shakespeare script, and did he know what he was reading? I certainly knew what I had in my hand.\" ", " [a friend] had some connections at Panavision, so Anderson asked him if he could borrow a Panaflex camera for one weekend - a $6,000 rental to civilians. Conrad's friend said they could borrow it if they returned it on Monday morning. \"I remember going to Kodak with Paul to buy the film,\" Conrad says. \"He had researched exactly what kind of tungsten he wanted.\" Then he tapped his network to fill out the cast with more professional actors - ", " (\"Twin Peaks\"), ", " (\"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\"), ", " (\"Reservoir Dogs\") [, ", " (\"Midnight Run\")]. The legend is that he financed the shoot with his NYU tuition, but Conrad says Ernie [Anderson's father] put in a couple thousand and he put in a couple hundred and they got some more from ", " [Anderson's girlfriend]. They slipped onto the Disney lot to hit up the mother of one of the Freshjive guys for a donation, and she cut them a $500 check on the spot. Conrad handled the money. \"I'm not sure Paul even had a checking account, so I was writing checks for the film-production expenses.\" The father of one of Conrad's friends helped arrange a stay in Las Vegas so they could spend a day shooting on the Strip. Anderson hired a professional cinematographer and rented a Fisher dolly, and Conrad found a camera operator, and they loaded all the equipment into the back of his Bronco and drove to the cheap diner Weidman had rented in the Gorman Pass. Things were a bit chaotic at first, Hall says. The crew hadn't worked together before, there wasn't a strong producer or cinematographer running the show, and Anderson still had a lot to learn about working with real actors. \"Miguel and I were not sure where we were or how we got there. We talked a couple of times, not exactly, Who is this kid?, but we weren't sure what was going on.\" Anderson was about twenty-three then, still very young for a director. But he was assured where it counted. He had a very clear vision of his characters. He knew what he wanted from a scene. He understood all the technical details. He knew what to expect from every member of the crew, even knew enough to challenge their expertise. He didn't even have to do a lot of takes. \"He seemed to have an almost instinctive knowledge about this kind of stuff,\" Hall says. And he had a laser intensity with actors. \"A lot of directors shoot from the monitor, or even from another room. He will get as close as he can, just out of camera range. Sometimes just inches away. At first I found it a little distracting - he's always right there, with such intensity.

The song was actually written for ", " in 1986.", "Featured in ", " (2018)", "This was PT Anderson's first film, made when he was just 17, it's shot on video and was edited together on two VCRs. This is just an amazing film, shot as a documentary on the rise and fall of porn star Dirk Diggler, covering his career through the late 70s and into the 80s, featuring excellent deadpan narration. All of which was later re-written and expanded on for his second full-length film, Boogie Nights. The film features lots of on set footage as we watch Dirk in action during filming; this is interspersed with interview footage with his friends and fellow porn stars. Some of the major characters that would feature in Boogie Nights are already here, including Reed Rothchild, Dirks best friend and sidekick in their films, here played by a huge bodybuilder, with an amazing mullet haircut. Also present is director Jack Horner, here played by Robert Ridgley, who was in Boogie Nights playing the Colonel, he turns in a great world weary performance as Dirk's mentor, never once taking off his massive shades, his performance is excellent and he's easily the best in the film. Dirk himself is played by Mike Stein, a good friend of Andersons, who plays Dirk perfectly, with long flowing dark hair and a slim muscular physique. His performance is great as he goes from top of the world star to bottom of the ladder gay porn films, one of the differences in this film is that here Dirk is bi-sexual and Reed is his lover as well as friend. Anderson manages to cover lots of ground in the short 30 minute running time, covering Dirks porn career and then his successful album, which we get to see being recorded. Here we get to see him singing exactly the same song Mark Wahlberg sings, `The Touch'; the mixing of the album even features the discussion about the bass line drowning out the vocals. After this we get to see Dirk's attempt to get into the world of TV, through his own show `Angels Live In My Town'. The opening credits sequence is fantastic, easily the equal of the same scene in Boogie Nights, with Dirk running up and down alleyways, jumping over fences and doing karate kicks, all the while decked out in flares, waistcoat and cool shades. After this its all down hill for Dirk as the drugs begin to take over his life. The main thing that comes through from this short film is that Anderson is very assured about what he wanted to do, the film runs along very quickly and he gets amazing performances out of the actors. There is a great attention to detail and he manages to create a great sense of authenticity on the sets of the different films we see getting made. Anderson uses his limitations very well and creates a rawness and reality with the video footage looking very realistic in capturing the mood of the characters as they reminisce about Dirk. The dialogue is also spot on and features some classic lines and some very funny moments. The final of the film plays out in slow motion as we see Dirk and Reed hanging out while the Carpenters `Memories' plays over the top. The film is a great insight into what was to come for Anderson as well as showing how talented he must have been at 17 to be able to make something as realistic and entertaining as this. It's a must see if your into Boogie Nights or if you just want to see a very entertaining film."]},

At that time-Dr. King's focus shifted from civil rights to more equal rights in 1966. Overtly concerned about the escalatting war in SE Asia, worried about crtiticism from young people, disturbed by the growing gap betwen rich/poor. His last years in his journey grew increasingly aggresive. Such as his campaign for open housing(de fact segregation) in Chicago-1966. Operation Breadbasket in 1966. Dr. King was accused of being a \"communist sympathizer\" from the FBI. That of course was never proven and simply was a plan to neutralize him as an effective leader. Truth is King was the \"only\" man that he could not control, and that embattled Hoover. King was way too powerful. As a young whit kid growing in those turbulent times, I sill vivdly remember his images and powerful eloquent voice in old black/white footage almost every night. King was always on TV. Kings voice could could suck you in. One thing is for sure, when I was watching tv that fateful evening on 4 Apr 1968 and watching the breakthru of his shooting then announcement of his untimely death. My parents, like most white parents in that age, were frightened by King and his insurgent views. But watching and listening to his last speech given in Memphis, he kew that the good lord was going to bring him home."]},

A hugely successful player in the New York financial world, he considers her to be his most treasured acquisition. But she needs more than simply the role of dazzling accessory. Brilliant in her own right, she works at the U.N. and is involved with a struggling artist who fulfills her emotional needs. When her husband discovers her indiscretion, he sets out to commit the perfect murder and inherit her considerable trust fund in the bargain.", "She is sleeping with an artist. Her husband, much older than she, is controlling; plus, he's a rich international investor in financial trouble. Then we learn that she's in love with the artist, that she has her own fortune, which the artist is possibly more interested in than in her, and that her husband has figured out she's having an affair. He approaches the artist with plans for a perfect murder. But the best laid plans go awry.", "Steven Taylor (Michael Douglas) is a Wall Street hedge fund manager whose investments and speculations allow him to live an extravagant, upper class lifestyle with his much younger wife Emily (Gwyneth Paltrow). Unfortunately, his risky investments are unraveling; to alleviate the financial pressure and to maintain his status, Steven will need his wife's personal fortune, roughly $100 million. However, Emily is having an affair with a painter, David Shaw (Viggo Mortensen), and is considering leaving her husband.", "Steven knows about the affair; he has also uncovered Davids dirty past as an ex-convict having a long history of conning rich women out of their money. Steven meets with David to reveal his knowledge of David's true identity and then makes him an offer of $500,000 in cash to murder his wife. At first David wants nothing to do with the plan, claiming instead that Emily and he are in love. Steven then reminds David that he already has two strikes against him and that the third arrest would be enough to send him to prison for 15 years without parole.", "Steven has already laid out a detailed plan to supply him with a firm alibi. He will hide Emily's latch key outside the service entrance to his apartment. Steven will then go out for his regular card game, during which time his wife usually stays in and takes a bath. David has to sneak in and kill her, making it look like a robbery.", "The following evening, when Emily arrives home, Steven removes the key from her keychain, hides it as planned, and then leaves. That night Steven takes a break from his card game and uses his cellphone to make a call to an automated bank number, while using a second phone to call his house. Emily leaves her bath to answer the phone but is attacked in the kitchen by a masked assailant; during their struggle she manages to kill the attacker by stabbing him in the neck with a meat thermometer.", "Later Steven returnsto find his wife alive and the hired killer dead. He quickly takes the key from the killer's pocket and puts it back on Emily's keychain. Police arrive, led by Detective Karaman (David Suchet). They remove the assailant's mask and Steven sees that it is not David but a stranger, someone he later learns that David hired to do the job. Steven takes Emily to her mother's house, from where she attempts to call David to let him know that she is all right. David, under the impression that she is dead, does not answer in time. Later, Steven and David meet on a ferry boat and decide to wait until Steven has another plan. Meanwhile, Emily learns of Steven's serious financial troubles and tells the detective about this, acknowledging that Steven might have a motive to kill her.", "David has already made a tape of Steven detailing the whole plan and demands the money promised earlier for her murder. Emily meanwhile has noticed that the key on her keychain does not belong to their home; suspecting something she goes to the apartment of the dead assailant to discover that her key, in fact, unlocks his door. Emily confronts her husband with this and the knowledge of his financial problems. To her amazement, he exposes David's sordid past and accuses him of being a blackmailer conning her and threatening him. When he saw the attacker's dead body in their kitchen, he assumed it was David and took the key from his pocket so as not to implicate Emily in any way.", "Steven goes to David's loft to pay him but finds a note directing him to meet in a public place. The phone rings, and Steven picks up thinking it's David, but it's a ticketing agent confirming David's train out of the city. Steven meets David in a park and hands over the money; David gives him a copy of the tape and then leaves to board a train to Montreal. Once on the train and assuming he is safe, he opens the bathroom door in his cabin; Steven lunges out and stabs him. A dying David claims to have the last laugh because he sent another copy of the tape to Emily. ", "Steven rushes home to try to get the tape before she can. At the apartment, he finds the mail still unopened while Emily is on the terrace.

She manages to open the safe, finds the tape, and listens to it. Steven returns, and she reminds him that she still has not found her key. Emily pretends to leave to pick up food for dinner. Steven goes to the service entrance where he originally left the key for David. He finds it, and realizes that the killer had put the key back after using it to unlock the door. Emily confronts him, revealing that she knows everything now. Steven attacks her, but she has a gun and kills him, while the police qualifies her actions as self-defense and close the case. But in the closing scene Emily has a bruise on her face whereas she did not receive one in her struggle with Steven - suggesting she bruised herself to strengthen her alibi."]},

It sort of came out of the sex thing.  But then, a view of Rod's butt soon made that disappear. I liked the mother and her scene with Eric's admission he was gay.  She showed not only the pain and confusion, but offered her arms and love to her needing son.  Great acting, great scene.  The bar scenes bored me, but, then, bars do bore me.

This is a very different version, or interpretation of an excellent book. In this version, Cheryl Dempsey provides the narration for the whole movie, well, actually, I don't know if it is actually her voice, but we hear no other actors' voice. It is very well done, considering the book itself was written in narration format, the narrator being Fanny Hill. It is well filmed, and has some very beautiful scenery and sets. The acting is average, but Cheryl clearly stood out, she is actually rather good, with out without her clothes.", "This Cheryl Dempsey version is somewhat different from the Lisa Foster version. While this version is bright, cheery and colorful, the Lisa Foster version is darker and, dare I say it, more sinister.

This 1936 entry teams Collins, always good as an exasperated character, with Tom Kennedy, who usually played dim-witted policemen or underlings of gangsters. Here Monte's wife has invited her brother, Kennedy, and his wife and child to live with them, and Kennedy eats like a horse, smokes cigars, and drinks heavily...all charged to Collins! Needless to say, he's fed up. After they are about to get evicted from their apartment because of Kennedy's behavior, Tom suggests that they build a trailer and just \"Live off the land.\" The last 2/3 of the short is devoted to their misadventures as everything possible goes wrong. Kennedy and Collins, both regulars at Columbia over a long period, work very well together--they'd worked together in a handful of shorts prior to this--and lovers of physical slapstick in the Columbia (think Three Stooges) tradition will definitely enjoy this short.

Her parents are extremely critical of poor Marlene and she becomes very needy for affection. From her first baby steps into romance at a summer camp, Marlene is looking for love in all the wrong places, as it were. Her first marriage fails badly and she heads for California. Once there, a psychic tells Marlene that she will marry a doctor named Steve. Since that is the only detail provided, Marlene begins a quest to find the right physician. She even hooks up with a Steve who sings in a band called Medicine Man. This liaison results in a set of twin boys. But, alas, Marlene is jilted time and again. Will she ever be happy? Although there are a few humorous moments in the film, such as the scene where newly-wealthy Rivers tells the hired help how she wants her mansion cleaned, the whole premise of the film is pretty unsavory. It is true that women are sometimes obsessed with finding a man and that, as a consequence, kiss many a frog before finding a prince. But, it is usually not a situation that produces humor. Tilly, an Oscar winner for her divine turn in Bullets Over Broadway, is not really bad as Marline and her voice is always full of fun. But, even she can not rise above this dismal, depressing plot line about a woman's misguided search for true love. Klein and Rivers are good but their roles are relatively small and the rest of the unknown cast members are merely adequate. As for the costumes, scenery, and production values, they are decidedly average, also. If you are a fan of Tilly's, you might want to sit through the lame thing. But, in truth, unless you are a glutton for overly cooked goose, just walk away from this sad excuse for a film."]},

The story imaginatively explores the central character of Abel Magwitch and his Australian adventures. The main characters are well played, with John Stanton (Phar Lap) creating a very believable and humane Magwitch, who manages a very credible transformation from the rough convict who initially terrifies Pip at his parents' graveside, to ultimately become his generous benefactor.", "The themes of class and prejudice; justice, punishment, transportation and penal colonies; fortune and coincidence, destiny and fate; morality and kindness rewarded are all covered. The story encompasses Magwitch's transportation to Australia, his imprisonment there and eventual service to a landowner where he is reunited with his old adversary Compeyson from 'the old country'. We are shown how Magwitch came by his own lucky fortune and accumulation of wealth, and his subsequent determination to benefit his young helper on the Kent marshes. The ending is more upbeat than Dickens, who always depicts life with more sorrow than joy, mirroring his own experiences.", "It is interesting to see an Australian production based on an English story and, if some of the characterisations seemed a little quirky to me I am probably unfairly comparing them to British productions. We should remember that Dickens wrote about odd people at a time when eccentricities were more marked and tolerated, despite the accompanying social ills, than today where modern life attempts to iron out abnormalities in the name of progress.", "It seems a shame to me that the film version, edited by Hemdale Distributors out of the original ABC series, omits the adult Estella's story, as there are too few opportunities to see performances by the wonderful Anne Louise Lambert (Picnic at Hanging Rock). The brief glimpse of Estella dancing with Pip illustrates a classical beauty to rival any other portrayal I have seen.", "I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in Great Expectations, to broaden their perspective on the story."]},

I saw The Travelling Sydney Film Festival on the same weekend. So Head On is in exalted company indeed. And Head On is an Australian Film! Our strongest artistic expressions are cross cultural; those mergers and clashes that result from our second and third generation migrants growing up in Australia. Until the last few years we Aussies have tried to kid ourselves that we are exclusively Anglo Saxon people on the big screen, conveniently forgetting Eastern European and Asian migration, not to mention our Aboriginal brothers and sisters. So we've tended to wallow in vague Dad And Dave rural soapies, Horse Operas of the Phar Lap type or nostalgic, ANZAC and Breaker Morant homages to the mother country, ignoring the fact that we are one of the most urbanised countries on the planet, and that most of us have parents who weren't from within five hundred ks of London. Head On is about Ari (Alex Dimitriades), a 19 year old homosexual Greek Australian living in St Kilda Melbourne. He's a lost soul, enveloped in a broiling sea of parental conflict, drugs and sex. He's \"not proud to be Greek. He just is.\" A myriad of urban dilemmas are raised in Head On, nearly all of which are profoundly realised, but only through the briefly attentive eyes of a spaced out malcontent like Ari. I was reminded of that masterful scene in that early Scorcese film called Mean Streets; a scene which has never been bettered at showing what it is like to be drunk. But Ari isn't only drunk, he's on a cocktail of speed, cocaine and God knows what else and he's full of resentment. There's a scene in Head On where he and another unhappy soul, his cousin Betty (Elena Mandalis), slump in a toilet together, sharing their unhappiness, in a brief interlude before the madness resumes. It's a poignant, sad scene, where we realise just how desperate and empty lust and drugs alone can be. But when Ari is offered love he rejects it, violently. And that's a pattern repeated in Head On. People lurch in and out of Head On who have yet to, or one suspects may never, achieve a viable feeling of self worth. They strike out against commitment and self worth, indulging in hedonism because they can. Their parents have made the sacrifices. That looks boring to the children. Materialism is as easy as the next drug deal. Love is as easy as the next screw. Head On (the alternative title Hard On is a particularly apt Freudian slip, one  that I've been guilty of) is about the alienation of youth, particularly homosexual youth. It's also about the generation gap, magnified by Ari's Greek migrant parents. And Head On is about a dozen other, contemporary urban issues. Racism is addressed with some feeling, in the film's weakest segment, but Ari's not too concerned really. He's reasonably happy just if he gets stoned and laid; sad but true of so many. Writer/director Ana Kokkinos has masterfully introduced us to the Ari's turbulent St Kilda world. Her film is fascinating and world class. Alex Dimitriades (Heartbreak High) is fantastic. Head On is spot on."]},

He dies, and his soul is doomed to the eternity in hell for committing suicide. In the present days, in New Zeland, Elmer has the last chance to prove that men can fly and save his soul: his spirit enters in the brain of a very intelligent inventor, Jack Brown (Timothy Balme), and forces him to try to fly. Jack uses his last creation, an amplifier in a tape record, to succeed in the journey, but his invention is strongly desired by his former boss and his lover, who want to sell it to a Chinese investor. Jack's girlfriend helps him to accomplish his intent. \"Jack Brown Genius\" is a crazy and silly, but also funny comedy. It has the rhythm and elements of a cartoon, with the hero, his girlfriend and the villains. The major attractions are the names of now famous Peter Jackson, and Timothy Balme, from \"Braindead\".

The gimmick of a living anachronism is a powerful one indeed but to someone like myself who was raised on reporter movies of the 20s, who saw Cagney, Raft and Powell play these kinds of roles, using the same slang and expressions, now so out of date, I literally howled with delight.  The acting is wonderful.  As one reviewer here noted, everyone seemed to be having a delightful time.  The film is just great, from the scratchy opening credits to the final scenes.  Also, if you get the DVD, be sure and check out the reference section and scene set-up after the film is over.  They are just delightful.  Plot?  What plot?  The story is an eternal one:  Virtuous young man in the face of chaos struggles to maintain the fabric of order in a basically disorderly universe while falling in love and being too virtuously shy to declare his feelings to the girl he loves, beating up bad guys and defending the honor of helpless young women and, revealing to the world the archvillain at the root of the evil in the empire.

He's an icon of the blaxploitation era with his legendary roles as Dolemite, Petey Wheatstraw, and Tucker Williams, the Disco Godfather. Moore's films have always had a very personal quality to them, shot for cheap and distributed on their own dime. He's got a massive fan base, spanning decades with people drawing on the man for inspiration. THE LEGEND OF DOLEMITE is a short documentary that shares stories from Moore's career and the people that loved him. It explains his early career in dance and his chance meeting with a wino that inspired his most popular character: the bad, bad Dolemite. We learn of his highly successful career as one of the world's first X-rated comedians and the dozens of risqué comedy albums he's released. And, of course, the documentary touches on each of his major motion pictures, from DOLEMITE to DISCO GODFATHER. The movie interviews entertainment icons that heap praise on Moore for inspiring them in their own careers. There are featured interviews with Ice-T, comedian Eddie Griffin, Mike D of the Beastie Boys, and the late Eazy-E who sampled Moore's material in his music more than anyone else.", "As interesting as it is to hear how much Moore's work meant to these people, the real interesting interviews come from those who worked close with him. Lady Reed (Queen Bee from the DOLEMITE movies) and Jerry Jones (frequent collaborative screenwriter and Detective Blakely from the DOLEMITE movies) give their personal accounts of how Moore approached them with dreams of entering the world of comedy. The movie is a bit light on material, but it covers a lot of ground in it's one hour run-time. There's a bit of time set aside to cover each of his movies and share a little bit of the background behind them. Really, this movie could've been stretched another 30-45 minutes and I wouldn't have minded. Moore and his crew may not have been runaway successes but they remain icons of a time when African- American cinema was finding its groove. His comedy is hilarious and his movies are unforgettable, and any chance I can find to learn about the man behind the Human Tornado is worth exploring. Fans of Moore and his film catalogue should find enough in THE LEGEND OF DOLEMITE to entertain while giving a taste of the people behind the scenes."]},

It is interesting that the commentary on the DVD said that when it was first shown, half the audience loved it and half became hostile and screamed and booed through the film. I can understand this. Imagine a film scored by a scratchy old 78rmp song with some images that often make no sense--such as a guy putting out a cigarette into the eye of a baby doll and then performing an oral act on the dolls crotch. Disney this certainly ain't!! The film shows a man and a woman--the man with a gray nose and scarf and a woman in a plastic scarf. The woman mostly does nothing and the guy acts really goofy throughout. Then, in the middle, the film maker begins talking in a rambling manner for a bit as you see feet. He then plays various annoying sounds as you see odd images of a woman (perhaps the one from earlier in the film) as he continues to ramble. Finally, the guy talks about how the folks in the film don't like him any more. Then, like the first portion, it consists of similar stuff from the first portion--with no sound at all this time.

This film called ' The Width of the Pavement ' in the UK and bearing an ' X ' certificate ( this is on the BBFC site ) was a second feature and was considered sensationalist. In fact it was a sober, if melodromatic account of how through no fault of her own and rejected by society because of her poverty a 17 year old girl gets entangled into prostitution. Danik Patisson plays her well and is very beautiful, and her situation is believable as a woman who falls into the lack of money trap. She lives after her grandmother's death with the help of a social worker, played superbly by the great Anne Vernon, with an awful family, and they make life hell for her simply because she is not in their social class. The poor as far as they are concerned can go to hell, and she almost does. I will give no other spoilers but simply to say it is hard to find, but can be if searched long enough and deserves to be seen. There is a cameo performance by Francoise Rosay ( one of the best actors in French cinema and legendary ) that takes the breath away and sums up the spirit of social deprivation in one painful scene. The film moves at a fast pace and is never boring, and those in search of lurid exploitation go to another film.

And the\nparallel made in this short film are done with former disgraced president Jânio Quadros who resigned after eight months in office, and at the time of\nthis short he was the former mayor of São Paulo, and we have to exhamine his erratic and incoherent speeches and interviews from his mayoral term.", "What both men have in common besides the presidency and let's just consider 1990 (I'll go beyond afterwards): both were populist politicians who\nwere considered the savior of the nation, both made strong campaigns against corruption, both were young and had great political careers as state governors\nyet they were virtually unknown from the rest of the country and both approved idiotic laws that failed to appeal to the\npopulation or cause any good effect on them. After 1990's, we use our memory to make an even more tragic similarity between them: both resigned from\noffice: one by his own choice; the other was forced to resign after corruption charges.", "However, Collor with his \"indirect\" destruction of movies by not providing funds for new releases - and our cinema depends exclusively from the federal\nadministration since we don't have a system like Hollywood - also provided with his era in office a destruction of our cinematic memory. It happened before\nhim but somehow the movie demonstrates that a certain procedure of burning film rolls from archives was quite rampant. Burning films, apparently, works to\ndevelop broomsticks or some other object - can't remember which, but it's told at the conclusion.", "What do we get from here by seeing such comparison being made? We evidence that the filmmaker was seeing way back in time and also quite ahead\nof its time in figuring out that Collor was a charlatan just like the complicated Jânio; and both were responsible for decades of decadence in our\nhistory and politics. Both men were figures that took advantage of media to expose their views, to have their photo-opportunity and become major figures\nin the Brazilian scenery but years after their downfall, they were seen as failures that even somehow managed to get back in the arena and return to\nminor political figures (but with some expression).", "To me, it was amazing to see the contrasts and similarities not only between those two folks but also about our current government (as of the time\nI write those words). Not gonna give names but you know who: the Brazilian Trump. Like Collor, he's destroying the movie memory of our nation in different ways\nbut with the same purpose: they do not want the people to see anything about our history, our past unless if it fits their own personal narratives of the\npast. With the clear opposition of not providing funds for major television networks (who weren't so favorable to his administration) and also for not helping\nthe Cinemateca Brasileira - the largest Cinematheque from Latin America - which went through countless financial obstacles and almost burned to the ground. It\ngot helped with private funding and just recently returned its activities.", "30-something years after the movie was made, that's the vision I've got - but sadly, it won't end the same way as before. No resignation, no impeachment\nwill come - but people tried.", "A minor positive and nostalgic moment comes from a movie montage that presents several short clips from classic movies, from world cinema to\nHollywood classics and even our national product \"Macunaíma\" is there, all shown in a movie theatre where one of its attendees is a blind woman who's\nall smiley along with her partner. That's the power of movies: even a person who cannot see wants to have the movie-going experience and it's\nsomething that she'll probably carry in her memory, the sounds and effects heard, the lines spoken; and the majority of the audience will remember\nthe movie, either good or bad (usually we tend to avoid remembering the bad ones but sometimes they do stick in our heads). That little excerpt about\nthe memory of movies and how they affect our reality and the way we view or remember things is simply amazing. Lots of fast flashbacks came to mind\nwhen the movies were being presented. In a short fragment of time I had vivid memories of all the films shown there (the ones I've seen it are all\nlisted in the movie connections section). Film buffs will love this exact moment.", "Mr. Henkin makes a great cause here, it's real idea was to shine a light against the cause of film memory which was being misstreated, overlooked\nand critically ignored, and again it's a clear reminder that those who forget about the past are condemned to repeat it in the future. The most hurting\npart of this piece is when common people are interviewed talking about the \"positive\" aspects of Collor and Jânio, and they claim they'd vote for them\nwithout questioning. And it's shocking to see that people simply ignored the fact Jânio abandoned the presidency, he didn't do anything worthy of notice in\nhis 8-months period. It was a disaster. As for Collor - this bit the movie doesn't show because it'd only take place in the 2000's - he'd return to\npolitics to become a Senator - position such that he hasn't stepped down ever since. For any criticism of lousy politics, there's always someone somewhere\nwho thinks highly of disgraced figures. I'll never understand that. 10/10."]},

The locations, partially shot in Venice itself, look absolutely beautiful and are shot evocatively and with a lot of love. The costumes are well designed and have colour and atmosphere.

Benjamin Whitrow for my tastes was miscast as Antonio, too old (he and Bassanio looking more like father and son than friends), too cruel and not noble enough, didn't find him very engaged either. Had a real issue with the way Shylock is treated and written, while having no problem with Peck's acting. It is not easy interpreting Shylock, the most problematic character of 'The Merchant of Venice' and the most controversial aspect of it. He works best as an ambiguous character, not too sympathetic or too much of a villain. Here his treatment and writing go too far the latter way to near-irredeemable degrees and the production is very rough on him. So much so that he comes over as an anti-semitic stereotype, when other versions available succeeded in avoiding and addressing this.", "Overall, watchable but disappointing. 5/10."]},

In this short, Collins and Kennedy, as bank guards, are searching for a Chinese man with a wooden leg who has kidnapped a prominent scientist. Their search takes them through the eerie dark streets of Chinatown. Although a bit strange at times, the short provides some pretty good, though standard, \"scare\" situations mixed with Columbia's brand of slapstick. There are some pretty funny gags throughout the short, but unfortunately, many are politically incorrect by today's standards. That said, it's still a fun little two-reeler that is sadly not easy to view. This film was later reworked by Columbia in 1941 as \"Sweet Spirits Of Nighter\" with El Brendel and Tom Kennedy.", "UPDATE: This short has been released as an bonus on the Sam Katzman DVD Collection.

Another obscure animated dog movie--like Nine Dog Christmas, but more mature. I love Millionaire Dogs; it's off-beat and even a little bizarre. It's original but still reminded me of plenty of others as it played out. For one thing, there are cityscapes in the scenery that are completely reminiscent of Disney's Oliver & Company.", "The movie opens on a limousine that, says the foreboding music, is driven by someone evil. To our surprise a dog emerges from said limo, and you realize this poor terrier mutt is a victim of rich snobs who think it's acceptable to pull the 'drive over the bridge and dump the pup trick,' as Rumbo so accurately stated in the movie Fluke. Not much later, an old woman on a motorcycle rides by with a parrot on the bike.", "A second dog shows up; J.D. is an agile and streetwise dog who can get around on his own, like some blend of Dodger, Tramp, Charlie Barkin & even a bit of The Fox & the Hound's Chief (possibly because of his face and the way he moves.) He is, we learn, a Labrador mix (who appears for all the world a scruffy, shaggy, wiry mutt.) Rescuing the newly abandoned Chuffie, who loves astronomy and astrology, J.D. finds himself in a new home. It's Villa Lilly, belonging to the elderly woman, a paradise in the middle of a city. From the beginning, original 'pop' music plays sometimes in the background-but it actually serves to enhance the mood.", "Miss Lilly's wish is to have her house converted into a home for lost and abandoned animals, a Foster's Home for Non-imaginary Friends. The crew that already calls the place home is a tight-knit family of very different animals, each with their own talents, traits, and hidden desires. Their loyalty to each other is punctuated by the 'Daffy Little Symphony' song (which ends sounding like the friends singing together at the end of Grease) but is put to the test later on when a fortune befalls them.", "This crew is made up of three other dogs; Sherman is a Bullmastiff/Boxer-type guard dog, who longs to be a trophy-winning Olympic champ. Toy dog Velvet yearns for fashion-model status; there aren't many other canine characters who're hip, trendy teens & likes headsets & pop music. Then there is Bella, with her flowing red hair that gives the impression of a canine Little Mermaid or Jessica Rabbit. Bella is a beauty queen who gave up a life of circus tightrope/highwire performance for love--with a Lab who dumped her for a Basset hound. She and J.D. have both been around; they know the importance of freedom, the pain of rejection. Her story first made me think of Megara from Hercules; the premise of making sacrifice for a love who shows their gratitude by promptly leaving you for someone else.", "The second couple is Sherman/Velvet, a blossoming one that seems a tad odd because Sherman's such a deal larger (& older?) than Velvet. Slightly reminds me of Buster fancying Angel from Lady & the Tramp 2, but not that bad.", "A pet psychologist is employed by Lilly's greedy, strange, niece and nephew. He, oddly enough, is a goose, resembling Boris from Balto.) But Dr. Quack is willing to help Ronnie & Hannie by going so far as to try and kill the dogs. He lures each dog into his traps by appealing to the selfish dreams they have each begun to chase--why? Well, Lilly has passed away in her sleep. And her will leaves everything, including a million bucks, to the dogs.", "Like Fagin reading to his dog gang in Oliver, Lilly fell asleep on a story she was telling her dogs--but she didn't wake up. There are paranormal elements to the story; J.D. is alerted to Lilly's passing away by instruments that play themselves, & a dark shadow passes over the house. The movie isn't afraid to deal with such a sad scene. J.D. is a dog of action & the only one who refuses to fall into any of the pits the others do--despair, avarice. Every time he leaves them, he ends up returning to help. Bella is always fearful of being abandoned again.", "When the money proves to be the root of evil & goes to the friends' heads, Emmo the parrot ends up a manager to four dogs: a rising supermodel, an autograph-signing entertainer with a new agent, a bodybuilder training in his new gym, and a terrier trying to become the next Laika, & the first space dog on the planet Pluto. J.D. is the only one who sees that this was not Lilly's wish being fulfilled; he knows that they must use their fortune to help others who are as poor as they used to be.", "Quack's plot leads Velvet to a dark alleyway, certainly not the promised fashion-world, in which she finds herself lost. Sherman is locked up in a factory that seems to make meat out of dogs. Chuffie winds up in a facility for space testing--on animals. Emmo quickly realizes that someone is trying to kill them all. Bella finds herself in chains at a fur factory. J.D. must use Lilly's motorcycle to rescue everyone in a chase that also brings the ride at the end of Oliver to mind. All J.D. seems to care about immediately is finding Bella.", "Bella & J.D. create a ghost of Miss Lilly to frighten the twins away--later, Lilly's voice calls to them and thanks them. Her spirit lives in the walls of the home.", "Overall, Millionaire Dogs is fun, funny, and well-done. Admittedly, the animation in many places is strange (not in a positive way) and there are errors as well. If the dogs had been drawn more consistently from one scene to another, it would have been the greatest improvement possible for the film."]},

The acting was surprisingly good, but most of the story unfolds in flashbacks fed to the viewer in small, disjointed chunks.  The English dubbing started off badly but quickly improved.  The director drew heavily on John Woo style action, not always a bad thing, but I think the diving across a room firing two handguns at once thing was a little overdone.  I also can't help wonder where everyone kept coming up with the sawed-off shotguns.  In a nutshell, this probably won't become a classic, but I don't think it's a waste of time either.

However, Erik's thinly veiled anger toward his father and jealousy to Nina's tough ex-boyfriend Heikki a.k.a. Hessu cause things to develop into a dangerous direction.", "The always lovely Pirkko Mannola is clearly the highlight of the movie that otherwise often seems overly serious and pompous; I just wish her character had been written more diverse than the always positive sidekick for the men that she is now. The laughably overage Martti Katajisto (in his thirties!) is anything but convincing as the brooding young man barely out of his teens whose menacing fits of anger are supposed to drive the plot forward, but do so way too slowly to be interesting. The young couple's romantic strolling on a beach and in a forest cabin could technically be fitting in a more atmospheric film, but here they feel prolonged and even dull in spite of Pirkko Mannola's charisma and skimpy swimsuits. Tauno Palo also comes across as rather stiff as Erik's father. Still, the cool Ville-Veikko Salminen is funny as the car-stealing bad boy Hessu, intentionally or not.", "Furthermore, the heavy-handed style is emphasized by the dramatic and frequently sentimental score. Even though Nina ja Erik is not completely hopeless, it would have really needed a more relaxed attitude to the subject matter to work well as a portrayal of young people's emotional turmoil – the building blocks of the story just don't fall into place here. I would only recommend this one to the biggest Pirkko Mannola fans; she even gets to sing one little song during a party scene."]},

Based on a 1912 play by Maiju Lassila, the story is set in a small rural village in the early 20th century. A handsome young man named Pentti Mäkinen (Martti Kuningas) arrives in the village hoping to meet his father who worked there as a miller long ago. Upon hearing that the old man has passed away years ago, Pentti takes up the miller's duties himself and instantly wins the affections of many local girls, much to the chagrin of their jealous boyfriends. However, the only girl Pentti truly loves is Hilkka (Teija Sopanen), the daughter of a local tailor and preacher Koikale (Artturi Laakso). As expected, there are many obstacles on the couple's way to happiness, such as a crass rivaling suitor named Myrkky (Matti Lehtelä) and the monetary schemes of a local farmer who is after the old miller's inheritance.", "Just like in Nummisuutarit, the faded Sovcolor cinematography looks very charming and brings the village's green fields and blue river to life beautifully. The performances also follow the style set in the aforementioned film; everybody plays their role in an exaggerated and rather theatrical manner, but in a light comedy like this it doesn't really matter as long as the story is entertaining. Fortunately, it is: the songs and dances are fun (Kuningas' vocals were performed by legendary singer Olavi Virta), the criss-crossing romances of the villagers are amusing and the \"sinful\" strolling of Pentti and the girls at the local youths' assembling place looks adorably innocent from a modern point of view.", "Perhaps in the middle it feels that the story could move slightly faster and I wish there were more songs near the end, but since the movie is no longer than 90 minutes anyway, such complaints don't last for long. The finale where all the local girls and women end up stuck in the machinery room of Pentti's mill is pretty funny and even though the ending is as predictable as any traditional rom-com, the overall mood is enjoyable enough to make the film a fun little flick. The makers of Nuori mylläri may not have aimed high, but the movie achieves what it was going for and is thus recommended to all fans of old musical comedies and early colour films from Finland."]},

Movies like Valkoinen peura (1952) and Noita palaa elämään (1952) still retain at least some of their original power and recent titles like Sauna (2008) and Dark Floors (2008) have received attention abroad as well. From a modern perspective it is very interesting to see the very first Finnish horror film Noidan kirot from 1927 – how well is the terror conveyed through the means of silent cinema?", "Like Valkoinen peura, Noidan kirot is set in the wilderness of Finnish Lapland. The story begins when a young man Simo (Einar Rinne) brings his newlywed wife Selma (Heidi Blåfield) to his remote farm called Utuniemi to live happily with him and his blind sister Elsa (Kaisu Leppänen). However, he has to spend long periods of time away from home and during his absence Elsa tells Selma about the old legend of a powerful Sami shaman who once lived in the area and placed a curse on the local people before his violent death. Soon Elsa falls deliriously ill and Selma starts having visions of the witch too. Things are not helped by the fact that a local brute named Fat-Sakari (Yrjö Tuominen) has laid his eyes on the defenseless Selma.", "Sadly, the horror elements soon become secondary to the drama plot about sexual morality, suspicion, guilt and justice. Sure, there is nothing wrong with such themes per se but frankly, they have been done to death in later films and just cannot feel very fresh anymore even if they did in 1927, although this is not really the movie's fault. Some of the wintry scenery, the visions of the shaman and a brief flash of a hairy demon causing nightmares to Simo look cool though; I wish the supernatural elements were more prominent because the movie would clearly have had potential for more than an ordinary melodrama.", "It is of course very exciting to see authentic Finnish silent films regardless of their cinematic quality, but as a narrative tale Noidan kirot does not work as powerfully as the true masterpieces of the genre. The constant use of verbose intertitles to describe not only dialogue but also the surroundings feels excessive and the larger-than-life acting comes across as more comical than dramatic, especially with Einar Rinne in the lead role. Nonetheless, as a fan of 1920s film starlets I did like the fragile Heidi Blåfield in the role of Selma and the black-eyed Kaisu Leppänen as the sickly Elsa. The highly dramatic music composed by Tapio Tuomela for the 2010 re-release sounds pretty good and helps the film significantly by filling in moods where the images don't always succeed. Visually the movie is rather psychedelic; instead of regular black and white, the screen is always tinted with bright colours like yellow, green, blue, red and even pink or purple at least in the version I saw.", "It goes without saying that Noidan kirot is a must-see for cinephiles interested in the history of Finnish cinema, but judging solely from its inherent merits, it left me somewhat cold much like director Teuvo Puro's earlier film Ollin oppivuodet (1920) that is also a part of The Finnish Broadcasting Company's project of re-scoring old Finnish silents. As a curiosity the movie can certainly be recommended to horror buffs though and Tapio Tuomela's score can be easily appreciated by film music aficionados, so ultimately Noidan kirot is not a worthless effort by any means. Still, to me it is a film to be appreciated more than liked."]},

But the major scheme is all there: the duality of being prude since she's a devoted\nwife and mother as opposed to a liberated and fully aware of her partner's sexual desires with some perversations explored. Deep down inside she knows those letters\nare the only things that make her alive and desired; otherwise, she'd jump out the window since her marriage is a boredom. Yet she never writes back to the man but there's\na catch about that which is best to not be revealed.", "For future screenwriters, this is a must-see work to analyse how adaptations can be translated to the screen. There's no betrayal from the original source, there\nare plenty of verbatim used, and the imagination takes over in seeing how Helena acts through the days while her thoughts are on full display. The only thing from the short\nstory that was left out and I thought it'd be hilarious if included is a moment where she gives dozens of many different names to the male anatomy (it's hilarious!).", "Outside of the world of\nwriters, the regular viewer will find amused and curious with the whole situations presented, and it deals with an universal aspect of everyone's lives with questions\nabout how peculiar and contradictory human beings can be: to follow the mind and thoughts, or following the heart and its desires; to be on a stable relationship or the\npossibility of a wild adventure. The heart seeks pleasure first but the mind is stronger and overthinks everything. Oh poor Helena...but she knows the real version of herself. 10/10."]},

Perheen musta lammas is the story of an orphaned office worker named Raili Wirma (Sirkka Sipilä) who moves into her own apartment from the custody of her three oppressive aunts. Soon she finds herself deep in debt and breaks up with her boyfriend Topi (director Nortimo), but gets an idea when she accidentally gets a job as an errand boy while being dressed as a guy for laughs. In order to make money for her creditors, she tries to maintain several false identities in different jobs – easier said than done.", "The humour is not highly imaginative, but there are many amusing details in the movie anyway. Sipilä looks funny as a boy and pretty as a girl and certain supporting characters are fun too, for example Siiri Angerkoski as Raili's uncle's wife Salli (a former opera diva) and the trio of Raili's conservative aunts (Elsa Turakainen, Verna Piponius and Henny Valjus) who complete each other's sentences like Huey, Dewey and Louie in classic Donald Duck comics. Some cinematic techniques are more interesting than in many average old Finn-films: the surreal dream sequence and the clothes-changing scene in a moving elevator look cool, as does the semi-long take introducing the beauty parlour where Raili finds a job under a false name. Some moments are also a bit more risqué than expected from a movie of the era.", "Nevertheless, I don't think the romantic plot lines work as well as the identity-related ones. Raili has three men trying to woo her, but the final relationship feels like an obligatory happy ending instead of a natural part of the story. Even so, Raili herself is an interesting character thanks to her openness to shady methods like stealing and deceiving in order to reach her goals. Still, she too has to taste her own medicine when an artist named Rautia (Joel Rinne) blackmails her into becoming a nude model for him. This plot detail in particular is actually surprisingly dark considering the rom-com premise, but in the end everything is resolved with no hard feelings, of course. I doubt a similar joke could be done in a modern comedy without accusations of sexism – attitudes do change over time.", "In any case, as a whole I thought the movie is somewhat watchable and entertaining little comedy. It is not Jorma Nortimo's best film and I think funnier movies have been made in Finland and elsewhere, but if nothing else is on, Perheen musta lammas makes an alright pastime for 90 minutes."]},

Overflowing with intensity and hyperkinetic camerawork, this is a frightening roller-coaster ride of a film; despite clocking in at less than 90 minutes, \"Pi\" is by no means short on resonance - but rather leaves a heavy feeling of exuberance and fascination with the material that lasts long after it's finished. At the same time, though, people who aren't as open-minded to more obscure, abstract films like this would be, I think, surprised. This is not as complicated or bewildering a film as I had expected. If one can be able to focus intently on the story, the result is rewarding, and doesn't provide for much head-scratching.

And, in fact, Owen would be older as well, but it's assumed he's still going to be sexy. As a bit of trivia, Annis is now 68 or thereabouts and still beautiful. Also, she had a 12-year relationship with Ralph Fiennes, 17 years her junior (I saw them together in Hamlet some years ago)", "The other situation in the film is the class distinction, still prevalent in Britain, Robson with his working-class accent and beer-drinking father, involved with the glamorous administrator Annis, married to a highly-successful surgeon.", "So though \"Reckless\" seems like just a romance, it actually, seen today, brings up some provocative questions.

Not only that, but they were also brilliantly voiced by Kevin Kline and Kenneth Branagh who just give so much spirit to the role it's hard not to admire it. Rosie Perez also does a fantastic job in her role voicing Chel, who is just about the most gorgeous female character i've ever seen in an animated film. I'm not simping, you are. The music is also quite good, with a soundtrack composed by the great Elton John. It may not have as many familiar songs as The Lion King, but it stands strong in its own right. The pacing is just so well done, you can admire how entertaining it is even if some flaws feel rather predictable and formulaic along the way. We have familiar tropes here and there, but in the end, The Road to El Dorado is as charming as a film can be- and easily deserves more praise than it received on release. Its colorful and imaginative and completely earns its spot among fellow 2D animated films.", "My Rating: 8.6/10."]},

He seeks employment on a building site which is an abandoned housing estate being converted into a hospital. Stevie gets the job along with around a dozen other \"riff-raff\" (low-income, working class) men in Tottenham. Learning that he is homeless, Stevie's new workmates Larry (Ricky Tomlinson), Mo (George Moss) and Shem (Jimmy Coleman) volunteer to find him an empty flat to squat in Twyford House, a nearby housing estate in South Tottenham.", "One day, Stevie meets a struggling brunette Irish actress and singer named Susan (Emer McCourt) when he finds and returns a handbag belonging to her. At first wary about meeting Stevie when he shows up at her rundown house at Spensley Walk, Stoke Newington, Susan eventually warms to him by inviting him in her house for tea. This chance encounter leads to a turbulent relationship.", "Stevie rounds up some of the men from the building site to support Susan at one of her pub gigs where she sings \"Always On My Mind\". The drunken audience is initially hostile over her sub-par singing voice, but Larry shames them into calling Susan back for an encore and she sings \"With A Little Help From My Friends\", which is much better received. When she gets evicted from her house over repeated late rent payments, Susan agrees to move into Stevie's flat, where they are happy for a time.", "On the building site, life continues as a series of small escapades and petty misdemeanors. Larry is vocal in his left-wing political views and opposition to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and the ruling Conservative party. No one shares his view that politics is important to their real-life situation. Meanwhile, the management sack men for minor misbehavior and are only superficially interested in safety. One eccentric worker, named Smurph, is sacked for playing cards with his workmates while on the job.", "On one payday, since most of the employees do not have bank accounts, including Stevie, to deposit or cash their paychecks, they ask a fellow employee, an African immigrant named Fiaman, to cash their paychecks for them in exchange for paying him five pound sterling per check. Fiaman does cash their checks and gives them their money, but they go back on their word and pay him only five quid (pounds) instead of five each.", "Another day or two later, Larry gets into a minor accident when he falls in a port-o-potty toilet on the site and is soiled with fecal matter. So, he sneaks into a vacant furnished apartment off the site to help himself for a bath, only to get discovered by a female real estate agent showing the apartment to a group of veiled Muslim women which prompts him to flee, wet and half-dressed, from the apartment and back to the building site.", "Meanwhile, Stevie and Susan's relationship becomes strained. Susan tends towards negative emotions associated with her lack of career success. Stevie, on the other hand, can be callous and unsympathetic to both his and her plight. One day, Stevie goes to a local theater where Susan is auditioning for a spot on a local play and when she is rejected by the director and casting agent, he approaches the men and threatens them which prompts them to have both him and Susan removed from the area. Susan takes out her anger on Stevie who feels that he ruined her changes for the acting gig.", "One day, after hearing his name on a radio, Stevie phones his home and finds out that his mother has died, so leaves to attend her funeral in Scotland. In his absence, Susan starts using heroin dealt by three youths on the estate. After his mother's funeral, Steven refuses to stay in Scotland and hitchhikes back to London where he enters his flat and discovers Susan getting high by shooting heroin. This precipitates the end of their relationship which prompts an argument over his directionless life and her lack of career choices. Susan pays Stevie a visit at the building site in which he tells her to quit doing drugs or their relationship is over. Susan leaves and when Stevie returns home after work, she is gone.... having departed for places unknown.", "A day or two later, Larry is sacked from the site after requesting safer working conditions. After jokingly making an expensive phone call on the boss' Gus Siddon's mobile phone, Shem also gets the sack (and is arrested for the assault that follows).", "Near the end of the building work, Desmonde (Derek Young), a young West Indian construction worker, falls off the roof of the converted hospital and, despite Stevie and Mo's efforts to save him, he loses grip and falls to the ground and is severely injured. The cause of the accident is unsafe scaffolding, which the men have already warned about. This incident marks the last straw for Stevie and he decides to get back at management.", "In the final scene, Stevie and Mo return to the building site in the middle of the night and set a huge fire in the building and watch as it burns to the ground."]},

Many of the over-the-top comedic scenes, such as Mauno manhandling Olli with a tablecloth or the recurring joke of Eero having trouble with his hand hygiene, are outright hilarious and the supporting characters like an old sailor Matti (Hemmo Kallio), a gossip lady Sanna (Kaisu Puuska) and a farm maid Leena (Kaija Suonio) are excellent in their exaggerated roles. I also want to give an extra nod of approval to Laila Rihte; her Elli is very lovable in all her emotionality.", "Over all, the movie was a positive surprise to me thanks to the visuals and funny actors. I recommend Roinilan talossa to anyone who likes old Finnish films – in the genre of silly rom-coms it achieves what it was going for and provides good old-fashioned entertainment."]},

It seems harder and harder to find quality in a television show these days. Or maybe I'm just picky. But especially when it comes to Australian television, I'd love to see more quality.

I've watched as many Australian shows that I can, and SeaChange is still my favourite. ", "Everything about it is absolutely wonderful. As a show, it's hilarious, touching, warm, light, sad, happy and everything in between. The characters are emotionally real and you can't help but fall in love with them, even Bob Jelly. And the actors amaze me every time I watch an episode.

Yes, I am deeply ashamed to admit I wasn't one of those people who watched from the very first episode the first time it originally aired. As a teenage viewer at the time, I just didn't tune into the ABC channel very often. ", "But that first episode that I saw had me hooked instantly and blindly. I fell in love with the show.

I went back and watched every episode as the ABC repeated the series, and again on cable.", "The show presented some great messages as well, I thought. Overall I believe the message/ theme of the show was that life never turns out as you might expect, but often it turns out better if you just stop and learn to look at it a certain way. That if you want things to change, often you have to seek out that change yourself and be willing to see where it takes you. I also liked the message of that if you look close enough, the people you think you have nothing in common with, are more similar to you than you realise. ", "SeaChange is definitely a show I'd recommend. It does have a unique sense of humour that I've been told is very Australian (whatever that means), so maybe some people won't see it as hilariously funny as I do. But it's extremely well written and acted, and most importantly, it's a blast to watch. It's fun. It's entertaining. It's quality television.

From her beginnings as a fresh-faced country girl in the joy of first love to her miserable decline, the men who loved her, betrayed her, or tried to aid her are examined one by one and the ironic twists of fate that snatched happiness from her grasp are laid bare. Like 1937's Stella Dallas, Maija is a proud and strong woman who does the only thing she can do to support her daughter in a world that is stronger than she is, where women are \"prisoners... like fish in a net.\" It's not a happy story but it is well-told. My first thought on seeing the opening moments of this film was that they don't shoot movies like that any more. It is not always sophisticated and the technique owes much to expressionist European films of years before - at times it seems more like 1924 than 1944. The scenes of her early days resemble Soviet films with their healthy peasants dancing under big skies. For me the background music was the weakest point, not always entirely appropriate to the mood of the scene, but the overall effect is strongly emotional and at times quite beautiful and stirring. It was interesting for me to think of how certain events and scenes would be done very differently if the same story had been made in Hollywood - it is refreshing to see a more bluntly realistic depiction than the cleaned up, smoothed over American version would have been, and a more stylized and symbolic presentation of strongly emotional events that hearkens back to silent picture style. For fans of genuine old time melodrama, or for those with an eye for sincere unsophisticated yet effective filmmaking, this can be a very enjoyable experience."]},

His new name is Otto Josef Klems. After the war, he joins the French Foreign Legion as Sergeant Otto Josef Klems. The year 1924 finds him in a French Foreign Legion garrison in French Morocco. Two European powers, France and Spain, control colonial Morocco. However, both colonial powers face strong rebellions from the local Moroccan tribes that unite in order to defeat the European armies and achieve independence for Morocco. During the course of his duties in Morocco, Sergeant Klems runs afoul of a new brutal commanding officer, a Captain. Disgusted by his Captain's behavior and by the treatment of locals at the hands of the French troops, Sergeant Klems decides to desert. It seems that others, too, had the same idea, since many native troops desert the French garrison at night. On such a night, Sergeant Klems is on duty and surprises a group of French soldiers of native origin, desert to the enemy. Klems refuses to shoot the escaping deserters, due to his personal friendship with some of them. Unfortunately, his Captain finds out about Klems' refusal to shoot the deserting soldiers and court-martials Klems. Found guilty, Klems is condemned to prison but he escapes from the garrison's jail-cell and deserts. Wondering in the desert, he collapses in the heat and without water or food. He is found by a passing Bedouin who takes Klems prisoner and sells him to the rebel army of rebel Moroccan leader Mohamed Abdel Krim. At the rebel stronghold, Klems is about to be executed by the rebels when he witnesses an accident. A group of rebels attempt to load a captured French howitzer with the wrong caliber ammunition. While hammering the round into the gun's barrel, the round explodes killing many rebels. Klems intervenes and saves the life of a beautiful Moroccan woman who happened by. She turns out to be the sister of the rebel leader. Klems tries to tell the rebels they cannot load a gun with the wrong type of shell but the rebels, who only speak Arabic, dismiss him. At that moment, the rebel leader Mohamed Abdel Krim, who speaks a few European languages, notices the incident. He allows Klems to explain the correct procedure of loading and firing an artillery piece to the curious rebels. Sensing an opportunity to save his own life, Klems offers to teach the rebels how to properly use captured enemy artillery pieces. But he also has another reason to want to stay alive. He wants to meet the beautiful woman whose life he just saved. Eventually, the rebel leader Mohamed Abdel Krim allows Klems to join his rebel army and to meet his sister. However, a small rebel army of natives has little chance in defeating the combined armies of several European powers that are determined to end the rebellion by any modern military means necessary."]},

A group of men are gathered in a private room in a restaurant. As the evening wears on, toasts are drunk in honour of friends not there. Inevitably, as the memories and emotions come flooding in, the drink opens up old wounds and yet suitably numbs the senses at the same time. Drunkenness and overindulgence ensues. This same scenario is still repeated today, wherever soldier gather. WWII was a time where ordinary men and women found themselves in situations where life was fragile, killing meant survival and an act of mercy or humanity could, and sometimes did cost the lives of their comrades, let alone risk their own. The uncertainty of war undermined many peoples trust of there being a tomorrow. For many, the only choice worth making was to live life to its fullest, while it was still there to be had. This is such a story. It does not attempt to glorify, glamourise or gloss over merely in order to entertain. It is an attempt at letting the extraordinary circumstances of war tell it's own morally twisting tale. When the war finally ended and soldiers would return home to try and return to a \"normal\" life, normality had become a strange concept. It turned out that for many, the guilt, bitterness and horrors of war had no armistice. It is no wonder many soldiers would never speak of their experiences to even family members, let alone an outsider. There certainly wasn't the mental health and social services we enjoy today. In Finland in 1963, the only people who seemed to understand an old soldier's pain and confusion were the war comrades who would gather once a year to drink a toast or two for friends not there."]},

As such, it basically plays like a typical TV episode but packs in far more action and more spectacular stunts than normal for the show. I have the film as part of a DVD set of sentai movie spin-offs of the 1980s and it comes in Japanese with no translation, so I can't give much of a plot description. Still, it's mostly action anyway and easily enjoyed if you already have a love of the genre.", "As usual for the franchise, there are outlandishly costumed villains, including four female henchwomen in attractive outfits who do most of the heavy lifting. Here they kidnap two impossibly cute children, a girl, Yukari, and her younger brother Tsutomu, and hold them hostage while laying in wait to ambush the Sun Vulcan team when they show up to try to rescue the tykes. They've also got a monster on deck, played by an actor in a rubber suit, to create extensive property damage and provide the formidable opponent sentai heroes always needed. This one boasts a head that looks like a gumball machine circled by little cannons.", "Atypically for this franchise, Sun Vulcan consists of only three rangers, Red, Blue, and Yellow, all male. Their support team consists of an older man and his daughter who run a café when they're not working the control room for the team's various vehicles. Sentai teams from that period tended to have very large truck-like vehicles that would fly to the scene of battle and then unleash smaller vehicles and various weapons. Here the truck also transforms into the familiar-looking giant robot (or \"zord,\" as such combat vehicles would later come to be known) which the heroes use to fight the monster after it turns giant-sized. I love the colors used for the vehicles, with the emphasis on primary colors (just like the three Rangers), a look enhanced by the rich color film stock from that period, something that cannot be recaptured in the digital era.", "Another great thing about sentai shows of this era is the inclusion of large numbers of risky stunts, often performed by the actors out of costume. Here we see the Red Ranger (\"Vul Eagle\"), before transforming, dangling from an actual helicopter by ropes and the camera zooms in to reveal that it's the actor himself and not a stuntman. Another notable aspect of the action scenes in these shows is the reliance on actual locations in and around Tokyo for the staging of the fights. Here, they take over a construction site in Tokyo for one sprawling battle scene and make use of the terrain quite creatively. There are also fights along cliffsides and on rocky coastal outcrops facing the sea. These can't have been easy stunts to pull off--in full costume--so they're pretty exciting to watch.", "The lead female villain, Cyborg Queen Hedrian, is played by Machiko Soga, who made a career out of playing such villains, and is best known in the U.S. as Rita Repulsa in \"Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,\" in which ample footage of her from its Japanese counterpart, \"Zyuranger,\" was dubbed into English for the U.S. version. Soga's character is seen only briefly in this movie and only appears in two short scenes, while her four female lieutenants, led by Yukie Kagawa as Amazon Killer, do most of the work."]},

A possible explanation may stem from the detail that HRH Prince Edward, the Duke of Wessex was an Executive Producer on the project. Interested students may recall that the present Royal family vetoed proposed DNA testing intended to establish the identity of remains found within the Tower precincts as those of the missing King and Duke. Nevertheless, the rather haphazard series of vignettes presented over the course of the series do include several well-dramatised and interesting stories about one-time residents of the Tower and those whose history is bound up with the structure. Most, of course, met a sticky end and this is not a series for the faint-hearted history buff. Examples include the portly Ranulf Flambard, duplicitous Geoffrey de Mandeville, Peasants' Revolt leader Wat Tyler, ill-fated Lady Jane Grey, Sir Anthony Babington and his fellow plotters, Protestant Pretender James Scott (the first Duke of Monmouth), fortunate rogue Colonel James Blood, the tyrannical Judge Jefferies, Henry Laurens, the only American ever imprisoned in the Tower and the hapless German dentist turned spy, Josef Jakobs, who was the last person executed at the Tower, on 15 August 1941."]},

It turns out that these two movies must have been shot back to back, as the locations (even the same weather!) and major cast are identical. Leslie produced \"The Last Resort\", directed by Wesley Emerson, and watching them together is terrific fun, both released by major label of the time VCA.", "Lauren Hall plays the title character, a beautiful woman who hires hapless Randy West to ghost-write a novel for her. Most of the film has West, standing in for the viewer at home, primly watching Hall and other characters make love -very artfully photographed to maximize both the voyeuristic content and also the mounting frustration his character feels. Director Leslie really nails the feeling of helplessness here, and in so doing shows his understanding of the whole (complicated) porn phenomenon where, alas, us poor schlubs addicted to watching these masturbatory vehicles are at once turned on and simultaneously subconsciously-humiliated by the need to watch rather than to do. I can't think of a more effective XXX film in capturing this whole process, while remaining arousing -avoiding the Brechtian turn-off effects mastered by Jean-Luc Godard (and if truth be told, copied my hundreds of pornographers, to whom Godard is an unacknowledged major influence, just the way Bergman more obviously has been).", "Hall is so beautifully styled here, in terms of makeup, severely pulled back/moussed hairdo, etc., that it could be her best film, too. Stealing one scene is aptly named Selena Steele, very hot doing some stand-up sex in a corridor. There is also a memorable, slow-paced massage table scene by Hall that involves deep focus and is quite a tribute to Leslie's ability to balance technical excellence with the usual need to \"deliver the goods\".", "I've always been a John Leslie fan and realize he has received quite a bit of recognition in the Adult field. Would that people someday will acknowledge the fact that film (and now video I guess) is a continuum, and rather than rushing to stupidly compartmentalize everything (I give a lot of recent blame here to Tarantino and his VIDEOSTORE education rather than a classical University period of scholarship, for encouraging a rack jobber's mentality to pigeonholing film, rather than keeping an open mind) they could instead give each INDIVIDUAL work its due. Not preventing thinking by use of jargon and mindlesss labeling: e.g., \"the best nunsploitation movie\", \"the best slasher movie\", \"the best Restoration Comedy\" (just threw that in to see if you're paying attention). In such a parallel world, John Leslie would receive his laurels, and The Tease would emerge as an all-time classic."]},

In this movie, he sits in a bar called \"Apocalypse Now\" (written in the same font as the film).", "Featured in ", " (1999)", "Tony Bui's \"Three Seasons\" takes place in the teeming nightlife and the majestic hotels and the open marketplace and  squalor of modern day Saigon. It is symbolically a film about traveling the historical past and present, put together in four uneven vignettes and how the lives of five people crisscross each other.  Bui is not obtrusive and so his film is gentle and sweet and he lets his actors play out their roles with naturalness and grace.   The gentleness of this film can be both its strength and weakness, because you leave thinking about discrete images beautifully photographed but you don't really have a sense of what Bui was trying to say.  The image of sweat running down the face of cyclo drivers and the red abrasions on naked skin across the woman's back caused by a spoon are just two examples. Also, unlike Western soap opera, he isn't here to manipulate.  Take the old man, Master Dao and his terribly scarred up face and amputations.  Dao could have been afflicted by the after effects of napalm or a land mine explosion but, no, he has an old-fashioned affliction, leprosy.  There is no post-Vietnam hate in Bui. The spirited cycle race through the streets of Saigon descends upon us without much buildup nor dramatics.  We don't realize the significance of Hai winning this race till we see what he does with his winnings.  Perhaps the few times Bui decides he needs to make an explicit statement, he does so with subtlety:  the plastic lotus flowers which outsell the naturally grown ones, the opulent, newer hotels rising in Saigon turning the society into truly haves and have nots (what Bui calls the people of shadows), and the hardworking cyclo driver straining to move his vehicle as his Western couple occupants chatter oblivious to his struggles.   The other weakness of \"Three Seasons\" is that the four vignettes are so interesting that each could have occupied the entire film. Instead we get incomplete servings from all four and a hunger to know more. Bui spends more time with the cyclo drive and the prostitute and the water lily girl and her poetic master.  The story about the street smart little boy, who is forever in the rainy streets looking for his missing case of trinkets to sell and finding both the case and a tender companion in the end, could have stood by itself.  Similarly, the Vietnam vet who comes back to find his lost daughter because he has to 'right a wrong' is a beautiful piece that needed more detail than what the film provided.  The final scene of \"Three Seasons\" summarizes this film neatly - the falling crimson pedals from trees lining a boulevard.  It is picturesque in its beauty but the meaning of it is more effervescent than lasting."]},

Just about everything about is well done, and satisfying: from the music to the characters to the mech designs.  It's also very appealing to a wide audience, featuring exciting action sequences (some serious gore in the unedited version, to warn younger viewers), romance, comedy, drama and some very surprising plot twists.  The animation is fluid and motion-picture quality, with a very unique style.  And the musical score, (composed by Yoko Kanno, famous for Cowboy Bebop and Brain Powered, among others) is just as impressive as any to come out of Hollywood.  The dub isn't the worst I've ever seen, but it really does the series no justice.  See it sub-titled version if possible.  In short, Escaflowne is a top notch series that is definitely worth seeing."]},

Here, there's a fair amount of nudity, but predictably little (until near the end) from the \"name\" actor, Berger. This being German cinema, the sexuality feels kind of clinically observed rather than erotic, while there's no attempt at all to get any kind of suspense or intrigue going. Every once in a while the \"action\" (such as it is) is interrupted by still photographs of the actors' faces, while we hear their commentary on the characters' feelings and how they relate from their own experiences.", "The film immediately feels like a somewhat boring, talky, non-commercial experiment, interesting as a reflection of the cinematic and cultural moment, but really like an uninteresting, semi-improvised stage play unnecessarily filmed. It's neither any fun or very meaningful, with little engagement possible with these rather jaded, petulant characters, whose arguments are alternately personal and didactic. The ending, at least, is sort of impressive: One actor (no, not Berger) walking a crowded urban street, ranting amidst real-life gawkers, stark naked, until finally dragged off by police.", "Movies like this are always interesting in the abstract, because the period was so full of very personal efforts that amplified the artistic, political and social issues of a period in which society seemed to be changing so rapidly and profoundly. But many of these movies are also tedious as art (let alone as entertainment), and despite its curiosity value as a rarely-seen obscurity, \"Glass House\" is indeed a bit of a bore. It's hard to imagine it really had any life at the time beyond playing festivals.

Firstly, it's well and truly hilarious. Secondly, the recovery of this long-lost recording vindicates for television something I've long maintained for cinema films: no movie or TV programme should be considered 'lost' unless it was deliberately destroyed. Sadly, the BBC are notorious for wiping their own programmes and taping over them ... and so, far too many great moments of British television history are indeed gone forever. Unless the transmission patterns are still bouncing off Alpha Centauri.", "Another IMDb contributor, Elena-48, has already reviewed this recording. Elena's review is perceptive but contains one niggling error: Alan Bennett's sermon is ostensibly about Esau and Jacob, not Ezra. Bennett's sermon is hilarious, as he piously and pretentiously draws metaphors between sardine tins and human existence. ('I wonder: is there a little bit you can't reach under the sardine tin of your life? I know there is under mine.') Here's something which this recording doesn't mention: an audiotape of Bennett's hilariously pretentious sermon is now used as a training tape in the Anglican church, warning newly ordained priests of the sort of claptrap they must avoid.", "The opening sketch, with its references to the Cold War and Harold Macmillan, is necessarily dated but still funny ... especially when Peter Cook warns the gaunt Jonathan Miller to 'try to look well-fed'. Elsewhere, we have Miller as a prisoner in a death cell: Cook bookends this routine, setting the scene and then returning for the punchline.", "Cook and Dudley Moore perform their brilliant 'One Leg Too Few' sketch, with Moore as the one-legged 'unidexter' auditioning for the role of Tarzan. Over the decades, Cook and Moore performed this routine hundreds of times, forcing Moore to spend many cumulative hours hopping on one foot. As Moore actually had a clubfoot (only partially corrected), the effect on him was not pleasant. But the routine is uproarious.", "At intervals throughout, Moore performs his brilliant piano solos. The entire cast perform 'So That's the Way You Like It', skewering Shakespeare hilariously. Less effective is a routine in which all four portray camp homosexuals. A high point is Jonathan Miller's bizarre monologue, 'The Heat-Death of the Universe', pondering the fate of trousers that are abandoned on British Railway trains.", "My own favourite here -- a quietly hilarious set-piece -- is Cook's solo turn, as a demented monologist sitting on a bench, explaining why he could have been a judge but ended up being a coal miner. Although the character is never named here, Cook privately named this creation E.L. Wisty, and depicted him many times over the decades. Cook's E.L. Wisty routine changed significantly at each performance, as Cook introduced new improvisations.", "Periodically throughout this taped performance, the camera cuts away to show the audience. I felt this was a mistake, as the laughter on the soundtrack makes it clear that there's a live audience. Much more effective are the close-in shots, enabling us to see the expressions on the faces of the cast as the sadistic Cook ad-libs, trying to 'corpse' his castmates (especially Moore) and make them break character as they burst out laughing.", "With Cuddly Dudley and 'Cookie' now both dead, and Bennett and Miller having largely forsaken performance in favour of their other talents, it's a delight to be able to see this crucial record of these four comedic geniuses at their peak. And this show is pretty damned funny, too. I'll rate it absolutely 10 out of 10."]},

Unfortunately, halfway through, he falls in love with one of his dates and now has to figure out how to complete the project without alienating his new love.", "What makes this different from standard mockumentaries -- and what some of the other IMDB reviewers seem to be missing -- is that, while it's clear that the final film isn't a true account of the events (some of the dates are obviously faked, and Elie the villainous producer can't really be THAT evil), it isn't so clear whether Myles Berkowitz (credited as writer and director, as well as star) started out with a serious intent to make a documentary, or whether it was meant to be fiction from the outset.", "Most of the evidence points to Berkowitz' initial sincerity. This *is* his only film (except for a bit part in \"No Small Affair,\" 16 years before this movie), and Elie *is* listed as Executive Producer. The official budget *is* the stated $60K. Most of the early dates seem real -- it's only the later ones that start to feel scripted, especially the feminist ballerina.", "One thing that gives this movie its charm, then, is that while Myles (the character) fumes about the way in which his original vision for the movie is eroding away from pressure from Elie, Berkowitz (the filmmaker) seems to be going through the same genuine quandary for a different reason -- it didn't take his full 20 dates to find love, and NOW what's he supposed to do?", "The cover job is both charming and disorienting: He goes back over the old footage and edits it so it looks like it could have been a mockumentary from the start, but plays it from the hip so it looks like a mockumentary pretending to be a documentary.", "Wouldn't Robert McKee be proud?", "Others might not have the same sense of pride. The film will come off as either a clever if ham-fisted attempt to make lemon footage into lemonade, or a pretentious and annoying trip into the avenues of Independent Film by a blind drunkard.", "Viewer's choice, and it seems to depend on what the viewer thinks of Myles: Is he annoying, or is he cute?", "I thought he was cute, and while the film is hardly a classic, it's worth a try.

We begin with Alanna Ubach as a New York book publisher going home to the unspecified fall suburbs for Yom Kippur. Ubach being Jewish allows Podolsky to present cartoon stereotypes of Jews as shallow and materialistic, who even talk over the rabbi in temple when he speaks of the \"permissiveness of difference\", something you would think Jews know a lot about. It doesn't help that Podolsky thrusts these people at us, with comic cutting and appropriately bad music by Andrew Hollander. Presumably Ubach is meant to feel superior to her family, though the weakness in this is that Ubach fails to supply any charisma to her role, and Podolsky doesn't help by giving her wretchedly written scenes of arguments with her boyfriend, Michael B Silver eg \"He: Relax. She: Don't enforce passivity\". So this unbalance of perspective throws the tone askew, though thankfully the narrative refocuses onto Lesley Ann Warren as Ubach's mother. Granted that LAW is not the Jewish mother type, she has the best scene in the film, after tense behaviour with her husband James Rebhorn, and blue lit flashbacks that reveal nothing. She reacts to news of a friend's illness by breaking down, with Podolsky giving her an unbroken long take. However soon we're back to Ubach and a doubly long scene between mother and daughter that is as wretched and pointless as those between Ubach and Silver. If Podolsky's disservice to the actors isn't enough, her editing in general is heavy handed, and she even supplies a reflective-memory montage like a trailer of her own movie, in the movie!"]},

The two gangster organizations plan to sell the dangerous and deadly nuclear weapons to the highest bidders who for the most part are terrorist-type groups in the Middle-East and Africa who have the millions to buy them. Bob Zorkin, Charles Naper, a former Navy Seal instructor is sent by the US government on a secret mission to Russia using the cover as an American tourist. Zorkin's job is to find out and report back to his bosses in the US Pentagon and State Department who's involved in the Russian government and military in dealing with both the Russian & US Mafia. Told that if the Russian government can't stop the gangsters, American & Russians, from selling the nuclear material It's his job to use his skills as a Navy Seal to take them out.

Bob then goes to the hotel room where Rod Armstrong, Frank Zagarino, a former student and good friend of Zorkin is staying at. ", "Armstrong is training the Russian secret service in the art of modern combat methods that he learned from Zorkin with the Navy Seals. Before you know it Zorkin is killed and later his wife Susan is kidnapped by the US/Russian Mob. The murder and kidnapping of Bob and Susan gives Armstrong the opportunity to show his stuff in taking on the two mob organizations and at the same time saving the world, or the city of Moscow, from nuclear annihilation. ", "The two mob organizations , US Mafia & Russian, are trying to find out from Susan why her husband was in Moscow, as if they couldn't figure it out all by themselves. But the mobs main reason is to get Armstrong out of the way before he stops them from getting their hands on the nuclear weapons and also find what was on a tape that her husband Bob gave him. ", "\"Armstrong\" really makes no sense at all with the US mobsters, for reasons known only to themselves, trying to trick the obviously drunk and naive Russians to get them to blow themselves up with the nuclear weapons that they were going to sell them? The movie never takes the time to explain why?", "Armstrong takes care of the both US & Russian mobs and the corrupt Russian military men single-handedly wearing a tuxedo that he had on when he attended the Russian Opera. Armstrong also saved the Russian president from being assassinated by Ponytail with his tuxedo not having as much as a tear or even a as much as a smudge of dirt on it after he took care of business. Armstrong's fight with Ponytail is also ridicules when after it looked like Armstrong killed him, by sticking a knife in his chest, Ponytail pulls it out and is even stronger and almost beats Armstrong with half of his blood supply drained out of his body.", "The reason for Ponytail & Co. being so eager to find the tape that Bob Zorkin gave Armstrong was also nutty when you finally saw the tape it. The tape showed what you and Ponytail and his mob cohorts should have already known. The secret tape showed that the US government was investigating the Russian/US mobs who it suspected of working with corrupt elements in the Russian Army to get their hands on Russia's nuclear weapons. Shouldn't they have know that just by Zorkin being sent to Moscow by the US State Department?

The movie started in a highly promising way and as it proceeded, I found myself just lost in the narrative, having no sense of the world around me. The spellbinding suspense and the highly intriguing storyline tied me tight to the TV screen. Finally I reached the climax of the movie, flowing effortlessly with the twists and turns of the story and after seeing 'THE END' on the screen, I was highly satisfied to the fact that I have watched an engrossing, PAISA VASOOL type suspense-thriller of the sixties. However being a mystery fan, I could not help rewinding it in my mind and then I found that the screenplay had many holes and the hurried end of the movie did not provide satisfactory answers to many questions raised during the freely-flowing screenplay.", "Bahaaron Ki Manzil (1968) starts with the awakening of Radha (Meena Kumari) from the state of unconsciousness. She recalls that she had fallen unconscious after a deafening explosion in her surroundings. But after giving a look to the interior of the concerned room and seeing her face in the mirror, she finds that several things are not the same as they were prior to her getting unconscious. A song - Nigaahen Kyon Bhatakti Hain, Kadam Kyon Dagmagaate Hain (a memorable song of Lata Mangeshkar) falls into her ears and with that starts her strange journey in which everything comes as puzzle before her. She finds the house, the servants, her belongings, a young girl (Farida Jalaal) calling her mother, the neighbours and even the city as strangers for her, not having come across in her life prior to falling unconscious. The biggest surprise is that when her Jijaji (elder sister's husband, character played by Rehman) comes home in the evening, he shows himself as her husband and calls her as Nanda who was her elder sister. The whole life becomes an intricate, spider-web like puzzle for Radha with respite coming from nowhere. She feels like going mad. She keeps on crying that she is Radha and not Nanda and she had fallen unconscious not just the previous day but several years ago, but none seems to be listening to her, leave aside believing her.", "But then one sympathetic psychiatrist, Dr. Rajesh (Dharmendra) believes her. And he only helps her in finding out the truth behind this mysterious scenario. After fast-paced and thrilling chain of events which include a murder also, the mystery gets unfolded before them. It's unbelievable, yet true.", "Bahaaron Ki Manzil is a movie which once you start watching, is hard to leave in between. The suspense, the thrill and the curiosity for the viewer combine to produce an enchanting aura. Within a few minutes of the start, the viewer may find himself lost in the flow of the story and that's the success of the storyteller. The loose ends, the unanswered questions and the fact that the screenplay is not well-knit on the basis of pure logic; all these things have no impact during the first time watch because they can be noticed only when the movie is over. And it's better not think about them (like Jitendra Mathur). The better thing is to just feel the pleasure of having a thorough entertainment of 165 minutes or so. The storyteller does not give any time to the viewer to think in between the flow of the narrative and the viewer just go on watching in a spellbound status.", "As I have already mentioned, there's no laxity in the narrative. Technically and production value wise, the movie is all right. The length of the movie may seem unusual to today's audience but considering the fact that there is not a single boring moment in the movie, it does not seem to be a minus point. In fact, I feel that the storyteller had better added 10-15 minutes more to explain certain things and tie some loose ends.", "Performance wise speaking, the best performance is of Dharmendra, the kind-hearted psychiatrist who (perhaps) falls in love with Radha who is, in fact, many years elder to him in the movie (and in reality too). Dharmendra was quite dashing in his heyday and he's such a natural performer that appreciation emerges naturally for him from the core of the heart of a genuine movie buff. Rehman is another great performer. Farida Jalaal and other supporting cast is OK. The biggest disappointment is Meena Kumari in the central role. She looks alcoholic by her face and is not able to impress by her performance.", "Laxmikant Pyarelal have composed good music. However after the movie is over, only one song remains in mind which I have already mentioned above. Ye Daaman Ab Na Chhootega Kabhi and Aaja Re Piya are also good to listen. Majrooh Sultanpuri has penned the meaningful words of the lyrics.", "I recommend this entertaining suspense-thriller to the mystery fans as well as the social drama audience alike. Watch it and it will give you full value of your time and money."]},

This one is takes a warts and all look at Busby Berkeley (1895-1976), acknowledging his genius and his decline (mother fixation, alcoholism, the 3 vehicular homicide trails) in honest doses. During his tenure at Warner's, Berkeley managed to resurrect the Hollywood musical, considered box office poison from 1930 until the astonishing double whammy of 1933's 42nd Street (released in March) Footlight Parade (October) and embarrass most other studios' choreography (Paramount's 1934 Murder at the Vanities would've benefited tremendously from his input). Crippling flaws aside, Berkeley was the best at his craft. It's also notable that he was perfectly capable of excelling as a \"straight\" director: his last film at Warner's was an excellent John Garfield entry, They Made Me a Criminal (1939), while most of his most fondly remembered earlier films had journeyman contract directors helming the overall pictures. It wasn't until Gold Diggers of 1935 that he gained sole directorial credit, which unfortunately would end in his embarrassed involvement in 1949's Annie Get Your Gun. His career would essentially be over by 1953. A big plus is that director/writer David Thomson managed to located 82- year old Berkeley favorite Toby Wing (1915-2001) and her 81-year old sister Pat and obtained interviews with them both (sadly, both have since died). This is a definite \"10\" for anyone who loves movie history. This is a hard-to-find title (I had to buy a VHS on eBay) since PBS has never obtained release rights.

This is also her first pairing with Rajendra Kumar with whom she did three or four more films. Rajendra Kumar did a very commendable job as the compassionate doctor and a loving father to the child. The child actor Honey Irani who played Raju had a great chemistry with Meena Kumari and the pair did a great job as a mother and child. Meena Kumari generally does excellent work with children as she did in others like Bhabi Ki Chudiya, though she never had children of her own in real life. Madan Puri was respectable as the senior doctor and Minoo Mumtaz did act very well as the villainous wife of Dr. Anand (Rajendra Kumar). The movie has some very good songs and Devendra Goel's direction was above average. I graded it as being eight out of ten and recommend to Meena Kumari as worth watching."]},

I cannot remember a movie like it in my time. The theme of the movie was priceless. Having two rich hobnob kids toying with various people's emotions in their neighborhood was just great. In fact it is not at all silly to think that this does not happen in real life, because if you don't believe that then you are very naïve. ", "There are many people who need to be praised for this classic movie. Director Roger Kumble did a great job in bringing this movie to our screens. He added so many little `steamy' pieces to this movie that it was never going to fail. Then you have the producer Neal H. Moritz who also allowed this film to shine. He gave this film all the right production touches, which I can only praise.", "Then you have the wonderful cast that was assembled for Cruel Intentions. The main star for this film would have to be the gorgeous Sarah Michelle Gellar. She was outstanding as the horrible Catherine. Her character while at times was extremely hard to like, she was almost too hard to not want to like. I mean she was every guy's fantasy. Sexually liberated (and not afraid to admit it), then all she wanted to do is screw up all her enemies at the same time. Then you have the patronising and stud man' Sebastian, played by Hollywood hunk Ryan Philippe. His performance in this film was also first class. I thought his character was a lot more likable then Catherine's, but you could sometimes want to strangle him for the way he screws with people, just like his stepsister does, and then still seemingly gets more women dying to be with him. ", "Other cast members just help to make this film an extraordinary viewing experience. Reese Witherspoon is fantastic as the pure and innocent, Annette. She helps to balance the sour bitchy side of the cast, with her friendly almost sickening goody goody side. I am looking forward to seeing Witherspoon in the comedy, Legally Blonde, directed by new Australian director Robert Luketic. Selma Blair was also very good in her role as the dumb and very naïve Cecil. The kissing scene that she has with Gellar was one of the highlights of the film, with the kiss being voted the best onscreen kiss a few years ago.", "Then this film has another great side to it, that of the soundtrack. It has so many great songs on it. Placebos tune `Every me, Every you' helps start this movie off, then you get songs such as Colorblind by Counting Crows and the classy, Bitter Sweet Symphony, by the Verve. This would have to be one of the world's most popular soundtracks from where I view it.", "In conclusion, Cruel Intentions is a film I can say I love and that I can learn from. People in real life do use people and do hurt them. I know this because I was involved in such a scenario not so long ago. Nothing was ever happy until it was a fight and scrag. I will go as far to admit that I was confronted with a real life Catherine, a person who was such a goody goody on the outside, but the real person on the inside is a person that loves to cause trouble and will go out of her way to do it. Anyone who is like that is a real low-life in my view. Get swept up in the nasty love triangle, Cruel Intentions'!", "Rating: 5 Stars or 10/10"]},

", "This type of fetish junk has come a long way since Costello's efforts, and now some of the video features, particularly those of Ernest Greene and his wife Nina Hartley, are extremely sophisticated, employing professional masters or mistresses of the rope and other bondage artists to craft something approaching art (at least for those who enjoy this genre).

His internationalism may seem far-sighted and principled from a distance, but was this a message that needed to be drummed so unsubtly into his audience (many of whom would have been bereaved in battles such as this) at this particular time? \"If I had to choose between betraying my country and betraying my friend, I hope I should have the guts to betray my country\", as he famously remarked in 'Two Cheers'. Well, if I was faced with such a difficult choice, I hope I would be less dogmatic about it than E.M.", "The narration, contrary to the opinion of most of the other reviews, is terribly ill-judged. Declaimed in a gloomy monotone by Michael Redgrave, the viewer is left with the impression of moral equivalence between the allies and the Nazis.

Most of these men have looked inward and sought the need for change, and have seized the opportunity to reform there lives, often times looking toward God.

Any way, here is my review: \"Forbidden Ways\" is pretty much a loose story line about a swinging couple who tell each other their sexual experiences they had while they were separated from each other. This plot contrivance justifies a series of strewn together, badly filmed, sex scenes that on balance are pretty dull. Worse, the porn stars are pretty scuzzy looking and it makes for repulsive viewing.

As he could not get all the facts of the story, his account is rather fragmentary and more like a sketch than a real novel, but the basics are there, and the main phenomenon is the red thread of the issue. Out of this fragment of a novel, the Italians have created a comprehensive operatic drama with many important characters, each playing some important role, and of course the story of Alexander Dumas fragment is completely replaced by a grand opera with an international cast - Geoffrey Horne, Valérie Lagrange, Gérard Barray, Jean Servais, and Valérie Lagrange is even singing - in English! The script made into a considerable harvest of intrigues out of a bean fragment is a masterpiece in itself, and in Italy this film is considered a classic, while few outside Italy have learned to appreciate its credits - almost like you have to love Italian opera in order to see its values. As always in Italian films, the acting is superb and convincing enough all the way, and to frame the dramatic story, they have found all the most romantic spots of Corsica and turned the film into a great romantic epic of love and death, blood and tears, false identities and established social positions based on lies, and so forth. The case of the twins standing in telepathic contact throughout their lives is the main theme and cannot be explained away, and that's what fascinated Alexander Dumas. He often engaged in occult subjects and tried to penetrate them thoroughly at length, and this was one of them, rather a natural phenomenon than anything occult or supernatural, but the more remarkable for being a fact."]},

For the record, his, um, \"death scene\" does not even use a \"stunt double\"--it's filmed strictly softcore, since great of talent as he was, no one really wanted to see HIM getting a bj.", "They obviously spent a little money on this, even filming some of the final scenes on the open ocean (today they'd probably shoot this on video in a bathtub in somebody's San Fernando Valley condo). There's some great surreal scenes like where the mermaid somehow comes out of toilet(!) to \"attack\" the \"Hooper\" character (and his \"stunt double\"). And at the end of the movie the two male leads are entirely replaced by well-endowed puppets(!) in a scene that really makes me wish that ALL male porn stars would be replaced by puppets. I'd watch a lot more XXX movies if they were half as entertaining as this one."]},

Ariana stops by the office but turns down the starring role he offers because it involves anal sex, a no-no for her.", "She visits her boyfriend Luc Wylder (real-life husband, though unconfirmed whether they had already married at the time of this shoot), and hearing of her plight he gives her a massive mechanical dildo machine to try out anal sex with, the sort of hardware one sees in BDSM epics.", "\"Happy Ending\" continues for its duration with an anal fixation that certainly services the fetish fans in the video audience, at the expense of anything of interest occurring. That is the failing of so many porn features over the years, contributing eventually to the gonzo revolution, as audiences naturally became impatient with the pointless or stupid (or insulting) story content -and now insist on cutting to the chase.", "Along the way Debbie Diamond and Bionca expend plenty of energy in showing how they enjoy anal action, with d.p.'s and dildos part of the required equipment. In a near-classic scene of jazz porn (hypnotic soundtrack music dominating), Ariana solo tries out the machine on her vagina and has orgasms that are convincing and arousing. Later she goes full-bore with anal, first with Luc doing the honors and later in shooting a different project in which she performs a 3-way with Jonathan Morgan and Luc Wylder. When director Bionca says \"Cut, yes that was great!\" our non-story about going anal is over, not a minute too soon.", "Video does illustrate a common mistake in porn, often telegraphed by the standard practice of the players using their stage names as their character names. In a feature like this one, we are not watching a story with characters, but rather watching porn performers like a voyeur watching a prostitute couple, hump. The intended confusion of their real-life personae (was Ariana really hesitant about anal sex or was merely money the stumbling block?) and the same-name characters they play for the camera is not very interesting, especially when the successful, recognizable stars play this routine hundreds and hundreds (the men thousands) of times. Give me a real characterization by Veronica Hart, Richard Pacheco or Mike Horner anytime over this fake-reality documentation of sex acts."]},

Also the contrast between Syd's relationship with the down-to-earth Lucy on one side and the pretentiousness of Lucy's drug using friends and the editors from Frame on the other, was refreshing. This isn't a movie that beautified the art world, this showed the hard reality. Take for instance the scene in which the head editors - who pretend to know all about photography - never have heard of Lucy Berliner, but don't want to admit that to their pears and therefor start lying or how they aren't interested in the art itself, but only in the money that it will earn for them as they publish it...", "After I had seen this movie and already had decided what rating I would give it, I went to see on IMDb which rating this movie actually received from others. It struck me that most men seem to hate this movie, while almost all women seem to like it. Perhaps it is because those men hoped to see more of the lesbian relationship between the women (including a steaming sex scene), perhaps it was because they believed this was an 'art movie' (which in reality it isn't). Anyway, I'm a man too, but I liked what I saw. I found the contrasts in the story, the delicate love story,... and especially the ending all very interesting and moving. That's why I give this movie at least a 7.5/10."]},

This version of the story, filmed in Germany, simplifies the structure of the original piece, and in the process actually weakens the characterization--and muddles the whole point.  I mean, the script was a structural tour-de-force!  Why did the German film-makers simplify it? Cold feet, I understand.  But what is left is still an edgy neo-noir that polarized German audiences into \"love it\" or \"hate it\" camps.  The director uses a huge arsenal of visual gimmicks including shifting depth-of-field within a shot, and the end result is cool, sexy film-making.  Nicolette Krebitz rules the screen, Dietrich Hollinderbaumer oozes menace, and Sunnyi Melles and Axel Milberg steal the film in their funny supporting roles as a couple of con men.  Katja Riemann shows up in an extended cameo as a hit woman.  The conclusion was filmed exactly as originally written, as far as I can remember, and is really fantastic.  All in all, it was a surprise and a pleasure to come across this movie, although I still have my fingers crossed for the American version some day."]},

It stars James Purefoy, Rachel Shelley, Christopher Adamson, Don Warrington & Paul Brooke. The plot sees a prison ship on its way to the remote Marshelsea Island Prison run aground and sunk. The survivors, a mixture of cons and prison staff, struggle ashore a tiny island that's only function is to house a lighthouse. Thanking their lucky stars for surviving the wreck it's not long before they realise their luck has quickly run out. For psychotic serial killer Leo Rook has made it ashore before them and he has no intention of letting any of them survive the night.", "Funded by Arts Council money, Hunter's movie took some time to make it on to the screen. What began in 1994 ended with a video release in the US (as Dead of Night) in 2000 and then two years later it got a limited theatrical release in the UK. As a slasher movie, and a generic one at that, Lighthouse doesn't veer from the norm. However, it's still a very tidy effort that gains the maximum impact from its truly eerie setting. This dark and rocky little island that is intermittently lit by the Lighthouse is perfect for stalk and slash shenanigans. And so it proves. Yes the characters are too one note and not given the best of dialogue to churn out, but for its look and nicely handled set pieces the film ends up better than average.", "The cast, in spite of said bad dialogue, are more than adequate, particularly the game Shelley and the enjoyable Brooke. However, it's Adamson as nut-case Rook that leaves the best impression. As a killer Rook is really just a British version of Jason Vorhees or Michael Myers, but with his calm unflustered movements about the island, resplendent in bizarre white shoes, Rook manages to terrify and intrigue in equal measure. Why he is the way he is is not known, but this adds to the air of mystery that surrounds the man who likes to collect heads for decoration purposes! Of the set pieces, the finale is noisily OTT but works well, even if Hunter's use of slow-mo smacks of pointless pretencions. But it's with the quiet tension filled scenes where Lighthouse earns its spurs, one in the bathroom is as good as it gets for this type of film, while another involving a lifeboat down on the sand is also hold your breath enjoyable. Shot by Tony Imi on location in Cornwall & Hastings, the film is also visually appealing for those who like a grainy noir like sheen to their horror. With Hunter clearly in that frame of mind judging by his nice usage of the off kilter shot. While Debbie Wiseman's surging score has a very 50s feel to it.", "It's safe to say that anyone looking for something new in this now tired of horror sub-genres will be disappointed. But the look, the feel, the setting and no shortage of the claret; more than makes up for its adherence to genre staples. 6.5/10"]},

Granted it's nothing spectacular but it did at least leave a lasting impression on me after seeing it as a youngster late one night on the BBC in the mid-80's.  It's also worth noting that director John Laing received two awards for the movie soon after its release.  What struck me upon watching it all those years ago was the beautiful location shoots and the very spooky atmosphere that permeated throughout aided by a chilling score and frequent nighttime footage.  John Bach plays the dual role of identical twins Edward and Maxwell Scarry.  Max, an anthropologist, has gone missing and is feared dead after going in search of a mysteriously disappeared tribe on a deserted New Zealand island.  It soon transpires however that his disappearance coincided with the murder of a prostitute back on the mainland, for which the blame is fingered on Edward, who must now go in search of his brother to prove his own innocence.", "\nLaing pays some nice attention to detail and is obviously quite a big fan of horror movies, even though this is as much a mystery as it is a horror film. Some of his ideas, such as Max's telepathic daughter, now seem dated but there are shades of The Wicker Man with the island setting and the hunted leading the hunter.  The theme of good versus evil is quite nicely played out as well although perhaps it would have worked even better had Edward been a little bit more of a goody two shoes.  Nevertheless it is as good a dual-role film as I've seen.  That is partly down to the make-up department though more to do with the fact that Max only appears in the last few minutes by which point we've had ample time to build up a character profile of somebody quite nasty."]},

This could have all been top-heavy but even as a debutant, she manages to make it a fascinating story without getting caught up in the drama contained in the story. The film shows her professionalism and experience gained as a directing assistant. She clearly knows the story she wants to tell and how to create it. As far as I am concerned, it is a great loss for Dutch cinema that she has only made 2 films.", "Why the two main characters have chosen each other doesn't become clear to us. We have to suspect that it was probably the easiest option for both of them. After all, these are two people who never dare to say out loud what they really think or feel.", "If the characters have names at all, they are never mentioned, and are only referred to as 'the brother-in-law', 'the maid'. The husband, played in an apathetic manner, seems only interested in macabre news items from the newspaper that he sticks into his scrapbook, and collecting images of flowers. According to his wife, his heart is frozen due to years of working in a cold storage unit.", "The woman herself is expectant of a grander life, though she takes no steps herself and only stays at home, bitterly dreaming of 'something'. Whether she finds that in the romance with her brother-in-law is very much to be doubted.", "The setting in which this film is taking place is rather small, which nicely depicts how limited the world is in which these people live. We are only shown this small Belgian village: we see the factory, the church, the house and the streets in between. The time in which this film is supposed to be set is not entirely clear to me. I suspect the 1950s, with the young maid symbolising the new liberated times ahead.", "The story is narrated alternately from the perspectives of the woman, the young maid and the man. It occasionally alternates with scenes depicting some of the newspaper clippings the man has collected. These short rather absurdist scenes provide a nice variety to the story, and elevates the films as a whole.", "The acting is very well done, although the characters are rather typical they never start to annoy you. Credit also goes to the young girl playing the maid in what was apparently only her second film. The camera work is nice without becoming distracting. The setting of, among other things, a beautifully simple Belgian working-class house in the middle of the 21st century also contributes to this.", "As far as I am concerned, this is definitely recommended for anyone interested in Dutch cinema. This is a film that deserves a nice sharp (bluray) release and a rediscovery for film enthusiasts!"]},

The scene in question is the one where Otávio Augusto\ncharacter talks about a sunny wednesday afternoon being the last day of the week and he says it while at work. Anyway, what's \"Muito Prazer\" (\"Nice\nto Meet You\") is about?", "The adventures and misfortunes of three architects (Augusto, Cecil Thiré and Antônio Pedro) dealing with work, relationships, parties, drinking\nand also dealing with three street urchins who keep messing around with everyone around, either in helpful ways or just making some pranks or spying\non women (specially the wife of one of the men). Thiré's character is happily married but that won't stop from having an affair with the wife of\nAugusto since the woman is in need of someone because all her husband wants to do is to drink himself and cause plenty of confusion. Pedro's character\nis a mystery in the group, he's the best friend of everybody but doesn't get involved with anyone - I have a suspicion that he's gay and unlike the\nother two confused character, he's happy with whoever is in his life.", "David Neves is a film hard to define. It's a sure comedy with near disastrous drama moments - mostly related with the drunk character who causes\na great deal of absurd througout the picture (but he's hilarious). But it's hard to define as to what exactly it wants to reveal when it comes to the\ndynamics of relationships and how men and women view each other, need each other or not, in a chaotic environment that always seem to invite them to\ninfidelity or adventures. Like the kids who keep fooling around without facing consequences (but close to it, as evidenced when they threw a rock at\na car and the driver called the cops on them), those grown-ups feel like they can do whatever they want. Luckily, conscience gets in the way, sometimes\njust a piece of great advice (or luck) helps them sort it out their problems.", "On an entertaining level, \"Muito Prazer\" is a hit of amazing proportions and I was quite surprised to see how funny this movie could get. The\noutrageous alcoholic played by Otávio Augusto is unique with his chaotic behavior, drinking on the job, always asking for the secretary to bring\nbuckets of ice for him, and it's amazing that he manages to escape consequences. It's a hysterically funny character (and performance), but in real life\nhe'd be appaling. But if we look for a dramatic prism where we should evaluate things to a higher and meaningful perspective it's a vague experience\nwhere one can attest that adults sometimes fail to mature, and instead they make some childish actions, and that's why the men are somewhat accomplices\nof the troubled urchins. Crazy world. 6/10."]},

I first heard of this film from an exploitation documentary that stated this was one of the films that were made just to show in \"alternate\" theaters back in the day for people who wanted to see some nudity. Having now seen the picture I'm not 100% sure that the point of this movie was to just show nudity and be exploitive of the people even though some of those elements are here. The majority of the running time takes a look at non-exploited stuff including the wildlife of Africa as well as how the communities are changing. The mondo style narration actually doesn't help much because of the way Reynolds delivers all his lines. A lot of the times the narration is just a tad bit too over-the-top and it doesn't help that the music score often kicks in at \"dramatic\" moments to try and make a scene more important. I think most people will be mildly amused by the stuff dealing with the wildlife because we really get some up close shots of various animals. There's an incredibly large crocodile that you'll see and there's other animals like giraffes, elephants and more. There is quite a bit of nudity from the women who all go around topless. Again, this aspect of the film has been sold off as exploitation but it's really not. It's just presented as how things are and the camera never lingers on it or even draws any attention to it."]},

But it's all great stuff.  In between the cod clips, he meanwhile paints a touching (and even more hilarious) portrait of senility. Perfectly judging the line between the sublime and ridiculous, \"Norbert Smith\" is a wonderful creation.  This material could have run and run: instead, it ended where it started (though some of Enfield's later creations were clearly developed from ideas first tried here).

It has bits of everything, and it shows many human values anyone of us may have. It also has a fine portrayal of society. The society is presented in both bright and dark sides in this film, though not in a way that can be called positive. A commonly hated and infamous thief, Shaka, who comes to rob a well-known family, finds himself saving the life of a young ill and dying widow, Shanti, who was left to die by her in-laws during an epidemic. She has been long maltreated by her in-laws, and when they come back home, they discover to their surprise a healthy Shanti. Her brother in-law tries to rape her, and that's how Shaka takes her to his home. There the real story of coping begins for them. Shanti, an extremely religious woman, tries to help Shaka to make amends. The entire street is gossiping about the two and about Shanti in particular for entering the house of an infamous criminal.", "This is a touching story. The main hero has become a thief and a criminal not because he wanted to, but because he was forced by circumstances. The film shows humanity in so many instances and in an amazingly delicate way. It shows how cruel people can be. Shanti's own family leaves her to die while a criminal is the one who actually saves her life. After a few months of living together, Shaka understands he cannot live without her. Shanti's modesty, honesty and intelligence all make Shaka understand that he has found the first true love of his life. Even his pickpocket friend, Kalicharam is charmed by her attitude. I still remember the scene when he first meets her and asks her what he can do for her, and she answers, \"nothing, brother\". He breaks into a big laugh as he never heard anyone speaking so fondly to him. I was deeply moved by this scene.", "The performances are wonderful and every actor contributes to the film in his own way. Dharmendra, in one of his finest performances, is restrained and serious. No songs are pictured on him, and it contributes to the intransigent and tough features of his character. Meena Kumari is wonderful as Shanti. There is no doubt she is one of Hindi cinema's greatest actresses. She is graceful and dignified, and though she cannot be called beautiful (that was the time when she began gradually losing her good looks), she is presented as the epitome of goodness and Indian feminine simplicity, which is aided by her natural acting and excellent line delivery. Shashikala, as Shaka's lover, is extremely beautiful and vibrant. She is the complete opposite of Meena Kumari in this film: westernised, bubbly, at times unkind and always attractive. While the entire film shows her as a woman who is just sexually attracted to Shaka, we later find out that she really loves him. Ram Mohan as Kalicharan is hilarious with his comic sense. Lalita Pawar is great as Shanti's evil mother in-law.", "The film has many dramatic, romantic and comic sequences, all of which are very memorable and moving. The music, composed by Ravi, is just out of this world, and Asha Bhosle sings exceptionally every song. Her rendition of \"Sheeshe Se Pee\", which is one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard, is outstanding. Other songs such as \"Sunle Pukar\" and \"Zindagi Se Pyar\" are also brilliantly performed by this phenomenal singer. The film's title represents both Dharmendra's and Meena Kumari's characters very well. Her Shanti is Phool (flower) and his Shaka is Patthar (stone). How can a flower and a stone live together? You will have to see the film to understand it. A classic 60s picture."]},

The director doesn't need to tell the audience where to go emotionally with heavy handed music cues or dialogue - he knows exactly where he's taking us and lets the images speak for themselves.

The \"dream\" sequence goes on for a few minutes, and is very striking with its use of colour, makeup, and choreography. Overall, this is a very well made film that looks glorious on Blu-ray. It also serves as a 93 minute snapshot of a particular place at a particular time.

For centuries the Armenians had been terrorized by the Turks, but this was a period of serenity between the Turks and the Christian-Armenians. However, the War had hit Europe, and the Turks had informed the American ambassador, Henry Morganthau, in Constantinople, that the Armenians were giving support to the Turks' enemy, Russia. Despite Morgantheau's objections, the Turks issue a decree that the Armenians must be moved southward into the desert. The Turkish governor, a Pasha, comes to Aurora's father and demands she be given him as a bride. The father tells him his daughter will not give up her Christian belief, as she would have to do to marry a Muslim. The governor leaves in anger. The order is given for the removal of the Armenians. The men are separated from the women, and the Armenian soldiers are forced to disrobe and dig a trench, and then are shot down by the Turks. Mothers are torn away from their children and the Armenians are marched away into the desert where, famine, thirst and fierce heat await them. Aurora escapes to a mission school ran by Edith Graham, an English girl. The Turk soldiers surround the school and Miss Graham protests under the protection of the English flag to no avail,as the Turks trample the flag, and the Armenian girls are dragged away. Miss Graham, determined to help the girls as much as she possibly can, disguises herself as one of them and joins the march."]},

I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. While certainly not a masterpiece, 'Shades' is a treat for two reasons : its mild albeit funny comment on the film industry and its unashamed 'American' approach. Its main aim is to entertain, and if it manages to work on quite a few levels along the way, who's gonna complain? A smart blend of fact and fiction, it focuses on the filming of the life of serial killer Freddy Lebeck -who, as Belgian viewers may note, looks an eerie lot like real-life mass murderer Freddy Horion. He, for one, is famous for never taking of his shades. Slick and fast-paced direction makes for a flashy thriller, and although no-one in it will be winning an Oscar any time soon, the many jokes and winks will help to hold your attention until the very end -which, I will reveal, is pretty original in comparison to what Belgian cinema has been calling conclusions lately. Add to this the admirable quality to poke fun at itself, and it's perfect for a rainy day."]},

For the first few minutes of the film, I thought this would be a documentary. In a sense, when I realized when it wasn't it was a letdown, because even though this is a close-to-life depiction story of a kid in the ghettos of Washington DC, somehow if it really was a documentary it might've been even more compelling. As it is, Slam is a very naturalistic first-person drama, and the film deals with a protagonist that isn't hard to identify with, even when things seem a little over-done or even when it's a little naïve.", "Basic story in two sentences  Raymond Joshua (Saul Williams, also one of the film's co-writers) is set up to go to prison for pot, and while in prison he meets a few people that recognize his skills as a writer and poet.", "When he gets out he wants to hold on to the freedom he knows he can attain, but he doesn't know how. With this conflict, Raymond is a character that is recognizable and identifiable with the audience. And with this, Williams creates a constantly believable performance even when his character may not sound entirely believable or realistic.", "Although the performances are a plus for the film's success, such as Bonz Malone as Hopha, and Sonja Sohn as the writing teacher/poet Lauren, for me the style over-passed the substance. Though the poetry was inspired and the poets in the film who spoke them were very good, some of the story elements were not as effective as they could've been. For example, there's a blind-men analogy when Raymond gets out of jail and sees that his pot-dealer friend, who got shot, is now blind. Raymond is morally in the right in their final scene together, but it's a little too thick of a message for my taste when Raymond says, 'I once was blind too, now I can see.' Williams' poetry (which I assume he wrote himself) is interesting, although it's his delivery that catches my ear over the content. In a pivotal scene his poetry saves him from a beating in the prison yard, yet somehow it doesn't feel as real as some of the other scenes, like with him and Malone's character.", "As I said, the style was what held the film, especially for such a low budget. I loved the use of the hand-held, shaky mis-en-scene, as though someone was allowed to peek into the atmosphere of DC. And from a psychological standpoint, Levin seems to extract what the essence is of Raymond and his neighborhood. Through his usage grainy color and then to a 8mm camcorder for flashbacks from Raymond, I felt the emotional impact that Levin was going for, the mix of disorientation and of being in a free-fallin' kind of society where you don't know what can happen next. I just wished that I saw more of that with the characters and the story. Cool ending though. B"]},

The original purpose of the unit was to make films publicising the work of the British Post Office, and it did indeed make a number of films on this theme, such as the famous \"Night Mail\". Many of its film-makers, however, interpreted their brief much more widely, producing a series of documentaries about all aspects of British life, and \"Spare Time\" is one of these. ", "The director was Humphrey Jennings, also a founder of Mass-Observation. Although this organisation existed purely to carry out sociological research, its title has always struck me as slightly sinister, as though it had been set up because someone somewhere felt that the masses needed to be kept under close observation otherwise who knows what they might get up to. \"Spare Time\" reflects Jennings' fascination with the everyday life of the Common Man. It was made in 1939, just before the outbreak of war, and details the leisure-time activities of three working-class communities, the steel workers of Sheffield, the cotton workers of Bolton and the miners of South Wales. Information is mostly conveyed through pictures alone; there is very little commentary. (What there is is provided by Laurie Lee, at the time working as a scriptwriter for the Film Unit but later to become famous as the author of \"Cider with Rosie\"). ", "I must admit that I couldn't see what the point of this film was. The interest of old documentary films like these is generally the insights they give into social history, but the running-time of \"Spare Time\" is far too short to give a comprehensive picture of Britain's leisure habits in the thirties, and does little more than recycle a few clichés which were probably over-familiar even at the time. It has, for example, long been a widely-held view in Southern England that every working- class Northerner spends his leisure hours racing pigeons, breeding whippets or playing in a brass band, and the typical Englishman's mental picture of Wales includes the information that every self-respecting Welshman, and certainly every self-respecting Welsh miner, is a member of a male voice choir. (Or, as Flanders and Swann were to put it \"He works underground with a lamp in his hat, And sings far too often, too loudly and flat\"). ", "There are a few striking visual images, but these are mostly of the industrial background to the film rather than of the leisure activities which are its subject. On the whole, however, this was not a film which told me anything I did not know already, and I doubt if it told people in 1939 anything they did not know already. Except that in Bolton jazz music was for some reason equated with a rendition of \"Rule Britannia\" on massed kazoos. Evidently recordings of Louis Armstrong and Benny Goodman were in short supply in the record shops of the Lancashire cotton towns."]},

Never mind that she's wearing petticoats, too: it just would not have been done, certainly not by a woman of her class. David Odgen Stiers may be well-cast as Benjamin Franklin, aka \"Poor Richard\", but the part as written reduces this incredibly significant and complex man to a cartoony caricature, one surrounded by gewgaws and experiments gone awry and prone to spouting pithy parables and folksy sayings masquerading as wisdom.

Alan Alda once said that making a movie about the American Revolution was an exercise in futility - and then he went and made a movie about making a movie about the American Revolution. \"Sweet Liberty\" took certain liberties of its own, but it does offer a glimpse as to why Rev War movies are difficult, to say the least. If you cannot take yourself seriously, then you must take yourself completely lightly. Instead, \"Taking Liberty\" wants us to take their zipped-up-the-back dresses and button-down-the-front shirts as seriously as it wants us to take a Benjamin Franklin played for laughs. Were it not for the ever-hammy, scenery-chewing David Warner as Sir Leopold, this turkey would be utterly unwatchable.", "RevWar reenactor types, however, may LOVE this movie, as it is a non-stop gagfest of farby clothes, fabricated history and outrageously inappropriate and anachronistic conduct.

It wasn't under that heading but that of the William Hooker Quartet whose members are Hooker on drums, Okkyung Lee on cello, Ras Moshe on saxophone and flute, and Sabir Matteen on sax also. The drums dominated the underscore to the first 20 minutes before all the other instruments came into play. I thought that score was pretty compelling for the story presented on the screen with the band being visually dissolved during the inter-titles. The plot itself, about a racist group-one of whom is a mulatto who hates blacks with a passion-that tries to scare a black owner, named Van Allen, of a valuable property off was something that had to be addressed after D.W. Griffith's The Birth of a Nation. Too bad that scene of the Klan being defeated by another black man throwing bricks at them is currently lost as that would have made it a very exciting picture indeed. As it is, there's still the mulatto woman, Eve, whose happy ending with Van Allen is all but assured after things are cleared up that provides some fascination with the way Micheaux seems to like to present a light-skinned woman as more worthy of the hero than one with more darker skin or maybe I'm reading too much into the plot line.

At that time, very little else of Micheaux was known to exist, and at the time no modern film scholar had seen anything like it, nor was it generally known that anything like it had been made at all. At the time, \"Ten Minutes to Live\" seemed so unique and out of the ordinary that such critical notices as were written tended to be charitable. Nevertheless, those who then saw the one, terribly battered print of \"Ten Minutes to Live\" weren't sure what Micheaux was up to; whether it was some kind of art film or some species of genre that they did not recognize. Fast forward four decades and we know a lot about Micheaux and the kinds of films that he made, and \"Ten Minutes to Live,\" in that context, has suffered badly. It is clear now that the film is a failed narrative; in fact, two narratives drawn from an alleged short story collection entitled \"Harlem After Midnight.\" The tales are called \"The Faker\" and \"The Killer\" and the front title promises three stories, but the film delivers only two. Perhaps Micheaux' later film \"Harlem After Midnight\" constitutes the third story not shown here. In any event, Micheaux never published these stories and it is difficult to make out from this film what exactly the narrative was.", "Time has not brought us a better print, and the one we have shows the telltale intrusions of censorship. In the first story, a fellow who claims to be a wealthy producer or something-or-other turns on the charm with several women. He tells one singer he can only pay her $3.25 a day to appear in a talking picture, and that appears to have been about the daily budget that Micheaux had to make \"Ten Minutes to Live.\" There are so many ellipses and shortcuts that you can hardly tell a story is being told at all, and in the first part it so frequently interrupted by vaudeville acts and cutaways to non-speaking characters that you wonder who is actually participating in the tale told. The dancing, though, is all excellent, if not always shot to the best advantage, and in one scene the girls are crammed into a space so tight that they can barely move. Donald Heywood and his hard-working band are definitely an asset to the picture, even when their music is cut into little bits and shards, or interleaved with snatches of Beethoven symphonies. It is not completely foolproof, however; at one point a musician loses his music off the stand, and in yet another the whole band loses it place in the music, with the violinist diligently leading them back to the head.", "Despite the front title card's assertion that this is an \"All Talking\" picture, the second story, \"The Killer,\" is strictly a part-talkie, and plays for most of its length silent. One wonders if this was something Micheaux had made earlier as a silent and merely added to \"Ten Minutes to Live\" with a few talking scenes added. Overall, as a film it is far more interesting than the first part and contains several beautiful visual touches, but these are mostly in the silent filmed sections. Once the sound returns, conversation is heard while a character, ostensibly in hiding, is seen overhearing and reacting to it -- for a very long time.", "While \"Ten Minutes to Live\" is not Micheaux' best effort by a long shot, it is also not his worst, and it would be his weirdest if \"Swing!\" didn't exist. If you approach it as a kind of arty affair and enjoy the dancing and music, you still might get something out of it. If you try to follow \"Ten Minutes to Live\" as a conventional story, however, you will get hopelessly lost. Not all actors are credited, and some are here credited incorrectly; some appear to be playing more than one part in the story, and there are lots of silent-style subtitles and letters to make things all the more mystifying."]},

Therefore, it came as a complete surprise at the end of the movie, the amount of emotion I felt. So I think the film succeeded in drawing emotions that I wasn't even sure were there, perhaps it is the empathy we feel for ourselves and each other."]},

Director Antoine Fuqua has done an admirable job of making this movie about a rookie cop who gets into a lot more than he bargained for while on a day with a senior rogue detective to prove he's got what it takes to be a narc. Denzel Washington is fantastic as twisted but charismatic Detective Alonzo Harris who takes a big departure from his good guy roles to play the villain in this one. Washington has show over and over again that he's a talented actor. Well he continues to prove just that in Traning Day and then some. Ethan Hawke is equally impressive as rookie cop Jake Hoyt who finds himself in one increasingly dangerous situation after another. Hawke holds his own against Washington on screen and he may not have the flashier role but he goes a very good job as the hero in this film. The rest of the supporting cast including Scott Glenn, Cliff Curtis, Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, and a brief appearance by Tom Berenger are solid in their roles but none of them are given much to do and are merely given extended cameos. They still prove to be effective none the less in their brief screen time. The music seemed to sync very well with what was happening on the screen and the tone of the film. The brutal action violence is well executed but the showdown between Washington and Hawke near the end did get a bit unrealistic. It was still intense though and the two actors really got to show their off their acting chops in this movie. The vulgar language did get a bit much at times but the good more than outweighs the bad in this one. Despite some flaws Training Day is an entertaining action crime thriller with great performances from Hawke and especially Washington who make this movie definitely worth the time to watch."]},

The fly in the ointment is that Eastwood's nose for the truth leads him to believe the man is innocent of the crime. Eastwood portrays a very flawed character who is a womanizer, an irresponsible father and a reformed drunk. These chinks in his armor become apparent as he goes about the business of trying to ferret out the facts that he hopes will lead to the prisoner's exoneration. The performances are uniformly excellent. Washington distinguishes himself as a man facing death as he subtly reveals the pain and anguish seething just beneath the surface. Lisa Gay Hamilton (currently burning up the screen in TV's \"The Practice\") will break your heart as Washington's wife. On the minus side, Eastwood is getting a little long in the tooth to be paired with some of the young actresses he is shown with here. In addition, the climax is a bit cliched and mechanical, but strangely satisfying. The race to the midnight execution is a bit reminiscent of the film-within-a-film in Robert Altman's \"The Player\". Only in that film it was meant to be slightly tongue-in-cheek. These faults aside, \"True Crime\" will keep your attention even though you might be correctly predicting what will happen next.

Sure, it has all of the required trappings present in these filthy little crime films: there are rapes, violent robberies, shoot-outs, hostage situations, suicides, drugs, orgies, prostitutes, and squad cars racing down the streets with their tyres squealing and their horns blaring. These are all filmed perfectly well and give the film a classic '70s feel. Yet, on top of that, there's a main story of how vice, sleaze and corruption are rife in the city of Turin, and which shows how a middle-aged cop and his reporter friend attempt to clean up the rackets and get to the bottom of things.", "Inevitably it's a downbeat story, but there are nevertheless some highs, especially a uniquely original climax – I haven't seen the like anywhere else in this genre, and it's a good one. Enrico Maria Salerno (THE BIRD WITH THE CRYSTAL PLUMAGE) is well cast as the ageing hero, a cop with heart problems troubled by the lack of morals he sees everywhere around him. He really gets us on side from the beginning so that we end up rooting for him. His foil is sometime director Luciano Salce, who supplies a lot of cynical comic relief to the proceedings.", "The lovely Francoise Fabian pops up in a supporting role, leaving the viewer entranced by her beauty every time she appears. Weirdly, some of the film appears to have been played for laughs, and it's not sure whether this was true of the original, or whether it's the fault of the dubbing. It makes for a sometimes unwieldy combination of drama and chuckles. Director Romolo Guerrieri works hard, though, and in the end his efforts pay off. CITY UNDER SIEGE is unusual enough to be distinguishable from the dozens of other cops-and-robbers flicks filling Italian cinemas in the 1970s."]},

This is the reason. In my film class in high school we were shown this film and several of his films.The result was a life long passion for the man and his movies. The film is an interview done at the time of Stroszek, it has Herzog talking about each film, talking about their creation and what he hoped to achieve. Its the director explaining his films in a way that enlightens on more than just a cinematic level. Herzog not only talks about his films but also his larger ideas about what film is, both fiction and documentary. One of the reasons this film is so powerful is that we get some of the more hypnotic scenes from his films, the decent in Aguirre, The procession from Even Dwarfs Started Small, the volcano that wouldn't blow up, and on and on, all explained by the man himself, all hung out so that their beauty might tempt us to dive deeper into his back catalog. The result is that we get a greater appreciation for what we are seeing in the films he talks about and cinema itself. Its magic. Its the best sort of documentary, the subject in his own words. Its one of the best (filmmaker) portraits I've seen and an interesting companion piece to Herzog's My Best Friend, where Herzog once again talks about his films, though with a bend toward his Klaus Kinski films. This film will help you understand what he is doing better than any other film, article or book. If you love films you need to see this, more so if you love the films of Werner Herzog.

However, the closeness of the images disturbed many Victorian era people who felt a kiss was a private moment and should not be seen in public.

This is because the translator wanted to keep the French names that most fans would have been familiar with (since the Hungarian localization of the Dragon Ball franchise was originally based on the badly translated French version licensed by AB Groupe), only making slight corrections to them. This makes the dub very inconsistent.", "Featured in ", " (2005)", "There are many complaints against DragonBall GT. Many people complain about the lack of characters who get things to do, the lack of favourite characters from the first two series, and the mix of styles from the first two series. The first DragonBall was a very comedic show that centered around Goku growing up as a child, while DragonBall Z introduced many new characters, evolved the existing ones and took itself a lot more seriously. Both shows worked fine in their individual styles, but did feel slightly contrasting next to each other.", "DragonBall GT is also disregarded by many fans, as the series original creator did not work on this series other than having the job of character consultant.", "But looking past the complaints, and regarding it as a series in it's own right, DragonBall GT is very fine. The first step it takes is noticeable - reducing Goku back to the state of a child. The second is probably more noticeable - reducing the regular cast list to only 3; only two of which were favourites from DragonBall Z. In later episodes, an all new fourth party is also added - Gil, a robot who swallowed the Dragon Radar from the original series - unfortunately, he generally slows things down, but at least there has been innovation, which is commendable.", "What this series does - and very successfully, it's worth noting - is consistently merge the comedic DragonBall with the action-laden DragonBall Z. Everyone is a winner here, even if their favourite style is not featured as much as in their favourite of the two original series. Reducing Goku to a child was a sensible move, as it allowed fans of the original who drifted during Z's adult-Goku to become interested in the series with the character they knew and loved again. The series utilises it's license to the fullest - resurrecting Emporer Pilaf from the original series (noticeably absent from DragonBall Z), and recreating the importance of the DragonBalls (who were generally merely aesthetic in DragonBall Z). The series also introduces the character of Pan - who showed a lot of potential at the end of DragonBall Z. Perhaps the most controversial aspect of the show, Pan does take up a lot of the screen time, but her character is a direct descendant of Bulma from the original series (despite family tree relations), with the role of 'growing up' given to Goku in DragonBall and Gohan in DragonBall Z.", "The series is not perfect, however. Early episodes are generally unengaging, with sometimes uninteresting villains and often farcical situations. The early episodes seem to focus mostly on the DragonBall style over the DragonBall Z one - and because of this the series feels alienated to those who have only experienced DBZ (which is probably a large percentage of the fanbase). Animation has dropped noticeably in quality from DragonBall Z - feeling a bit more 'clunky' and hard-edged. Character re-designs are generally awful; Vegeta starts off the series with a moustache, Gohan's glasses now dominate his face, Trunks has been given an odd suit that really can't be categorised, and Krillin is almost completely unrecogniseable from the first series.", "On a redeeming note, though, some character redesigns are good - Pan's costume suits the feel of the show, and Bulma looks exactly the same as in DBZ, save a few wrinkles. Goten also looks great as the skinny teenager, and his role is well written. Hercule also looks much better than expected with a bald patch.", "Fans of DBZ will be disappointed that many of the characters are left out of the action - Gohan, Goten and others seemingly never get to fight at all, or do anything of utmost importance. Krillin is annoyingly underused, but he was becoming like that in DragonBall Z as well. Yamcha, again, is noticeably missing. And most surprisingly, Vegeta gets considerably less screen-time in DBZ - though of all the supporting cast, he probably does the most, so it's not all bad.", "So what is DragonBall GT? It's a decidedly mixed bag - many good features, and many bad. But as a series in it's own right, it is very good, and a few steps above many other action animes that have all action and barely any substance. The light humour adds a lot, too, and feels very much a part of the DragonBall continuity. And because of the linked styles from the first two series, which works very well in the later episodes, the series really does take on a new perspective, and truly does feel like a DragonBall series. It's not perfect, but for fans of the series it's more of the same - repetitive fight after repetitive fight, with Hercule throwing in some overused (but still welcome) cameos here and there.", "A good follow up, if not perfect. Definitely worth investing in if a fan of either original series - or if DBZ left you begging for more - which it did for many people."]},

I am not sure the show would work as well with guests more different from Lurie (though Matt Dillon, chosen by the Japanese backers, does not fit the mold), but the guests often do not seem to be enjoying themselves. In the commentary, Lurie says he is afraid that if the skipper of the shark boat, a real fisherman who never appears on camera visually or by voice, ever sees the show \"He will beat me up.\" His guest on Episode 2, Tom Waits, would not talk to Lurie for 2 years after filming and has never seen the show. Yet later guests Dillon and Hopper saw the completed first two episodes, loved them, agreed to come on the show, and had more or less the same things happen to them (though Hopper clearly had fun). Fishing is fishing. Sometimes the scenery compensates for all else.", "Stumbling across this \"TV series\" on real broadcast TV would be a life-changing experience.

Not only did the movie report accurate events, but it did so in a really emotional way. Some shots were in-your-face intense. There is this one where the kid Kenny feels really sad because his friend is going to get molested, and there's this close up on him and he's really a good actor so it seems totally realistic.

Sadowitz is one of the most brilliant comedians on the planet, but, of all the ones I've seen- and I've seen hundreds on both sides of the Atlantic- this Scottish/Jewish comedian is the most offensive.

The difference being, what with this a Lovitz comedy special, he is lampooning himself and the genre. What would you call this, a mockudrama? At any rate, the episode had a sort of Damn Yankees feel to it. It centered on a baseball player, something about if he slides into home he will die from an old head injury, and, naturally, he must make up his mind at the end of the play whether or not to slide headfirst into home to win the game. He does and I can't remember what happens, which pretty much sums up this show. Which is not to say the show didn't have it's moments. At the top of the show Lovitz tells a row of illustrious directors, Rob Reiner, Ron Underwood, et. al., that if they see anything they like during the play simply pick up the phone in front of them and it would ring a phone on the stage. During dramatic moments Lovitz would gesture to the directors and the phone. When the phone would ring, it was always to offer work to someone other than Lovitz.

Interesting how they list all the actors as themselves. As I recall they almost all played characters in the play. Not worth checking out, but at half an hour, not too painful."]},

It was a good, groundbreaking telenovela at the time, offering a rare glimpse at life in Brazil's more remote areas, usually ignored by the big productions. For that alone and educating the public in the traditions of the area, it was remarkable. The performances were not bad either. Now, in retrospect, this hour long five times week \"soap opera\" boasts a stellar cast of what became legendary actors in Brazil, including Vera Fischer, and the incomparable Fernanda Montenegro, in a wonderful typically regional character. If you understand Spanish, don't miss it. The synchronization (that's dubbing in all other languages but English) is outstanding. Spanish and Portuguese are very close anyway.

It's so terrible that it's a severe case of a film that don't have salvation, no, I won't try to see it again. Ever!", "\"Aleluia, Gretchen\" (\"Hallelujah, Gretchen\") promises a lot with a plot about the rise of a Nazist group in the south of Brazil, initiated by Germans who transfered themselves in the 1930's and decided to put Hitler's ideals in the South America. Director Sylvio Back isn't failing with the truth in choosing the South as the scenery for such plot since there were initiatives like those and still are predominant there; the problem with the script is of a higher order, or better the lack of order. Nothing makes sense, the characters aren't involving, they don't talk one single quote that makes sense, everything is so useless. Plenty of conversations that go nowhere ruin the movie just as much as presenting the Hitler Youth training and praising the man but you never watch them making anything, no attacks, no persecutions, preaching the desire of battling on a war but never doing anything similar. OK, one can argue that I didn't wait to see the whole thing but that's no excuse, the movie didn't go nowhere, confused me, bored me and it was completely worthless. Mr. Back can open his film showing all the minor awards the film got but that didn't impressed me, I bet all those critics and juror were laughing at him for making one of the worst films ever made.", "I shouldn't put my expectations high for a Brazilian picture made in the 1970's (with no doubt, the worst decade for those movies, I haven't found one 10 star from that period) but there's so much more this could have been. The only admirable thing about it is its small challenge to the dictatorship current at the time, and it makes me wonder how a plot about a subversive group in Brazil was approved by the censors (the regime wouldn't allow something like that), who also didn't cut the first sequence involving the Youth's training with all the boys playing soccer, running and swimming, and in all of those scenes they were completely naked. I've never quite understood the censors criteria for cutting nude scenes from some films and allowing others like this go on without any problem.", "With some social denounce and a few good ideas to present and this would be a decent film.

Similarities between these two films are striking as both of them belong to the same category of cross-dressing comedy and what more fascinating, both of the titles are from the same year (1959). The first one shows us a current (1950s) world of girls' school and garrison in an idyllic Finnish town whereas the latter one allows history to soften themes a bit. In both films there are three major characters: two men whose masculinity is under review, and a woman, who is like a sexual angel.", "In Wilder's film the distinction between two major male character is shown as possibility to change the identity role, and Some like it hot even gives us a great laugh of a couple of millionaire and transvestite (\"woman\"), while in Tarkas' farce the much greater fear of homosexuality is handled quite openly. The transvestite theme is only like a token idiom. Happy end is more open in Wilder's film than in Tarkas' as the main characters end up in opposite possibilities: in first one impossible end and in second one totally accepted, but obviously most improbable.", "Both films include musical elements, but very different ways: Wilder puts music to be an integral part of his masterpiece while Tarkas uses some popular singers in his title without any need. I mean that music in this Finnish farce could be better in few moments, but otherwise all the things seems to fit rarely well. Tarkas' Vatsa sisään, rinta ulos! gives us excellent characters - perhaps even more than Wilder in his film -, and marvellously played. Helge Herala's neurotic officer also allows us allusions of Hynkel from Charles Chaplin's The great dictator...", "Surprisingly good, if we forget the overage schoolgirls and like that.

This is not to say it's a bad film. Quite on the contrary; it's excellent. It's slow-paced without being long-winded, subtle without being elitist, understated without being incomprehensible, and ever so elegant. This is particularly true for the love scene that highlights the final third of the film. No gratuitous nudity and full-on sex in this film; instead you get an older man teaching his uneducated wet nurse how to write and looking at the way she holds her pen in a way that just sizzles with passion. It's an old-fashioned way of depicting lust, but it's more erotic than any 'steaming' sex scene Hollywood could concoct. And that's just one of the many instances of understatement that make this film so impressive.", "The acting, too, is top-notch - subtle but ever so effective. None of the three leading characters (the doctor, his wife, and their wet nurse) undergoes much development, but somehow the actors (particularly Valeria Bruni Tedeschi as the frigid wife with the smouldering passion underneath) give one the impression they do. It's an achievement not to be underestimated.", "Of course there are things the makers of this film could learn from Hollywood, one of them being how to use lamps. The first few minutes of the film are so dark (one can barely see facial expressions) it makes one wish the job had been done by a Hollywood crew. Once one gets into the story, however, the natural light and gaslight become a part of the experience, making for an authentic nineteenth-century Italian atmosphere.

Like Harold Pinter's play \"Betrayal\" (turned into an excellent film in 1983)\nthe story is told backwards so we meet both couples into adulthood and move all the way back when they were youngsters in 1964 before the military coup, and the movie\nalternates every two years in between problems and happiness in their marriage and sex life.", "Interesting way to see the story and how the unsual progress of events in shown in a reverse way but quite ineffective in what it has to say or show. The majority of\ndialogues don't allow the characters to be seen in a mature way, they argue with themselves mostly about matters of sex, fantasies and unfulfilled desires rather than\nfinding ways to connect themselves with emotions or sharing a life together (sure, sex is important but it's not the ultimate key for a loving and healthy relationship).", "Their conversations about feelings and connection with each other are too weak and simple-minded with questionings about having an orgasm during childbirth (but Fagundes\nreply to that thought by Torloni was hilarious) or challenging each other with political questionings like Glória and Wilker couple do.", "I couldn't connect with those characters despite the many humored situations and attempts to humor since there's no balancing of good and honest romance, for both\ncouples, neither the one formed by Giulia and Betti, which is a couple that disintegrates without much of a reasoning if seeing the story in the linear format since\nthey're hot and horny for each other and then it just died (but it's a valid point made where just one factor can't keep a couple united). The main focus of the\nrelationships is permeated with talks about sex and some little action right from the beginning where a couple creates a fantasy of a bandit trying to take advantage of a\nnun but the man fails at the right time. The lines aren't funny, and most of them come across as vulgar, cheap and it's basic teenage talk even when they're grown up.", "Does the movie worth of your time? Perhaps. I won't complain about the acting, everybody has their own unique charm while playing those lost and confused characters\nand even when they play the teenage versions they're acceptable and slightly believable despite being in their late 30's/early 40's. It doesn't feel like a deceitful act,\nand it's funny. Main problem is the script that feels and is empty, imature, with hardly a valuable thought to share about relationships, intimacy and closeness, it might\nhave two or three good thoughts about the value of friendship - and I like that since the quartet never changed to infidelity. It doesn't feel like a grown up person\nwrote the script, it was like teenager having memories about the times he lived and then fantasizing about his future years: there's plenty of imagination but they fail\nto be concrete or good enough as a reality. 4/10."]},

This makes Noltenius Brothers quite special - as the last of the twelve German films which received its premiere between January 1 and the capitulation of Germany on May 7, 1945. To be precise, another film - Via Mala - received it's first public showing on the same day (in the small town of Mayrhofen, where the filming took place, but no longer made it to the cinemas until 1948). So, exactly one month before Day Zero, there was a good day for German cinema.", "The Noltenius Brothers is exactly what you would imagine it to be: very serious, sombre, dignified; a story about honor and duty and responsibility. Everything is played out indoors (as it was, by the late 1944, rather difficult to film anything outdoors and still try to hide the fact there's a war on), in an old patrician household, which serves as a reminder of an era that would be gone forever any moment. It's a \"modern\" film (meaning the action supposedly takes place in the present), but the whole story-line would have worked better, had the setting been changed to say, late 1800s - we get a bunch of very dignified gentlemen of the town council having very dignified meetings; at home there is a rather boring mousey little hausfrau, supposedly torn by some inner emotions when meeting again 'the other brother' whom she did not marry some twenty years ago. What makes it interesting, is, of course, the fact that we are seeing 1945 - but a warped, fun-house mirror version of that year, where there is no war, people are dancing and lingering in deep thoughts at the grand pianos, as if in a frozen dream. The atmosphere is similar to Opfergang (1944), in itself a much more interesting film (and in color).", "This poor film only managed to stay in cinemas (those, that were still standing) for a week or so, as the battle for Berlin with it's brutal door-to-door combat began the very next week. So I believe that for many warn-torn people in Berlin, who were never sure if they would live to see the next morning, this must have been their final escape room from the grim realities outside."]},

The close ups and vicous laughs are there, and so are the hill gunfights and the wide open scenes of a lone horseman, and there are even a duel and bar brawl! Besides that, it is a revenge story against violent outlaws. This typical Western is, however, also very Brazilian, both in the soundrack and in the background - a violence practiced by cangaceiros (besides the one by \"volantes\", the policemen who beheaded cangaceiros after killing them). The usage of dissonant sounds and slow trembling camera movements were a skillful way to portray the suffering in the brutal offense in the beginning (avoiding spoiler here...). The dynamics between the cangaceiros is also nice, exploring each one as an unique individual despite being a somewhat homogeneous group. The reactions of the only female cangaceira in the film are also meaningful (and what means being a woman in that environment), and so are the common people's attitudes. The title is somewhat misleading, as the feud is not against famous Lampião band, but against outlaws, lead my Moita Brava, who survived the historical ambush. The are cangaço films in which cangaceiros are (anti) heroes and thi are other movies in which they are contradictory human beings. This Northeastern is none of them: here they are as evil as the black-hatted gunslingers in Hollywood Old West and as the dirty scarfaces in spaghetti Westerns. Besides well filmed and acted, music is good and dialogs are excellent. Carlos Coimbra made an authoral cinema in the 60's that worth seeing."]},

In the early 1980s, Massaccesi directed several cheap porn films, but using the pseudonym Alexandre Borsky. Why, then, did he use the name Joe D'Amato in countless irrelevant adult videos, such as this \"Carmen\" (1996)? Career contempt? I don't know.", "Carmen - La Zoccola Spagnola is a horrible porn video. First of all, this video has nothing to do with the famous Carmen by Prosper Mérimée and Georges Bizet. By the way, neither story or plot this video has. Why did D'Amato waste time on productions without plot or narrative? In Carmen there is only a succession of sex scenes staged without enthusiasm and inspiration and which basically boil down to fellatio and vaginal penetration. In the entire video there is only a brief moment of double penetration, which makes this video a nightmare for all female sodomy lovers.", "As was customary in Italian productions of that period, in Carmen there are no Italian actresses (the cast is formed by Hungarian and Slavic actresses, for the most part). Only Maria de Sanchez is Spanish and she is wasted here as she was very beautiful and talented. In short, Carmen is one of the worst porn videos of the 90s."]},

There's one masterful sequence where are drunk walks out into the streets, his head spinning and stumbles into the streets.

It is touching to see how Giovanni respects the books and sees the importance of education contrasting in a counterpoint with the feelings of his reckless brother. The screenplay is divided in six chapters (\"arrivals\", \"deceptions\", \"money\", \"letters\", \"blood\" and \"families\") and uses ellipsis, jumping through the years and leaving many situations unresolved as if they were kept in secret.

DEVLIN was loosely based on the motorcycle daredevil stuntman Evel Knieval. The synopsis of the story consisted of the Devlins. They were a trio of orphans who supported themselves through their daredevil motorcycle act. The lead character and support figure,Ernie Devlin(Michael Bell)was a 22-year old professional stuntman who drove the motorcycle and the car during the stunts while his younger brother,teenager Tod(Mickey Dolenz) oversaw the mechanical work and designed routines for Ernie's acts. Ernie's kid sister,11-year old Sandy(Michele Robinson)basically provided assistance and support whenever she was needed,plus other additional duties. They work,lived and travel on the highways and byways of the country in their huge Winnebago motor home as part of a traveling circus. Hank(Norman Alden),the owner of the circus in which they worked,served as a surrogate father figure whenever Ernie or his teenager brother or kid sister needed support and guidance during troubled times.", "Interspersed with some of the stunts along with the hair-raising thrills and high adventure along with some interpersonal drama were tips on motorcycle safety(given by Ernie himself)to let young viewers know the Devlin's occupation and to let them know about using the proper equipment when riding a motorcycle as well. Out of the 17 episodes that this show produced,DEVLIN had plenty of risks and cliffhanging suspense that came along with the territory. Also to point out,and since this was a Saturday Morning animated cartoon aimed at pre-teenagers and older kids under 12 years of age,DEVLIN was ABC's answer (or Hanna-Barbera)to cash in on the craze of Evel Knieval(who was in 1974 at the peak of his fame),and the whole motorcycle fad of the early and mid-1970's along with cashing in on the huge popularity of the Japanese-produced animated series Speed Racer(which became a HUGE HIT during the 1970's when it was shown in syndicated repeats). The original episodes ran as part of ABC's Sunshine Saturday Morning schedule from September 7, 1974 until August 30, 1975. After its run on Saturday Mornings,ABC moved to Sunday Mornings in repeated episodes from September 7, 1975 until its last telecast on February 15, 1976."]},

Halfway between the unbridled fantasy of the James Bond saga and the ruthless toughness of 'The Spy Who Came In from the Cold', Molinaro's first foray into the world of espionage (he would return to the genre six years later with 'Peau d'espion') is very much a product of its time, quite pleasant if not revolutionary.", "Based on an obscure novel by Fred Noro, the plot is as embroiled as a spy story should be, one of the pleasures of the viewer being to try and unravel the tangle it forms. The whole thing revolves around a certain Andrei Smoloff, the cultural attaché at the Soviet Embassy, from whom reputedly undecipherable documents have been stolen. Has the diplomat simply been imprudent or is he a traitor to his motherland preparing to defect to the West ? Such is the question to which both Borghine, the Chief of the Soviet Services, and Captain Jean de Lursac accompanied by his teammate Vigo, two agents of the French Intelligence, try to figure out an answer, each on their own. It goes without saying that before the riddle is solved we will have been witness to the fierce struggle waged between the French, Soviet and American counter-espionage, their objective in the circumstances of the story being to trace Smoloff and to be the first to get their hands on the missing documents. ", "Nothing startlingly new in all that for sure but the film is well put together, skilfully combining fast-paced rhythm, humor and an ounce of gravity. The same thing could be said about the \"buddy cop movie\" gimmick the film rests on: it can hardly be called original as we know from the very first minute that the two teammates will be at each other's throats throughout their mission while remaining inseparable! But the duo works well and a good time in their company is guaranteed. Anyway, once admitted that \"Les ennemis\" does not break new ground it proves commendable for other reasons, the main one being the serious way it deals with its subject, even if it is in a light tone most of the time : the members of the various intelligence services all speak their own language ; the day-to-day operations of these services, whether French or foreign, are described realistically, without resorting Bond- like gadgets; and best of all, the stress is laid on what could bring antagonistic countries (France and the USSR in this particular case) closer together rather than the opposite as is wont in such a codified genre. Another good point is the director's propensity to dot his narrative with a multitude of details, unrelated with action or secondary to it, but which enrich it delicately. It goes from Gerlier (the boss of the gang) feeding the ducks, to Lemoine (the young hoodlum) swatting a fly while giving a phone call, to a totally gratuitous cameo by director Claude Chabrol as a gym instructor, to the appendage of colorful secondary characters (de Lursac's snobbish mother, the counter- espionage doctor played by... comedian Jean Lefebvre!)", "One final thing to keep in mind is Molinaro's light touch when it comes to the things of love and sex. He is at his best when he describes the relationship that binds Jean (Roger Hanin) and Christine (Pascale Audret): tenderness laced with humor, adult but discreet eroticism; the few scenes involving the couple are full of charm. Nothing to do with the brazen exhibition of flesh de rigueur in this kind of flicks. All in all, a watchable little film, benefiting from a slick direction and fluid editing. It is rather suspenseful, quite entertaining (witticisms burst forth throughout), well-played (as interpreted by the excellent Michel Vitold, the character of Smoloff is more than one- dimensional), graced with an efficient jazzy score... More than one alleged masterpiece cannot boast as much."]},

However that is where the similarity ends since the story, as written by the illustrious Federico Gamboa, develops into what seems a bona fide Greek tragedy. Two men, Ramón and Gerardo, are brothers who have known Pilar, the woman they both love, since childhood. The brothers are very serious about their love and intentions for Pilar but she is not so sure of her own feelings. The Mexican Revolution breaks out and both brothers go to fight in the front but, after a while, Ramón, plays a trick on his brother, deserts the army, and returns home to pursue his seduction of Pilar. Meanwhile, in the background there is the wailing Soledad, a mysterious woman who might be alive or dead but whose presence casts a shadow of doom over all.", "While Geraldo becomes a hero of the Revolution, Pilar realizes that she is really in love with Ramón and marries him. Of course, that is not the end of the story because after that Gerardo will show up when you least expect it and Pilar tries some witchcraft from Soledad. You will surely be treated to more suspense, mystery and shock but I don´t want to spoil it for you. The cast of \"Entre hermanos\" was assembled from some of the greatest actors in Mexican cinema who were also favorites of the public. Pedro Armendáriz, Rafael Baledón, José Elías Moreno, etc. are all very good, but I would like to highlight the performances of the lead females Carmen Montejo, Anita Blanch and Isabela Corona. Those ladies turn out excellent performances, the kind that stays with you long after watching the film.", "\"Entre hermanos\" takes place in rural Mexico at the beginning of the 20th Century and veteran cinematographer Jack Draper gives us images that transports us to the precise place and time. There are a few precious moments of visual excellence like the dance of \"sowing seeds on the soil\" by a group of female dancers wearing typical Indian customs. The sequence was artfully shot and is simply enchanting. I just hope this film gets the attention it deserves from cultural institutions such as Mexico´s UNAM, and from the home video industry. Maybe someday we can enjoy \"Entre hermanos\" digitally remastered and restored to the way it was originally conceived and filmed by director Ramón Peón and his crew."]},

However, it's not spectacular or much thoroughly thought through since\nit leaves viewers slightly alienated knowing less about poetess and activist Patrícia Galvão (Pagú) than what they need to know about her. She was a\ntrailblazer in many accounts, she was part of the vanguart of artists from the Modernism alongside poet Oswald de Andrade (Antonio Fagundes) and painter\nTarsila do Amaral (Ester de Góes); she wore trousers which was considered a scandal for women to wear in the 1920's; and a staunch supporter of the\nComunist Party of Brazil spreading its message and supporting Communism outside of Brazil as well, for which she went to jail many times during her lifetime.", "Those aspects of her life as an artist and activist are nicely translated to the screen but the movie falters a bit when due to its lack of more depth in her\nlife and some artistic license that doesn't appeal as much as we wanted.", "I enjoyed the performances, specially Carla Camurati as Pagú, one of the best performances from Brazilian films and she seems as if born to play that role;\nand Fagundes is a charm as Oswald, her first husband and great companion on the arts; and also the great Otávio Augusto as her second husband. Had the film\nincluded more factual information with a more consistent script, this would have been a better film than it is. I felt lost at times, thinking that the\ngreat result, the importance of it all was just to shown a woman ahead of her time fighting for equal rights and just provoking society with her artistry and activism when\nin fact Pagú was more than that. She left several writings and works that should have a place in the film instead of the heavy focus in her arrests and time in\njail - in one of those moments her challenge to refuse shaking hands with governor Ademar de Barros is one of the most interesting and pivotal moments when she gets more\nsix months of jail just for doing that. So, I wanted to know more about her work, just like the play she acts when she goes from being booed to receive a standing\novation while performing \"Eh Pagú Eh\" (there's a rare short documentary with that title, which I also wrote about it some years ago).", "I guess that viewers who don't know anything about her this film is an important one but bear in mind that many licenses were taken; as for those who know her more\nit might be disappointing or not that good. I enjoyed seeing her life story and considering the time it was made it ends up being a nice cinebiography. The time recreation\nwas a prime, the acting is very good and there are things to enjoy and learn with Pagú's story. I'll give it a good note and a pass since it was Norma's first film, she had\na solid career as an actress (small role here as the Communist friend of Pagú in Paris) and landed such a big project was a new challenge for her. Kudos for that. 6/10."]},

When she meets him he is down-and-out but she quickly recognises that his good looks and athletic physique mark him out as an ideal 'escort' for wealthy women 'd'un certain age'. This doesn't work out too well to say the least! War intervenes and upon his return their 'friendship' continues. He meets the lovely Dominique of Nicole Courcel and when he tells Alice of his intention to marry she turns on him with the utmost venom.......... The best scenes of course are between Marchal and Arletty. He is a hunk who can also act as is proved in his films for Bunuel and she brings her own particular magic and air of mystery to every part she plays. Their final confrontation is as powerful as it is unexpected and wonderfully done. Courcel is deeply touching as the woman who offers him a chance of happiness. Philippe Agostini is behind the camera and there is an excellent score by Henri Verdun. I can only add my voice to those of previous reviewers who have lamented Richebé's undeserved neglect."]},

Shindo penned many a great film for Masumura, but this time we have more of a mixed bag. The depiction of the man in the middle is just one more film about a \"dead doctor\". Nothing new to the genre. The women are much stronger as characters. This is a movie you would just love to show Sigmund Freud and hear his thoughts about the characters. There is initially a bit of a lesbian subtext, as Wakao agrees to marry to the doctor's family, because she is so impressed by Takamine's beauty. Quickly, however, they become rivals of the doctor's attention. Both want to be the most important woman for him, and they both offer themselves as test subjects when the doctor starts developing his risky formula.", "As you would expect from Masumura, there is critique against feudal family values. The film gives both women a little sympathy, and shows how difficult it is to be a woman in any age, in a system centered around men. Takamine is good and restrained as the mother-in-law, secretly wise and conducting herself masterfully. Wakao plays the character through whom we as the audience enter this family. Her reaction shots and gradual character build-up were the best thing in the film. Even in a lesser Masumura work, this actress elevates the material.", "For me, the film was not one of Masumura's better works, his standards being really high. It is well shot, and knows the story it wants to tell, but I found it a little dull often, and also the bleak atmosphere forms a very large gray mass where individual moments fail to make an impact. Also I am not okay with animal cruelty in films, even when it's done to establish historical accuracy. There are movies that are a lot worse in this regard, but I would anyway not recommend this to cat-lovers."]},

That's it as far as plot goes, cueing a series of repetitious sex scenes before the money comes through and the gals save the day. (Is that a spoiler?)", "Like a lot of Stevens' early work, this is barely above the level of a one-day wonder (probably 2-4 days at most). Trading out that genre's usual 16mm for 35, what Stevens gains in professionalism he quickly squanders on some of the saddest, most threadbare sets this side of a housing renovation. Every room in the film has about two pieces of décor, set out against endless, brightly-colored monochromatic expanses of wall that just scream soundstage. Again, if you ask John or Jane Q. Public to describe a classic porn film, this would probably match perfectly, and while it's not the greatest aesthetic deficit to overcome (dime store surrealists like Rinse Dream and Gregory Dark have worked wonders on stagey backdrops), it remains sad and drab in comparison to the work an early Damiano was able to conjure on presumably comparable budgets.", "As for the sex, like most early Stevens pics, it's perfunctory but enthusiastically shot. Genre stalwart Eric Edwards makes a couple appearances sporting an unfortunate mustache, while frequent two-for-one combo Bree Anthony and Tony Richards are here as well, delivering what is probably some of the film's best action (there's something to be said for couples' chemistry) in a fairly early screen appearance for the both of them. Always an enthusiastic sex director, Stevens digs in with his camera in many of these scenes, providing explicit gynecological angles that should delight fans.", "It's clear from these early flicks (where it's all they have going for them) that Stevens was engaged with this element of the action, and it's nice to at least see a director deliver enthusiastic porn, even if his film isn't interested in anything else. Thankfully, Stevens would begin to venture into more ambitious (and slightly higher-budgeted) territory the following year with ROLLERBABIES (while still slumming it with snoozers like TEENAGE TWINS), so it's nice to see he was eventually able to bring his artistic ambitions in line with his erotic ones. Nevertheless, HIGHWAY HOOKERS marks a point where he still hadn't reached that level of development. It may be of interest to some as a career footnote, but is largely for fans only."]},

It was better than average due to casting many top femme beauties, six in the original version and eight to 10 or 11 (counting insert doubles) in the mutilated one.", "Simple-minded story has meek Matt Hewitt in the enviable position of working in an office with Rene Bond, but sexually frustrated. After rear-end tracking images of Uschi Digard who he tails walking to work, Rene catches Hewitt with dirty magazines and makes fun of him.", "At this point the movie in available form begins to literally fall apart due to the alterations. Hewitt's mean boss John Barnum calls Rene into his office and we are treated to extreme closeups of him getting a blow-job, under his desk. At this point the film is not suspect so we assume (wrongly I believe) that Bond is in her hardcore assignment mode.", "Uschi waiting to be interviewed by Barnum for a job gets extremely angry with Hewitt for no reason, a cryptic and out-of-character scene for the buxom superstar, but then she and Rene are called in for the interview. Bond flashes a beaver shot at Hewitt to rile him up before seeing the boss, so horny Matt pulls a dirty magazine from his drawer and the movie diverges altogether.", "Inserted is a very lengthy sequence, which I would date as shot approximately in 1975 (dating the re-edited version) of a three-some featuring Frisco talent John Seeman, Joan Devlon (wearing her signature index-finger jade ring) and a bleached blonde played by Monique Cardin. This talkie loop is stimulating hardcore and lulls the viewer into believing HONEY BUNS is a strictly XXX project, but the scene has nothing whatsoever to do with the rest of the film and even detracts from its central fantasy premise which has yet to be established.", "After viewing the entire 74-minute print I discovered that this added extraneous scene does a lot more than merely satisfying the fans of generic explicit sex footage (who dominate today's porn market, but were not yet in the ascendancy in the early '70s). ", "The pornographers who authored the \"new\" edit used this loop to replace entirely the Bond/Digard threesome scene in Barnum's office. All we see is the three of them leaving his office disheveled, and that's the last we see of the film's two marquee stars. As a result, in HONEY BUNS neither Bond nor Digard disrobes (Bond's beaver flash aside, a 1973 equivalent to Sharon Stone's immortal moment in BASIC INSTINCT), and Digard's role in particular is reduced to a cameo. Fans of either star are bound to be disappointed by this drastic decision to jettison good old soft-core content in favor of the trendy XXX (undoubtedly made in order to obtain bookings at the increasing number of adult theaters that had gone strictly hardcore).", "Film settles into its one-note fantasy mode after this with a vaguely hippie type Magician (wearing tux jacket and tie, bare chest under his vest and jeans) approaching Hewitt on the street after work to get him hooked on a magic pill that LSD-like will cause his sexual wishes to come to life.", "That sets into motion a parade of fabulous '70s porn starlets, all tantalizing Hewitt until a happy ending when he winds up in bed with four of them at once. Getting there is soft porn delight, of which Starlyn Simone pleasuring him in a bathtub is the highlight. However, nearly every sequence is \"enhanced\" by extreme closeup inserts of a couple of body doubles very poorly matched (to Simone, Sandy Carey, Kathy Hilton and Becky Sharpe) so that we can see explicit fellatio, cunnilingus or intercourse.", "The movie's premise that Hewitt is being teased and cannot get off by these appearing/then vanishing beauties is largely dropped in the urge to let his fingers do the walking in vaginas or his hard-on (obviously a male body double) do its thing. So the fans are left to ponder: is the urge to see gynecological closeups of genitals in penetration mode so important that all else in a film be disregarded?", "The answer is a resounding No from me - an okay skin flick has had its two leading ladies forcibly removed and the other equally beauteous actresses upstaged by some disembodied body parts. And I am a huge fan of Joan Devlon, but I'd rather see her perform in her own movie than be added to someone else's under false pretenses.", "I've seen many similar exercises in movie mutilation, notably quite a few '70s Italian releases where Ornella Muti, Sirpa Lane and Janet Agren were turned briefly into XXX- rated performers via non-matching body/face doubles. The pandering for the almighty lira (or dollar or euro) deserves the harshest criticism."]},

Not at all. This is a historical costume drama, with swashbuckling elements. The lovely Ms. Lee plays an innkeeper's daughter who marries an older French colonial official, but who is desired by a younger, attractive minor official. Maybe it's just this English-dubbed edition, but the editing/continuity is a bit strange here. In the middle of a scene, we jump to an awkwardly spliced-in scene of what is being discussed by the characters, then we cut back to the same place in the dialogue where we were and the dialogue continues! There are a few other awkward jumps in the film also. The main selling point of MARIE OF THE ISLES is Belinda Lee, and she is wonderful. Her premature death robbed the 60s film world of a lady who no doubt would have carved out a significant place in European genre films. If you are a fan, you'll want to see this film. If not, it's no masterpiece. There's more talk than action, and the light-hearted musical score would fit a film with circus clowns better than a historical drama. Somewhat hard to find--not in circulation in the usual genre-film circles."]},

Not tragic but a sentimental romance which grows from Adolescence to Maturity with realistic theories. Pathinaaru Vayathinile seemed quite like a mix-up of many old Hollywood and Bollywood films but it had its own original storyline while dealing the mainstream content. We have seen this formula before that a Teenage girl falls in love with a wrong man while her childhood buddy who is a true lover of her is always ignored by her. And then after getting abandoned by that wrong man she realises the true love of her childhood companion. Pathinaaru Vayathinile uses the same formula but keeps all the characters very original except for the heroin and that's fine because i don't think anybody could have done anything different with that character. It focuses on the strengths and vulnerabilities of Mayil, a 16-year-old schoolgirl, and the challenges she faces and overcomes. Sridevi plays 16 years old Mayil when she was actually 14 herself. But i didn't really see her that young, i mean the maturity when she speaks and the way she looks seemed like above 20 sometimes. I don't know why that happened to me but sorry i couldn't help saying this. Kamal Haasan as Chappanni is terrific. He is the best performer in this film, and very much credit of that goes to writing too as he was the only character in the film who had the highest scope. Rajinikanth plays an evil guy and he definitely looks one. 'How's this?', he asks. 'Very Good', i say. Bharathiraaja made an impressive debut, no doubts about that. 16 Vayathinile was the first Tamil film to be shot predominantly outdoors and yes that helped it very much because without that Real Village Layout, it might have lost that humour and realistic touch. Overall, a Classic Romance and you can call it tragic if you wish but i would rather call it a senti one.", "RATING - 8/10*", "By - #samthebestest."]},

While true the possibilities work in a balanced way for the director. His sympathy (and Fagundes' too as a protagonist) for the Workers Party in the episode that happened parallel to the 1982 elections in São Paulo - the first to have current Brazil's president Lula running for governor and which had André Franco Montoro as the elected governor - cannot be concealed. The film is the story of Davi Duarte, an idealistic reporter in search of the truth about the puzzling series of crimes in which prostitutes of the neighborhood of Brás are ripped, his clashes with the publisher of the newspaper on the approach adopted for the report - publisher played smoothly by Goulart de Andrade - that can't create a press of his dreams. But he can really help create a press of his nightmares, it seems. The police seems to be willing to make an agreement with the press. And the reporter runs the risk of being used by both to incriminate an innocent. They'd do everything so the culprit could be found. The streets are dirty, they need cleaning. And Davi Duarte starts a race against time to save a young prostitute called Luna, thought to be one of the next on the maniac's list. And to save an innocent from false conviction won't make it less hard for the reporter. Suggesting the use of the episode as a political springboard might not make A Próxima Vítima a rather political film. But for sure it is a film that is well made and built into frantic crescendo as the pursuit of the reporter gets tighter and tighter onto the real killer."]},

The new wife turns out to be frigid on their wedding night, and the couple have a big fight. The wife goes out of town to stay with her older, married sister (Ewa Aulin) and gets involved with her sister's jaded swinger friends. The husband consoles himself by picking up prostitutes and carrying on with a sexy, voluptuous neighbor (Femi Benussi) right in his new mother-in-law's villa. For some reason the mother-in-law considers this a turn-on and becomes sexually drawn to her loutish son-in-law. . .", "This is the kind of a movie that is very much of a certain time (the morally confused early 70's)and a certain place (Italy--where they REALLY seem to like to keep things in the family). The characters are kind of hard to relate to because they are either repressed virgins or jaded \"la dolce vita\"-type swingers with nothing in between. None of them is particularly likable and NO ONE ends up particularly happy at the end of this, so this is not really a lot of fun to watch. It does have a great score from Ennio Morricone and Bruno Nicoli (that at times really overwhelms this low-watt movie). Then there's the visuals. . .", "Agostina Belli was one of the most beautiful Italian actresses of all time. She was kind of like Ornella Muti in that she was SO beautiful, it ended up being a kind of handicap to her acting. But unlike Muti she was not a really strong actress and ended up mostly in very memorable supporting roles (like \"Profuma di Donna\"). Ewa Aulin was another international beauty whose entire career was really overshadowed by her first, most internationally famous role \"Candy\". This movie is her best ACTING performance by far though in that she plays completely against her usual type (the sexy, dim-witted naif) and is instead an unhappy, jaded swinger. (Her role here kind of reminded me of the one Tuesday Weld, another 60's sex kitten, did in \"Looking for Mr.Goodbar\"). Femi Benussi, on the other hand, doesn't go against type AT ALL. But she is always good as the voluptuous sexpot, and the scene where she wears the Belli character's bridal veil (and nothing else) while she fools around with the husband is very memorable. Alfredo de Sisti (\"Private Lessons\", \"Fiorina la Vaca\") is always a serviceable director and he does a serviceable job here. This movie is definitely pretty dated, but it's not bad"]},

The killings in the film are glamorized as 'Pulp Fiction'-type sadism and the sectarian element is embarrassingly brushed aside. The film contains little element of 'gritty realism' (the locations look nothing like Belfast -it was shot in England), the performances and the script are dreadful, and the film never seems to know where it is going, or even why this tale is worth telling! In terms of politics,it is much to close to the bone but even without the Irish element it is a terrible film which thinks far to highly of itself. Exactly what are we supposed to feel for the lead character (he is given no redeeming qualities) and what are we supposed to take away from this film? Stuart Townsend's performance is one of the most insulting I've seen.

This film, along with Piero Pierotti's \"Golia e il Cavaliere Mascherato\" was one of the takeoffs banking on the success of Umberto Lenzi's \"Zorro contro Maciste.\"  This  little sub-genre, which grafts the swashbuckling film onto the traditional peplum, had an enormous success, and sparked new life into a dying genre.     This film bears all the hallmarks of Fortunato Misiano's productions, and bears the usual style and good story-telling of director Luigi Capuano.  Capuano directed the best adventure films, and this one is no exception.  It also shows faint signs of the cultural transition then happening between the continents.  Nerio Bernardi plays the staunch traditionist, who berates Alan Steel for his humble origins, but later concedes that \"nobility is revealed by actions, not by birth.\"  Piero Lulli plays the conniving courtier, who colludes with Andrea Aureli (the Black Pirate) to get Bernardi killed so he can get his hands on the lovely daughter (played by Rosalba Neri).  A wonderful film that bears up well after many years, this has its ample scenes of swordplay, suspense, and genuine humor."]},

Some of his films struggle in terms of credible character development, but here he certainly delivers in that area. It is a melodramatic movie, but it's never depressing. I would almost call it a bittersweet feel-good film. Also, I think Rappaport succeeded in giving us a very aesthetic, sometimes wondrous, and strangely philosophical take on human emotions. While the great heart of this film lies in its characterization, it's catapulted into greatness because of Rappaport's quiet touch. In nearly every one of his films the director is obsessed with the awkward silences that make up nearly every relationship. He's much more revealing with the silences here, fleshing out character development supported by fine acting.", "There isn't much of a plot for sure, but Rappaport more than compensates for this fact by creating three distinct characters that manage to be real without resorting to cheap sentiment. I'm happy that he gets the careful balance between static ugliness and a subtext of natural warmth just right. He was never much of a guy to dip in the mainstream and his best film might be this one, a miniature masterpiece that is underrated when compared to other Indie films.", "The film, essentially a love triangle, is also thankfully kept brief, becoming genuinely meaningful and moving as a result. One of the finest Indie films paired with really good dialogue and performances. I highly recommend it to the fans of Wim van der Linden, Angela Schanelec, Guy Gilles, James Fotopoulos, Jon Jost, Eric Rohmer, Jean-Charles Fitoussi, Tomás Gutiérrez Alea, Yvonne Rainer, Aki Kaurismäki and Jim Jarmusch."]},

Well, the entire thing was done in a very stagy manner--and confined everything to a very small space. Having the woman walking about in a store versus standing almost stationary on a small set would have improved things a lot. Also, this case is a great example where more is actually less. So many pieces of art are presented so quickly, that there is no artistry or flair--they just bombard the audience.

Although she doesn't actually love him she performs her duties in an admirable manner and because of that she is given a reasonable amount of money by his family when he passes away. So when her father also dies not long afterward she uses a portion of that money to relocate back to the small village she left several years earlier. However, the villagers all look down upon her because of her previous situation and as a result she becomes quite bitter and lonely. This situation changes, however, when the most popular person in the village named \"Seisaku\" (Takahiro Tamura) falls madly in love with her-and she returns that affection many times over. Unfortunately, having experienced the depths of loneliness previously neither are prepared for what happens when he is called upon to serve in the army and she is left alone with villagers who still despise her. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an interesting film which was greatly enhanced by a remarkable plot, good camera work and the incredible beauty of Ayako Wakao. Admittedly, there were a couple of scenes where the acting was a bit over-the-top but all things considered I enjoyed this movie and I have rated it accordingly."]},

He starred in one more movie later the same year, then returned to stunt work and direction, working on productions like HOW THE WEST WAS WON. He retired in 1979 and died in 1981, aged 88."]},

There's some really pretty animation here and the orchestral score is a major tour de force, particularly the tracks \"Aquarius, Planet of Water\" and \"Symphony of Aquarius\".

As pretty as it is, the story is extremely weak and most certainly not enough to carry the film through it's 165 minute runtime - while the rest of the film is at least above mediocre, the terrible beginning and the new villains' rather dodgy plan overshadows the entire movie.", "The movie begins with a red galaxy, coming from another dimension, crashing into our own and destroying the Galman-Gamilas and Bolar empires almost completely. Nevermind the questionable cosmology of this event, but it is then completely ignored in favour of an entirely new plot and feels like a rather lame excuse to keep Desslok out of the picture. After this a far too convenient string of lucky coincidences takes place; after escaping the destruction with a random warp, Yamato winds up near a planet being ravaged by Aquarius, a planet made entirely of water, causing floods and what amounts to a near extinction event for it's population - and Yamato manages to save no one else apart from a small boy, at a considerable loss of several of Yamato's own crewmen, too. On the way back home, Yamato is attacked by a new enemy - who just *happen* to be inhabitants of the destroyed planet - for no apparent reason. Meanwhile, other survivors hatch a new plan; they will use a massive space shift device to warp Aquarius to earth to flood it, to eradicate humanity and colonize earth! Wait, what? Meanwhile, Susumu Kodai, who feels his erroneous judgement caused the deaths of so many crew members, resigns, while the earth defense force learns of the villains' plan...somehow; this is never explained either. Nor is how flooding another planet going to help them; if they're just going to wait for the floods to subside, why can't they just wait for it on their own home planet? Okay, so we're implied to that the aliens' entire culture is based on egotism and social Darwinism, but it serves as a rather lame excuse for the stupidity of their plan.", "So the EDF decides to launch Yamato anyway to hopefully stop this plan, with a new captain; Juzo Okita, who died in the first series, is brought back to life with some more dodgy retconning, reducing Kodai to being subordinate once again. And the reason for all this is...I've no idea.", "You've probably already noticed that I've used the words \"weak\" and \"dodgy\" a lot in this review; that is because those words describe the plot of this film remarkably well. As good as the second half of the movie may be, it is not going to fix the horribly flawed premise. \"Farewell\", despite it's lackluster ending, would have been a much better conclusion to the Yamato saga."]},

So basically I paid the rock bottom price of $2.50 for this movie, if you do the math.  I can't exactly say I was ripped off.  I have a thing for trashy horror movies, but this is the kind of trash that gives trash a bad name.  The budget couldn't be over $1,000 (though it appears as if they spent a total of $1.50).  I know it's a low-budget film, but that's no excuse for totally uninspired camerawork.  The film \"Blood Cult,\" though not very good, was made for an extremely low budget and still had fairly good camerawork and acting.  The acting in this movie is the definition of \"effortless,\" especially from that muscular guy with the Texas accent.  Everyone is pretty much reading their lines off the page.  You can take that figuratively or literally.  I wouldn't be surprised if the script was off-camera as they were performing.  I said before that I've never seen a bad English actor.  This movie has quite a few bad ones.  And though English movies aren't always good, they always seem to have at least a level of sophistication, which is why I don't see why any Englishman, or Englishwoman, would volunteer to do a home-video-style schlock flick like this.  Did Merchant Ivory put a hold on their casting calls?  Usually, I think people are too hard on directors and actors.  Even some of the worst movies in Hollywood have some level of professionalism in the directing, acting and cinematography departments.  Even when you watch a movie like \"Glitter\" you can't honestly say it looks like a third-grader shot those scenes (though a third-grader could've written the script).  I've seen home movies that are shot better than \"Witchcraft X,\" and that's no exaggeration whatsoever.  Even the gore is minimal since the filmmakers only had money to buy some fake blood on sale at Party City.  Not a single effort was put into making this movie--let's just sum it up like that.  You get the picture. There's a good deal of nudity, though that doesn't save it.  However, I must say that girl with the red-orange hair, who's either naked or wearing a cleavage-popping outfit throughout the film, is really hot!  ", "\nMy score:  1 (out of 10)"]},

Both Barry and Jerry are stunned but fascinated by Cary's sordid and evil story. When Barry tries to persuade Jerry to reveal his best sexual experience, Jerry refuses. After being goaded in the locker room, Jerry angrily responds that his best sexual experience was with Barry's wife. He then leaves, with Barry too stunned to respond. Cary, also caught off-guard, says: \"That beats my story.\"", "After returning home from the gym, Barry confronts Mary over dinner about her affair with Jerry just as Terri accidentally finds out about Jerry's indiscretion and eventually confronts him too while they are shopping at a local bookstore. Mary and Jerry are both unapologetic for their unfaithfulness and express dissatisfaction to both of their spouses. Terri accidentally reveals her own lesbian romance with Cheri, but does not display any guilt for her infidelity. ", "Jerry confronts Cheri at the art gallery over his wife's affair with her. Cheri also shows no remorse or regret for her relationship with Terri, or with interfering with Jerry and Terri's troubled marriage. Cheri tells Jerry that Terri can do much better than being with him.", "Both of the couples split up. Terri moves in with Cheri, although she finds her emotional neediness irritating. Jerry continues his philandering lifestyle with his female theater students. Barry becomes miserable because he is no longer able to give himself an erection during masturbation. Mary is revealed to have moved in with Cary, who treats her as coldly as the other women in his life even though she is pregnant with his child. The film closes on Mary and Cary in bed, as Mary realizes that she is even more unhappy in her new relationship with the catty, heartless, misanthropic and misogynistic Cary than she had been with her clueless husband Barry."]},

Unfortunately Native women were really raped by white men, and the biggest problem was that no one ever believed the women if they came forward to tell other whites about it. But they dared not tell any other whites about what happened because first of all, it was none of their business anyway and secondly, if they did say anything about it to let's say other WHITE women, the Native women would have only been more ridiculed and scolded by them so it obviously best if they just kept it to themselves and their families. If a whole white town heard about it like the way that Native girl did, she would have felt guilty about herself. However Native people in those days usually didn't give 2 hoots about what white people thought about them since they just wanted to be left alone and live their lives in peace. Everyone in the white town would have accused the Native girl that she got herself into that kind of mess rather than blaming the white man who raped her!! Of course the real blame lies with that trapper who did that to her. Racism towards Native people was just too profound back in the 1800's and if whites ever found out that a Native woman got raped by a white man, everyone would have taken his side rather than defending the girl. It's a really sad fact but unfortunately that's the way things were back then.", "But......... anyways........... I found this to be a really good historical drama and I strongly suggest that people try to get it on VHS or DVD if they've never seen it yet and of course if it happens to be available.
