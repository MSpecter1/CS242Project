One member of the panel was usually Nipsey Russell, who also served as the 'poet laureate' of this show. At the beginning of each edition, when Dawson introduced the members of the panel, Russell would offer one of his brief poems dealing with an issue of the day. Nipsey Russell was a deeply talented performer who never quite achieved the success he deserved, partly because he seemed to be a conventional 'gag' comedian but actually did material which required the audience to do some thinking.", "There would be two masqueraders per show, each of them a mid-rank celebrity by 1974 standards. Dawson would announce to us (but not the panel) the masquerader's identity, while the camera cut to an insert head shot of this person as he or she normally appeared. (If you wanted to play along with the panel, this was the point where you would look away from the screen and turn down the volume.)", "The masquerader would arrive onstage wearing an elaborate costume that was meant to be an oblique clue to his or her identity, with the celebrity's face concealed beneath elaborate latex prostheses. Some of the makeup jobs were very impressive. Just occasionally, the masquerader would be cross-dressed as someone of the opposite sex, but the person's real gender was always obvious.", "The masquerader would stand on a small mock-up set which, again, allegedly offered some clues to the masquerader's real identity. The members of the panel would ask Twenty-Questions type queries: 'Are you a movie actor?' and so forth. If the panel were too baffled, the masquerader would periodically offer a verbal or visual clue.", "One fairly easy example: a masquerader appeared in costume as Captain Andy, the captain of the \"Show Boat\" in Jerome Kern's musical, standing on a steamboat's deck. When the panel failed to pierce his disguise, he offered this clue: 'We've got a lot of STARS on our boat.' The masquerader turned out to be William Shatner, who had formerly played the captain of a (star)ship. Geddit?", "A less obvious example was the masquerader who showed up disguised as a giant blue rabbit, hopping up and down on a set representing a carrot patch. When nobody guessed his identity, he flexed his arms and uprooted a giant carrot. This rodent turned out to be Peter Lupus, the former champion bodybuilder. Apparently the rabbit disguise was meant to suggest his name 'Lupus'. (Surely 'Lepus' would be more accurate?)", "There was always a brief moment of grossness each time the masquerader was called upon to unmask, as this required them to dig their fingers into their own grotesque faces and peel off large quantities of latex.", "'Masquerade Party' was hardly the worst (nor the most insulting) idea for a game show, and it avoided the huge displays of greed and vulgarity which some of its brethren have spawned.

Supporting characters like the ancient, wise [yet retrospectively out-of-date], owl, Virgil and sworn bodyguard, Norman, give Max's naive quest against the Skullmaster both a chance and comedic action as each episode begins with a multitude of interesting ways for summoning Max to his current mission [i.e. Virigil slipping the message into nearby objects and such - unexpectedly interrupting his fun times.

Movie like PLATOON , FULL METAL JACKET and HAMBURGER HILL were making money at the cinema while book stores were full of publications dealing with accounts of the conflict and there was even a top five hit in the British pop charts by a singer called Stan Ridgeway who sang about his life being saved in 'Nam by a marine called Camouflage . What a lot of people ( at least in Britain ) had forgotten if they even knew was that Australia had also fought in the conflict and this mini series tells the story of one family's war", "Vietnam was shown on BBC1 in the summer of 1988 with not much fanfare , but what wasn't mentioned was that two episodes would be edited into one . This certainly a good idea on the part of the BBC down to the simple reason that the early episodes are very , very slow as they introduce us to the characters of the Goddard family . The father is a politician in the Aussie government while the son gets drafted into the army while the daughter becomes a teenage rebel , and somewhat embarrassing to say it now but I couldn't help thinking that despite being a fairly good actress the Goddard daughter was one of the plainest looking girls I'd ever seen in an Australian series . The name of this actress ? Nicole Kidman . I digress", "As I said the first two episodes ( Or first episode if you saw it in Britain ) crawls along at a snails pace and the series doesn't come into its own until the action switches to Vietnam . This show doesn't sugar coat the face of war : Vietnamese women are tortured and raped by the American army , young Goddard is seconded to an American special forces team and watches as prisoners are tossed out of a helicopter AFTER they've told the Americans what they've wanted to know , a villager is executed in public by the VC after refusing to hand over all the food supplies , but the most memorable and distressing scene features an Aussie conscript who stands on a mine . It's a special sort of mine that doesn't explode until after the victim takes his foot off it so the soldier has to stay there under the blazing jungle sun till he can take it no more , panics and dies .", "I notice some people who have voted at this page ( Most especially the regular voters ) haven't been too impressed by Vietnam . The structure is rather uneven with a very slow beginning and the final episode(s) does hit you over the head that the war split Australian society but I can't help thinking the rather lukewarm response by some voters here has more to do with the fact they were expecting large battle scenes as in PLATOON and APOCALYPSE NOW . This is a foolish attitude since the Australians fought the conflict in a different way way from the Americans . Australia being experienced in anti guerrilla campaigns in Malaya and Borneo recognised the fact that this wasn't a conventional war therefore fought the war by sending small patrols into the villiages and jungles and went out of their way not to antagonise the inhabitants , a stark contrast to how the Americans conducted the war ", "Thanks to the internet there's now a large database of information of the Australian experience during the Vietnam conflict . It makes interesting reading"]},

I find it fascinating that many of the respondents interpret this film as something more than simply the photographing of a number of autopsies. First, this demonstrates a desire to bestow meaning on anything, whether it is elicited or not. Secondly, it exhibits a desire to deify anything created by an acknowledged artist-in this case avant-garde filmmaker Stan Brakhage-regardless of its true material worth. Ultimately, I think this is the wrong way to approach this film, which is simply the filming of a series of autopsies, nothing more, nothing less. Brakhage has stated that the metaphorical hermeneutic code is endemic in the material. This is true, but the notion that a dead body being stripped of its components says anything significant about the nature of life and humanity is highly contentious. Brakhage invests no artistic design in his film; he simply photographs the morgue workers in operation. Yes, we see imagery that is at turns repulsive and often saddening, but would we imagine anything else. It might be argued that, given the film's title, Brakhage is trying to demystify death. However, films like these are de rigueur in medical classes and therefore this 'scene' is not hidden from the world. People actually deal with it everyday. Those who have no exposure to the dead or the human anatomy will most likely have no interest in the material. So, once again, what is this film's worth? It is not artistic (despite other users trying to consign their own aesthetic design on the film), it is not useful, and it fails as a demystification of death or the human body. Ultimately, 'The Act of Seeing With One's Own Eyes' is a failure as a film and offers only limited interest as a curio."]},

I think there were three, perhaps four, Felixes made at Van Beuren and they were all worthwhile watches, but \"Bold King Cole\" was the best of them. It appears that the owner of the Van Bueren company died in the late 1930s, and that put a stop to this production...and to the studio. Burt Gillett soon went with Disney as the coast was \"raided\" for animation talent to work on his animated feature films. Winston Sharples soon made inroads into scoring animated feature films with The Fleischers, first with \"Gulliver's Travels\" music contributions, then to the Popeye cartoons, and he remained at Famous Studios--post Fleischer--until the studio shut down. He possibly scored more animated cartoons than any other single composer--though after 1960, they used his canned music over and over as a cost saving measure. I highly recommend \"Bold King Cole\". It's the best ever Felix the Cat cartoon, and they sure as heck don't make 'em like this anymore !!"]},

Although having a terrible quality of sound and image, the photography in black & white is very beautiful, having beautiful actresses in the cast and showing beautiful landscapes. One situation is not clear for me: in accordance with the information on the cover of this DVD, its runtime would be 98 min. The DVD has 83:25 min. In accordance with the information of IMDb, it would be 85 min. And in accordance with the Brazilian video and DVD guide 'Guia de Video e DVD 2003', page 161, it would be 133 min.

I know the label is too often applied to films in exaggeration or flat out error. But trust me, Dead Lucky is the real article. It is peopled by the dotty bumblers and ineffectuals from the working class and petite bourgeoisie backgrounds that made Hitch's early British films such a delight. (--Say, before Jesse Royce Landice in a mink hat and stole, gibbering about The Hamptons, came to epitomize the Hitchcock stock-in-trade dotty character.) These in-good-faith types are wholly inadequate to the task of coming to terms with a truly evil person in their midst when he arrives in the person of an apparently mentally-deficient assassin named Finn.", "Along the way, our nominal hero does a fair amount of struggling with impulses he dares not fully own. In all of this, there is a delicious irony at work that Hitchcock would have loved. The assassin is perfectly centered, knowing who and what he is about, while the mature hero flails about like a teenager trying to discover what he wants out of life. The assassin \"notices things\", while the bourgeois boobs, including our hero, seem credibly oblivious to everything until it hits them over the head. Thus, the nominal villain of the piece is in ways more admirable than the poor victims he will set upon. And we eventually come to understand that the hero is as empty as we first take the villain to be.", "None of this is forced, and it moves at the easy pace of life as it is lived.

However, by the early 1930s, the series was dead. Why? Well, the biggest reason is that the films were very original and creative in the early versions--far ahead of their time. But the quality of the films didn't improve and the competition sure did. With the creation of Disney's first shorts using the Disney name, the quality clearly was better than Felix and instead of retooling the character dramatically to catch up to Mickey Mouse, the studio and its creator kept making the same sort of pictures. Here in \"Felix the Cat in False Vases\" they FINALLY did something creative--but it was much too little much too late. While Mickey was a talking mouse, here Felix and the rest of the characters have weird sound effects for voices and they were added post-production...and the results are pretty dreadful compared to the competition. Other than a few cute sight gags (such as having the dog dig to China so Felix could replace the broken vase), the character is pretty tame and less fun than his early 20s version. Sad to watch...mostly because it's not all that funny and Felix COULD be tremendously funny."]},

However to even compare the laughs in that film with the low number in this is, well, laughable.  The film tries to have some `hilarious' set pieces but none of them are more than amusing.  Even the support characters who wander in and out only ever manage a few good lines.  What makes this harder is the serious side to the film where Sarah has a child and an abusive husband and Ben gets nothing but advice not to marry.  This element is present all the way through and makes the film much more of a drama than a comedy, but, because it wants to be funny as well, the drama doesn't really work very well.", "Affleck is a non-character here and doesn't have the charisma to really involve the audience.  Bullock is normally good but this is outside of her normal character and she doesn't wear the difficult edges well.  The two have a reasonable chemistry that helps them through the rough patches but they don't fizz or spark together.  The support cast throws up a few interesting faces who give good performances including Ronny Cox, Zahn, Tierney and a few others.", "The film has been applauded for the realistic (low-key) ending which is certainly better on paper than the usual formulaic ending and on this I pretty much agree.  It doesn't spoil the film simply because the 30 minutes before this are so very serious and not funny.  On top of this the film also has some nice directorial touches in slow-mo rain and hail storms.  However the impact of the emotional climax in a swirling wind of flower petals is rather spoilt by the really poor back projection used to carry it off.", "Overall though this film is a bit of a letdown as it manages to only half work as a comedy and as a drama although it does have some nice touches that make it worth seeing as long as you know what to expect."]},

Though she fails somewhat in the attempt to make it completely non-voyeuristic (its very provocative), its a brilliant attempt at showing what sex FEELS like from a woman's POV rather than what it looks like from a man's POV. The film itself seems to have been treated with bleach, baked in an oven, soaked in urine, and painted, scratched and burnt. Techniques that I believe she learned from filmmaker Stan Brakhage. She has commented that she was \"permitted to be an image, but not an image maker,\" in response to the swell of negative feedback after the public finally saw the film. The film is dream- like and very rich in colour. Its not so obscured by experimental/handmade techniques that you can't see what's going on. There are bits that seem to be memories and the present sex act which is like none other I've seen. Anyway, its probably one of my favorite short films of all time."]},

This is clearly seen to even the casual observer in the laughable flaws in continuity  even someone half watching (as I was) could easily pick out 4 or 5 things that just don't run together.  These and other flaws run through everything and even some of the fight scenes are just rubbish.  This is not to say all as some of them are quite good even if they haven't been very clumsily sped up to make them look more exciting than they actually are.

Madsen should really know better than this  he may not be an A-list star but he is better than bottom shelf stuff like this  he isn't even the lead here!  His character is difficult cause he is a bad guy in a form and I never got into him.  Madsen just plays him half asleep and it's a waste of a good screen presence. Tagawa is a B-movie star but even this is below some of his stuff.  He over-acts like a good un and has a cartoon villain for a character  I suspect he took it cause he gets to frolic with lots of sexy girls in underwear!", "Lai herself is pretty handy with her hands but is not `pretty' anything else.  She looks old at the start but looks better later on.  However her deep voice and slow delivery of lines makes it feel like she's reading off an autocue somewhere.  She can fight and she does make the odd fight scene worth watching but no more than that.  Hatch is awful and the chemistry between him and Lai is absent for much of the film and pasted on like a whore's lipstick in the final scenes to the point that I never bought it. Dourif is wasted  what in God's name was he thinking when he signed onto this?", "Overall this film is silly but could have risen above it to be a trashy martial arts B-movie that was enjoyable despite everything.  However the range of faults and lack of effort put into it just make it unenjoyable from start to finish.  Cheap production values, rubbish dialogue, absurd plotting and a real lack of attention to detail just shows this film to be a cheap thing they knocked out in a few weeks at most.  Cheap and nasty and with no redeeming features the only thing that amazed me about it was how they got so many famous faces to appear in it!"]},

I am talking about the silent ones they made from 1919 to about 1929. The films were, more than anything else, fun--with a strange surrealistic style about them. Felix was a joker--and occasionally a bit of a jerk--and I liked it that way. Well, the series petered out in the talking picture era--mostly because the cartoons lost their zip. The surrealism was gone and the cartoons became dull. A few years after their initial demise, Van Beuren Studios attempted to revive the series. Now considering that they only made three Felix cartoons, you can pretty much guess what the public thought. As far as I am concerned, the public got it right. Although the Van Beuren cartoons looked a lot better (with color and really nice animation), they changed Felix--making him a nice-guy. The public didn't want a nice-guy--they wanted FELIX! And, even though there was a strong welfare component to this film, even Depression era folks didn't take to the films.", "So what is there to like about this film? Well, the animation is probably the best of the three Van Beuren films. Also, I liked how Felix caught up with the boat--that was something the old Felix would have done. But otherwise, it's just a pretty film with absolutely no humor about it at all...none.", "*It's interesting how movies often feature Captain Kidd. As a history teacher who taught about pirates, I think it's odd how he is often talked about when he was actually one of the most pathetic and unsuccessful pirates in history. He didn't even willingly become one! He served with the British Navy and was sent to capture pirates. However, his crew mutinied and forced him to piracy.

Harris (best known for \"After the Ball\") who wondered whether audiences could be inspired to sing along with an animated cartoon. Magic lantern shows offering sing-along's to illustrated slides had been a popular form of entertainment long before the invention of motion pictures, but Harris believed the form could be modernized. Max put his brother Dave Fleischer to work on the project, and Dave came up with the concept: a live-action ball would bounce along atop the lyrics and guide the audience through the verse at the appropriate tempo, and as the song progressed the lyrics would be illustrated with visual puns and sight gags. It was a great idea, wildly popular with audiences from the very start. In later years, incidentally, both Max and Dave Fleischer claimed credit for creating the series, but it appears that Harris was the guy who got the ball rolling, as it were.", "The earliest series entries were silent, and it was up to local pit bands, organists or pianists in each theater to accompany the cartoons. In 1924 the Flesichers struck a deal with engineer Lee De Forest to produce some shorts with prerecorded sound tracks. De Forest, an unsung pioneer of the cinema, had been experimenting with a sound-on-film system of his own devising, producing short works featuring musicians, politicians delivering speeches, and stage stars such as Eddie Cantor and DeWolf Hopper. Together, De Forest and the Fleischers created the first animated sound cartoons fully four years before Disney's Steamboat Willie.", "The Fleischer/De Forest 'Song Car-Tunes' were simple little films that followed the same pattern established in the silent shorts. Has Anybody Here Seen Kelly?, one of the survivors, begins with Koko the Clown emerging from his ink well, smoothing his hair in familiar \"conductor\" fashion, then raising an Asbestos curtain to start the show. He calls forth a chorus of dignified-looking singers, and the song begins. No attempt was made to synchronize the words to the singers' lips; instead, the filmmakers cut directly to the lyric sheet. As the lyrics roll across the screen a comical stick figure dances across the tops of the words and occasionally acts them out (i.e. waving goodbye on the line \"since he said goodbye,\" etc.) And because the subject of the song is an Irishman, the song concludes with a drawing of a typical vaudeville-style \"stage Irishman\" of the day filling the screen, complete with green necktie and fringe of red beard. I gather original prints of this subject were hand-colored, but the one I've seen is in black-and-white and the animation is rudimentary, while the sound quality is no worse than surviving phonograph records of the period.", "Animation buffs will find this significant, though the average viewer may not consider it anything special. It's a pleasant song in any case, and it's interesting to see -- and hear -- a sound cartoon that predates Mickey Mouse by a couple of years."]},

It has many country western-style songs that play throughout, and the singer acts as a narrator. It tells the story of Beau Jim Donner (Beau is pronounced \"Bo\", F.Y.I.) who after years of traveling the world returns to his rural home town in Indean Head County. The town is now under the thumb of wealthy tyrant Sam Grady, who holds morgages on everyone's lands and keeps people in debt to him. He uses intimidation and thuggish tactics to take over independent businesses. When Jim's uncle Rusty refused to sell out, Sam had him crippled and confined to a wheelchair. The law isn't much of a problem since Sam's had the town's own sheriff, Little Leon, personally appointed. After coming home and seeing what's happened, Jim becomes a deputy and then secretly works behind the scenes to sabotage Sam's plans, such as intercepting a truck that Sam's had hijacked, and then calling the State Police. The mysterious, unidentified Robin Hood has become a local folk hero, and the radio D.J. Freighttrain Fremont has high praise for him. Jim lives at home with Rusty and Jim's friend Fred T., and Jim often quotes words of wisdom he's heard from various people while traveling the world. After six months of covertly messing up Sam's plans, Jim catches Sam speeding. A high-speed chase begins, and soon Jim has Sam pulled over for refusing to pull over for the police. When Leon comes by later and sees his boss in a jail cell, he lets Sam out, and Sam is now ready to go after Jim. Jim, at the urging of Rusty, leaves town with his friend Fred T. tagging along, and Sam sends Leon and his deputy Hector Jones after them. Sam's main thug Monty also goes out on his own to try to get Jim. From this point on the film becomes a series of car chases and near misses as Jim manages to stay one step ahead of his pursuers. Eventually after a few narrow escapes Fred T. decides a life of danger isn't for him and he gets on a bus and goes back to town while Jim goes on alone.", "This film has a great deal of humor and exciting car chases. If you're a DUKES OF HAZZARD fan, you'll love this. If you haven't thrown out your VCR, I recommend visiting the earlowensby site and buying this film, unless there's a video store that specialized in hard-to-find films that's close to you that has it."]},

Being a bullied klutz myself from the moment I started elementary school, I related to Milo's experiences and thought the movie was a lot of fun. I liked the movie so much I wanted to see it again so bad, but it would be years before I would track down another copy, but I eventually found one and it's been in my collection ever since.", "The quality of the script, direction and performances are better than in most theatrical movies, and considering that this was a made-for-public television movie for kids from the early 80's, that's saying something! The film is loaded with interesting side characters like Milo's teacher Miss Sandwich and the three old ladies at the bus stop who are bothered by him. I especially liked the subplot about him trying to win his older brother's respect and affection, in spite of bad timing and bad judgment. This is a movie that goes above and beyond when it comes to establishing likable characters and interesting situations.", "In the intervening years, I also read the book it was based on and thought that it, though funnier than the movie in a broad sense, didn't have quite the emotional impact. The third \"lesson\" differs between the book and the movie, and I have to say, I think the movie handles it better. In the book, Milo is directed to just sit and do absolutely nothing for twenty-four hours...this is to set up the point that being perfect is stupid and that it means doing nothing to avoid doing anything wrong. In the film, instead, the lesson is for him to do something he's never done before, and never thought he could do, while the point of \"being perfect means doing nothing\" is delivered at the end in passing. Sometimes establishing such a message in a brief manner is better than to belabor the point with a whole chapter of a book. I thought it was a much better idea for Milo to develop self-esteem by proving himself wrong by doing something he never thought he could. And for a kid with a history (even in first grade) of self-esteem issues, this was a liberating experience for me to see happen onscreen.", "Joan Micklin Silver is quite a talented, relatively unknown director, but here she mastered character and the internal lives of children. She was to do this again nine years later in the wonderful Big Girls Don't Cry...They Get Even (AKA Stepkids). These are the only two films of hers I've seen (though I intend to see Chilly Scenes of Winter soon), but she is one of my favorite filmmakers of her generation because she has such an ear for convincing, emotional character development and a taste for fascinating characters. Even if the same script were used, this film-in the hands of a lesser director-would not be half as impactful without Silver's sense of timing and sympathetic direction.", "In other words, don't be put off by this little gem by the fact that not only was it made for TV, it was made for PBS! It comes alive in a way that few mainstream theatrical movies do, and deserves to be seen."]},

Buffy Davis, as said wife, also has real presence, tackling the acting as skillfully as the varied sex scenes. Unfortunately, Tiffany Storm, while certainly visually appealing, is completely checked out, which doesn't do much for her carnal moments (and even less for the clothed moments). The best moment for Storm is probably the threesome on her news desk, as it's relatively quick.", "There's also an odd choice made to have Davis almost immediately in a threesome, complete with DP, with Francois (sporting a mustache that makes him look like his evil twin) and Randy West (the men apparently assume she is Storm, even though they look very little alike) , yet then play out the story afterward as if she is still waiting to be sexually awakened. Instead we have this followed by a tryst with Storm and her playing the voyeur at the perfunctory dull orgy scene, which just makes me wonder if the people who made the movie see a DP as a casual greeting.", "After these mistimed moments of awakening occur, Davis reconciles with her husband, played, of course, by Ron Jeremy, who is thrilled to learn his wife is now down for anything. Davis and Jeremy have a good spark together that means his usual comic ad-libs don't seem out of place (I would list a few of his fairly funny asides but they probably ARE out of place for this review...).", "The film closes on Sasha Gabor, who popped up a few times as one of Storm's sex pals, getting a visit from one-shot Delicia as a gift from Storm. Delicia soon gets down to nothing but a collar and leash, and performs a few tricks for a delighted Gabor until they go into a more traditional scene. At first I was surprised he got the closing segment, until I saw his name listed as executive producer. At least he knew to finish the movie on a memorable note."]},

It's astonishingly stupid, and obviously an excuse to have topless girls pose for the camera. That said, it plays like a gutter-satire on the Playboy videos of the times and the Mondo-Sexploitation documentaries of the '60s. Like all of Dark's stuff, there's a bunch of off colour, politically incorrect jokes in this, but like a John Waters film, it's so over the top that it's hard to get too upset. The tone of this one will be exploited in future hardcore films. That said, considering how dull softcore comedies tend to be, this one could be a 5 out of 5 film for the genre. Shout out to numerous porn stars making an appearance under their real names so I can't tell you who they are, and as always, Jack Baker is a treasure."]},

Michaels refers to their being \"in purgatory\" and I actually thought he was being literal (a la ending of DEVIL IN MISS JONES), since the video plays out in a downbeat \"no exit\" mode.", "While they await a third soldier, Steve Hatcher, gets serviced by $5 a pop Oriental whore Melinda Masglow. Back in the waiting room this schizophrenic (dramatic acting/dialog scenes vs. standard porno sex scenes) video concentrates on the verbal outbursts between our two incompatible heroes. Michaels, in one of his best all-time screen performances, is Mr. Motormouth, haranguing and baiting Dough, who he nicknames Wonder Bread. Racial tension later surfaces when Dough calls him by a slur in a fit of anger. Their two-hander drama is directed like a little one-act play, the claustrophobic TV counterpart of which was seen weekly in the '50s on the classic \"Playhouse 90\" series.", "But of course lengthy sex scenes are what matter and they drag IN THE BUSH down into the gutter its name implies. Lorenzo (Sean Michaels) has a flashback of better days back in Brooklyn with girl friend Isis, styled here as quite lovely and oddly resembling Rita Moreno (!). Their humping scene is well-done though shot mainly in tight closeups", "As J.T. (John Thomas), Dough remembers a pal giving him a present of two women, and the troilism/lesbian sex scene featuring Tina Tyler and an actress I had previously seen opposite Michaels (TOOTSIE POLE) but forgotten: Krista. Sean recalls his last r&r in bed with a sexy Oriental girl Kitty Yung.", "Dough's mind wanders back to his departure for war, and a hot sex scene with Sarah Jane Hamilton, one of the finest English Rose imports that American fans like to see get down and dirty.", "The generally depressing video exercise has an open ending and I was impressed overall with its ambition. I can see why it has been forgotten 20 years later, with changing fan tastes in leading ladies plus the indigestible aspect of trying to merge high & low art into a single package."]},

Jane's outfit is called A.U.N.T.I.E., and there's a white guy supposedly sent by U.N.C.L.E.

Because of her revolutionary cartoons, your green sticky landscape is oh so much richer and your fuzzy red hair flecked future is all the fatter. Joy Street even opens with the image of glowing threads of smoke lighting up dark alleys, an image that should \"resinate\" with the Herbal-American viewer. In fact, I believe this nine-leaf masterwork of the nineties holds a key position in the cultural history of the Herbal-American community. This film, which some of you smoked out to back in the day on the classic VHS collection Cartoon Noir, is a splendid visualization of why we smoke so much of this fine green eye medication in the first place: to enhance the inspirational aspects of life in order to battle with modern despair. Pitt gets despair right on: the closed in feeling of alienation, inner pain and hopelessness that can swallow up one's reality, especially when enhanced with alcohol and tobacco, is vividly recreated here, quite a feat for animation. In fact, some dopers out there will get flat-out bummed by the depression expression of the suicidal main character and wonder why I gave this the coveted nine-leaf rating. All I can say is hang in there, as many high-leaf viewing experiences have dark valleys that need to be traveled through, like the evil forest scene in Disney's Snow White (seven leaves) or the part where the son gets thrown in the incinerator by his dad in Pot, Parents and the Police (eight leaves). So hold tight and draw deep, cause the cartoon mouse ashtray soon comes to life, turning the black turtleneck of misery inside out. Here Suzan Pitt does her riff on the classic genre of still objects coming to life at night and partying, and what a riff it is. How many times have you been way past blue, took a big, fat toke, then suddenly noticed a small detail of your existence that makes everything seem suddenly worthwhile? That's what you get here. Pitt even includes a rain forest of inspiration for the viewer to play with, crafted from her travels in Central America, and it's a blast. Don't linger over the ape smelling the flower, though, as those of you who have experienced Pitt's other classic pieces of animation will no doubt read sexual connotations in the image. Now that will bend your head. Nine Leaves: Atomic. A perfect drug movie. Like going to another planet on your couch."]},

We see the actors shooting their individual scenes (including both sex and narrative content) and they are doubly fictional -playing fictional actors with different stage names and also the fictional characters the actors are portraying. Then in the BTS they are themselves, to the extent that actor Nick East is repeatedly colloquially called \"Scott\" by Lee, likely his real name, beyond the \"Nick East\" stage name.", "So watching \"Close-up\" was quite interesting from a structural point-of-view, but it fails in terms of featuring stimulating content, as to its sex scenes or the fictional story. Sex is mainly mechanical, seeming to document the hard day's work of sex workers (especially since the viewer in metacinema terms is focused on the artifical nature of the filmmaking process rather than suspending disbelief and becoming involved in a story).", "The movie within a movie that Lee is shooting is a potboiler, having to do with Jon Dough as a big-shot worried about his company's security arrangements, particularly to protect a very valuable diamond in its care. Kelly plays an undercover security agent hired by Dough to pretend to be his sister, and using that ruse to test whether security measures can easily be subverted. The plot of the surrounding movie deals with these two actors, called Randy and Jennifer rather than Jon and Kelly, dealing with a problematic personal relationship, in which Randy is domineering and highly unsympathetic to poor Jennifer. I found Jon's acting to be poor in both his fictional roles, whether he's Randy the actor or the businessman Randy is hired to play.", "At the same time, we watch Bud represent his problems and strategies as a film director (porno division) dealing with his actors. He seems duplicitous at times, in how he handles different players in a scene in order to achieve the overall desired result, and then we also see in the BTS his philosophy of filmmaking and how he specifically directs and advises the actors like Kelly and Buck Adams in a supporting role.", "To use the analogy of how porngraphy is rated legal by virtue of \"socially redeeming value\", \"Kelly Close-up\" holds interest, but unfortunately is not compelling entertainment."]},

This means we will watch a totally partial point of view, in every line favourable to the regime in question. In this case we watch all kinds of complements to the urban politics of Lisbon, 60 years ago. Basically this plan is the work of a remarkable man, Duarte Pacheco, who was not visionary, because he didn't predict anything that wasn't being done in other places, but he had the merit of updating Lisbon's urban politics - which in those is the same to say that he actually created one. That plan is remarkable, though dated today, specially in the ideas of dwelling in urban contexts, in terms of typology (single and twin family houses in highly urban contexts is dreadful politics today) and social agglomeration (low cost housing, grouping all the disfavoured, also dated politics today). Of course the success and efficiency of the plan depended on Pacheco (who died 5 years before this documentary) having full power to build and destroy, without negotiating with the populations involved. More interesting than anything is the idea of the \"urban lung\", materialized in the big Monsanto. Some dwelling projects are quite interesting, namely Alvalade. And of course, the rings that surround the city, is something contemporary and planned with a visionary scale (yes, here it was visionary), even though i think (not sure) not all the plan was completed.", "The documentary has one great quality. It actually explains the plan, the idea, on location, on plant, on models. It does not depend of useless conceptual demonstrations, because people in those days didn't depend on being shown iconic images as we do today. But many of the things we see there and especially most of the things we hear are perfectly laughable, and were already laughable in those days for anyone with a brain. The idea of making \"monumental\" so no one can be \"ashamed\" of the capital is ridiculous, as it is ridiculous the pride they take in grouping poor people like cattle by the more uninteresting parts of the city, while \"beautiful houses\" exist by the water side. Well, maybe we should treasure these commentaries, they are naive and for that less hypocrite than what we hear these days.", "A much more sad thing is to think that the documentary is totally centered in an underdeveloped capital of a than terribly underdeveloped country and that the works we see being made to modernize the place were insufficient to make the city have the conditions of other European cities, and worst than that, were the only ones made in that scale in the whole country. So, we have that ugly fascist principle of making one single enterprise stand for the whole country, who slowly died in those days.", "But the really sad thing is this: these guys, 60 years ago, had the same speech as the nerds we have today ruling the country. They had the speech of \"this was all wrong and now we're cleaning the country\". Basically, deviating the responsibility for their inability and the little ambition they place in the errors \"someone\" made in the past. So if they updated what was behind them, and for the last 35 years we've been updating what those guys left us, who will update the things we are Not making now? See the sad thing about this? When will we start doing something good, instead of just \"making up\" for what others have done? What a vicious circle.", "My opinion: 4/5", "http://www.7olhares.wordpress.com"]},

In Austria and abroad, post-war conservatism was faltering. In the United States, Kenneth Anger's \"Scorpio Rising\" and Jack Smith's \"Flaming Creatures\" challenged the code, outraging audiences and censors alike. Although they were sparely screened, they awakened a craving that audience were hitherto unaware of, a craving best articulated by Gregory Markopoulos, who said of \"Flaming Creatures\" that \"early audiences were astounded when their secret Hollywood fantasies burst upon the screen\". That Kurt Kren made \"6/64: Mama und Papa (Materialaktion Otto Mühl)\" at the same time as these films is an example of the Zeitgeist theory at work. At the same time, another director working in another country, Duan Makavejev in former Yugoslavia, had evolved from shorts to feature length films with \"Man Is Not a Bird\". Although the film was a breakthrough for Makavejev, he would not achieve the same level of sexual frankness, of erotic deconstructionism, or dadaism (or both), that Kren achieved in \"Mama und Papa\" until the 1970s. In the early 1970s Makavejev made his masterpieces, \"WR: Mysteries of the Organism\" and \"Sweet Movie\". In Kurt Kren, one can see a fleeting glimpse of what is fully realized in these films. A prominent parallel can be drawn between \"Mama und Papa\" and \"Sweet Movie\". In both films, the naked body of a woman (or women) is flaunted, and then covered with food. Both evoking a similar feeling of nausea (achieved with what may be termed the gradual destruction of the erotic). In their crusade for sexual expression, both directors seem to be proposing nothing less than a paradigm shift. Their destruction of the erotic is not an attack on eroticism or sexuality, but an attack on antiquated ideas of what is and isn't erotic, the comedy of manners that is our sexual etiquette. I write \"our\" sexual etiquette because not much has changed. There is still a lot of room for progress in the field of human sexuality. Making \"Mama und Papa\" as powerful and as relevant now as it was in the 1960s"]},

The message thankfully isn't preachy, and since Helit Katmor, the leading actress, is beyond beautiful, the movie is a really easy watch. She later became known for her translations of Proust into Hebrew while Jacques Katmor sadly became a tragic figure over time, sinking into alcohol and drug addiction.", "The grainy B&W visuals are typical for the '60s counter-culture aesthetic but still very lovely - melancholic and playful at the same time.

As a result, despite the entertainment value, it's obvious that the Fleischers crew were more focused on embracing the novelty of sound and musical timing back then as opposed to telling a cohesive story. It's not very often when gags work as substance in any form of media, and this one is not an exception at all.", "However, for Fleischer and retro animation enthusiasts, this short is still worth at least one viewing for historical pleasure. Considering how much the Fleischers loved to push the envelope through content in addition to animation technologies, there's quite a lot of innuendoes and double entendres afloat in the short alright. In addition to some rather risque character designs here and there, the humor relies a lot on witty shenanigans, so you do get some occasional grunts from Noah himself from time to time. Also, once the ending of the cartoon arrives, it ends in possibly the funniest way it ever could, so in this case, humor did save the day after all. Also, given the success of this cartoon at the time, there were many more Talkartoons yet to come, and the series would introduce characters like Betty Boop & Bimbo, so in many ways, cartoon buffs do owe at least some gratitude to this cartoon, as flawed as it may be. It also helps that you could see it as somewhat of a precursor to the studio's popular sailor character who would do wonders later on.", "Is it more of a product of its time given the limitations? Sure, but it's still fascinating regardless. Despite its lack of a consistent storyline and having more of an emphasis on the gags and musical timing, Noah's Lark stands as a precursor to the wild and crazy shorts that the Fleischer studio would produce within the following years. Even if we're just getting started on something like a film with sound, we all do our best with what we know, and the crew would only improve from here on out. So if you've yet to check this out, by all means give 'er a go. The Fleischers would make better stuff later on, but it sure is a good starting point."]},

Obviously, this movie was made with the intention of aping James Bond. However, if you are expecting this movie to be as hard hitting and action packed as a James Bond movie from the 1960s, you will probably be disappointed. There is more of a laid back attitude throughout instead of a feeling of tension or excitement. And there is very little action (though the few hand-to-hand combat sequences do pack some serious juice.) However, the movie is interesting that is portrays spying in a more realistic manner. There is always a feeling that whatever happens in this movie could very well have happened in real life. And while the movie does get slow at times, I personally was never bored, since the French perspective does add some charm and freshness. If you are looking for action, you better look elsewhere.

What is the \"even\" doing there? The late 1920s and the 1930s were something of a golden age of animation, witnessing inter alia, three superb full-length animated features Lotte Reiniger's Die Abenteuer des Prinzen Achmed (1926), Ladilas Starevitch's Le Roman de Renart (1930/1937) and Walt Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937), each in quite different genres of animation and each, in my own view at least, unsurpassed of its kind to this day.", "This is however precisely the juncture when the field of animation will begin to narrow. In the US, thanks to the factory-style procedures initiated by the like of Earl Hurd and John Randolph Bray, drawn animation was already becoming a form of mass-production, something with which other forms of animation (Reiniger's silhouette animation or Starevitch's figure or puppet-animation), which often involved years of painstaking work, could not possibly compete. (For further discussion of this see my review of Berthold Bartosch's superb 1932 animated short L'Idée). What is more, the US industry, by installing the \"cartoon\" as part of their typical film programme, were in the process of establishing a monopoly not only of production but also of distribution.", "As a result, it is true, the general run of US cartoons at this period, despite the nostalgic appeal they may have for USians, are of very poor quality. Max Fleischer is something of an exception. His \"Out of the Inkwell\" series, which have a very particular manner of combining drawn animation and live-action, have a real quality to them and would themselves influence Disney for a while in his \"Alice cartoons\". As time went on, however, even these were though to requite too much expense of time and energy and Fleischer, increasingly a producer rather than an artist, moved with a certain sad inevitability towards a style much closer to that of Disney or rather to the more down-market style of US animation because the more up-market style used for the Disney features was quite simply beyond the means of the smaller studios. Despite Betty Boop and Popeye, which kept him in business for a further decade, Fleischer cartoons never recovered the real distinctive quality thy had had in the days of Koko the Clown and Paramount, who had assumed control, would dispense with his services altogether before the end of the forties.", "These \"screen songs\", music videos of a kind, produced to capitalise on the advent of \"sound\", largely remembered today for the invention of the \"bouncing ball\" karaoke system, are perfectly watchable but nothing very special. This is in fact one of the better ones.", "The work of Len Lye, a New Zealander living in England, is a totally different thing altogether. Lye was basically a proponent of abstract film (one of the rare proponents outside Germany) and his first film, Tusalava (1929) had been a rather fascinating abstract design based on Australian aboriginal art and legend concerning the Witchetty Grub, the high-protein caterpillar that is a staple part of the traditional aboriginal diet. The \"primitive\" element in this four-minute film is entirely intentional and the monkey is not intended to look cute (and does indeed have a rather sinister, even threatening aspect). Like the Fleischer film, it is a music video (the monkey dancing the rumba to a Cuban hit-song of 1931)and was intended by Lye to be an idea for a whole series of such films. The attempt to fuse the avant-garde with the popular was perhaps an error in taste and was certainly an error in judgement. As the other reviewer's remarks make clear, no US audience (accustomed only to the \"lifelike\" and the \"cute\" in their cartoons) could possibly have had any understanding of the effects he was trying to achieve. Lye did however go on to make many more interesting short films."]},

", "I have often said that Surrealism works better when treated as entertainment: Luis Bunuel was its undisputed master in cinema (which is why he is my absolute favorite auteur) but, apart from the occasional attempt to shock an audience (notably his first two films), he learned to transmit his subversive messages (while always denying he had any!) in a subtle, indeed sophisticated, manner in order to reach a wider audience! Not so other noted directors whose work, however, leaves me cold to a considerable extent, namely Federico Fellini, Marco Ferreri, David Lynch, Alejandro Jodorowsky and Fernando Arrabal.", "Tellingly, the latter turns up here as an actor – but he is actually the best thing about the film, as an intellectual seller of traps (hence the title), and it is amusing to watch him demonstrate the practicality of a variety of traps from his ever more unwieldy stock to a prospective buyer! The latter subsequently invites a couple of women to his house (\"Nouvelle Vague\" stalwarts Bernadette Lafont, a Claude Chabrol regular, and Bulle Ogier, who actually co-starred in Bunuel's greatest film i.e. THE DISCREET CHARM OF THE BOURGEOISIE {1972}) – who, for no very good reason (since nothing comes of it thereafter) are made out to be nuns in the throes of devil worship! When they arrive, even though properly invited, they do not enter through the main door but opt to go in as burglars! Once inside, they try to cut through the safe with a blowtorch while giving vent to their anarchy by smashing everything that comes in their way. They cause a veritable mess – Lafont stomach-churningly plays around with assorted eggs, whereas the more child-like Ogier grimaces and moans incessantly! They paint their faces, disrobe down to their underwear, engage in a S&M routine, but only ever get to meet their host at the very end (even if he had actually been spying on the girls throughout their rampage!)...when the whole place blows up! ", "The point of it all is obscure and, frankly not worth unraveling; if anything, the film may owe a bit to Vera Chytilova's DAISIES (1966; which I own but have yet to watch), while looking forward to Jacques Rivette's 3-hour plus CELINE AND JULIE GO BOATING (1974; which I am familiar with and reasonably enjoyed). For the record, TRAP (an oft-used title, by the way, numbering among these a few interesting and versatile works) is the only film I have watched from this director and am only vaguely familiar with a trio of others from his not-so-vast filmography (comprising 6 shorts, 5 documentaries and 13 features made in the space of 55 years!). I generally admire the two actresses on hand, but this film certainly gives experimental cinema (with respect to both form and expression) a bad name – in retrospect, it is worth noting that, while the film was made in 1968, it was only first shown after having sat on the shelf for some 2 years..."]},

The second adaptation of the eponymous novel of the same name by the outstanding and famous Russian and Soviet writer Mikhail Alexandrovich Sholokhov. Why didn't you watch the first 1939 adaptation? It's simple - the fact is that it is based only on the first part of the book, and the second covers the main events of the entire novel. I have the book itself, it was already published in 1987, and I intend to read it as soon as I finish with How the Steel Was Tempered. Thanks to the rebel Jack for his interest in this work and this film adaptation. And here is my brief opinion - The history of the country in a difficult time. I was completely delighted with this picture, or rather the TV movie, divided into three episodes, because this is not just a film adaptation, but practically the story of the life of my grandparents in those years (if we remove the Cossack flavor). There is a small note, but I will mention this near the end. Let me now focus your attention on the expressive merits of this historical drama.\nSo, here they are:\n1. The topic touched upon - the picture tells us about Collectivization - the creation in the Soviet Union in the late twenties - early thirties of the twentieth century, a system of collective farms - collective farms in short, in order to bring order to the agriculture of a huge country. I am sure many of you have heard tales about \"innocent kulaks\", bloody communists, ruthless commissars (committees of the poor) who \"destroyed\" the Russian peasant and turned him into a slave. Classic liberal propaganda and tales that people have firmly believed in for more than one decade. I want to say to such people that without collectivization there would be no industrialization, and without it there would be no victory in the Great Patriotic War, and a post-war record-breaking restoration of the national economy. Collectivization was necessary, and it was not without human tragedies, this is true. There was injustice, but there was a lot. Life itself is never easy. Usually they are used to portraying this topic exclusively in a bad way and making the \"communists\" and \"nostalgic for the USSR\" repent for it. And here you are! Liberals, democrats and tolerance of all stripes!\n2. Scenario - a twenty-five thousandth man arrives at a Cossack farm from Leningrad (ask yourself who it is) Semyon Davydov - a communist sent to help the local party cell to create a collective farm. Cossacks are a people that needs a special approach. And Semyon is still in the past - a Baltic sailor. I will not talk here about the feelings that people from these groups have for each other. You know all this perfectly well without me. Here our hero will have to get acquainted with the local situation, so to speak, to conduct agitation so to speak, to establish contact with the locals so to speak, and to expose the White Guard conspiracy so to speak. There are more than enough events in the picture. The creators were obviously careful about the original source, for which I thank them. The local flavor cannot be confused with anything - Don is like Don, Cossacks are Cossacks. If you love pictures on historical subjects and on this era, and do not want to look at modern chernukha on this topic - then you definitely come here!\n3. Characters - communists, White Guards, kulaks, Cossacks - in short, everything is shown by people with their own merits and demerits, who rejoice at victories and sad at defeats. Among them there are idealists and materialists. The outlined transition from the old world to the new, which is being built by the communists and collective farmers, is clearly visible. You empathize with all of them, because everyone is right in something. Even the romantic line made me happy. I liked how the characters communicate with each other - in a simple way. As it was in reality (thanks to my grandmother's stories about village life). All the characters are captivating with their sincerity, and the actors did their best.\n4. Final - it was unexpected for me, partly even shocking. To see this was akin to Gagarin's flight into space. I was counting on a completely different ending, but it turned out the way it happened.\n5. Atmosphere - music, acting, costumes and scenery make it clear from the first seconds that we have an epic canvas and the fate of the people of a huge country in a difficult time. Only recently has the world changed forever, and now the whole world is looking closely at the world's first socialist state and its beginnings. But the work is not easy - to turn the agrarian country into a powerful industrial superpower, capable of repelling any attack of the enemy, both external and internal. The old world is broken, and new generations will have to build a new one - the best one, where all people will be happy. They worked, did not spare themselves, for the sake of us and our descendants, and we are the future - we flushed it down the toilet and sold it for gadgets. Worthy. Say hello to those who rode in August 1991 in Moscow.\nA little about the main characters:\n1. Semyon Davydov performed by Pyotr Chernov - a Leningrad worker who arrived in a Cossack farm to carry out the order of the party. A courageous, decisive, reasonable person who instantly finds his bearings in a difficult environment. He won't go into his pocket for a word. Meanness and deceit are absent. Captures the viewer's attention almost instantly. Peter played this role perfectly.\n2. Makar Nagulnov performed by Yevgeny Matveev - secretary of the party cell of the farm. In the past, he was a renowned commander of the Red Army who had awards. A brave and no less charismatic hero than Davydov. Will definitely become your favorite as soon as you start watching this picture. That's for sure! Evgeny Matveev played the role of a local communist superbly. Bravo!\n3. Shukar performed by Vladimir Dorofeev is a local grandfather who looms somewhere nearby, and periodically distracts attention with his everyday stories. He was a watchman who had seen a lot. An interesting point by the way, Vladimir Dorofeev played the same role in the first film adaptation of 1939.\nThe first episode turned out to be dynamic and memorable. The second and third cannot boast of this, unfortunately. Monotony at a certain moment can ruin interest. What happened to the White Guards? Unfortunately, no one will answer this question. These comments are insignificant, and do not greatly affect the final grade.\nAgain, I liked the picture, because it shows the history of our common country, citizens of the former USSR, which our ancestors built for us not so that we would miss it and sell it, which ultimately happened. The picture honestly and sincerely shows their difficult life and collectivization. And it's good that modern directors didn't reshoot this picture.\nAnd one more thing - the picture clearly needs restoration and re-release in the blu-ray format, so that the new generation of viewers can get acquainted with this picture and see the life and exploits of our grandfathers and grandmothers, great-grandfathers and great-grandmothers.\nAs a result, we have an excellent historical drama, based on the epochal novel by Mikhail Sholokhov, with an excellent script, excellent atmosphere, excellent theme, great atmosphere, and amazing acting work.\nMy rating is 9 out of 10 and my recommendation for viewing!"]},

It's notable because it introduced the character that was most identified with United Productions of America than any other: Mr. Magoo. In this initial entry, he and his nephew Waldo are going to a ski lodge where the near sighted uncle gets grouchy every time his fur suited nephew plays the banjo. The short's title comes when Waldo falls from a cliff and a bear sitting on a tree gets the banjo which he then plays. Guess who Magoo mistakes him for? Since this was his first appearance, the design of Magoo is a bit rougher than his later cuter form and Jim Backus' voice is also not so charismatic. Still, there are charms aplenty especially when that bear starts playing or when he tries to get guitar out of Magoo's hands while he's sleeping. And Quincy Magoo's nearsightedness doesn't get as annoying as in the later '70s series from DePatie-Freleng. So kudos to creators John Hubley, director, and Millard Kaufman, writer, in whose memory Ragtime Bear was dedicated to from Amid at Cartoon Brew a few days ago."]},

All are chosen for their various qualities of ignorance, arrogance, unattractiveness or just plain creepiness. The \"erotic\" baker is innocent of any crime against women, he merely makes bikini-torso cakes for male customers. Much is made of the fact that the cakes don't have heads. The revelation that men prefer a woman's breasts is less than shocking. A discussion among elderly VFW-types nearly makes a statement about middle-American values in regard to male-female roles, but the film-makers can't come up with anything more incisive to ask than \"would you let your son play with dolls?\" The advertising industry is put on trial for its use of attractive women in print ads, as if it was inherently evil to show women in their underwear in a women's underwear ad! An extremely narrow and unenlightened attempt to portray men as abusive brutes that fails miserably. Entertaining as an example of bad film-making."]},

He never knew his now deceased father but inherited a few old record albums, some photos and a perfectly preserved 1961 red and white Corvette convertible. He picks up Arthur Clark, a loud-mouthed hitchhiker (Dan Cortese) and their journey into escapism begins. On June 3, 1993, Cortese and Wilder served as emcees for \"Route 66 Day\" in Santa Monica, California, organized to kick off the series and also celebrate the 40th anniversary of the Corvette. They presented Mayor Judy Abdo with a bronze plaque on behalf of NBC and Columbia Pictures Television saluting the city for its participation in \"Route 66 Day\" and the city's historic position near the end of the famous highway. Harley Peyton, executive producer and writer of the new series, said the idea for the show simply came from his desire to do a road show. He said he knew that such a show would be a rip-off of the early 60s series, so he just concluded he might as well do a new Route 66. But I personally think he should have used an original title like \"The Highway\" or whatever. I think he was probably capitalizing on the name of the original series to give it a shot in the arm. Hey, at least he didn't use the original theme song. The music for the new show was by the very capable Warren Zevon. I was a big fan of the original Route 66, and to be completely fair, instead of scoffing at the idea of a sequel, I welcomed it. Most Generation-Xers had probably never seen or heard of the original series and it could have been a great modern day adventure of a couple of guys travelling the highways and byways, meeting new people and experiencing life. But with just four episodes, it just didn't get the chance to completely develop the characters or stories. Part of what made the original series such a hit was the scenery. All four episodes of the remake were filmed in beautiful California, but not enough scenery was shown."]},

For a document about the fragility and hidden natures of the human body; Sanctus is surprisingly delightful. Ms. Hammer finds many engaging ways to make, what is predominantly medical footage, playfully whimsical. When her accentuating color choices are pastel, things like intestinal ballooning procedures take on a practically party atmosphere. Her frequent tilting of images within the frame, overlapping Rorschach-style double exposures, and blending of images and patterns, all lend to a welcome lightness - which juxtaposes with the murkily blurred darker toned images, with bodily fluid reds and yellows, mysteriously shaped presences within the bodies, loaded triggering words ('diagnosis', 'cancer', etc) and the decay of chemically assaulted filmstocks. 'Sanctus' (taken from the title of the accompany sound composition), is a brief look behind the curtain of flesh to the discomforting and surreal world inside."]},

The film shows how experiences shape people to the better or worse, in this case it is Schoenberg through the change from innocence and poverty to arrogance and wealth. Although it's a very simple plot it hides many hidden symbolic elements which when revealed really makes you realise how superb this film is. The music in this movie along with the camera shots really are touching and do feel surreal, magical and pure. Back then it was hard to make a truly scary scene but this movie manages to capture some very eerie moments which even made me feel uneasy, in the kidnapping scene everything seemed a bit off, the kids were dreaming of a happy jolly santa but they were greeted with a dirty, deceitful and ambitious santa, thirsty for wealth and the illusion of happiness . The plague scene was miserable, it engulfs you in darkness and and people seem to lose their fire and become soulless striders exhausted by the plague chipping at society and hope day by day. Finally there's the dragon scene, it represents how civilisation will always want more, humans are greedy by nature; the judge scene conveys the social imbalances of humanity and injustice of law and corruption in pretty much all countries. For a film that's 40 years old it's just a blast to watch, although the creatures look a bit goofy they still strike fear and terror into you. What fascinates me is that sometimes people can make better quality movies with less resources, for example this film is much better than a lot of present day films. Overall a surreal film."]},

Even though many of the actors are familiar from numerous roles, they all make convincing characters.", "The main problem is that the municipal satire (occasionally descending into lowbrow farce) seems a completely different film from bank director Haapanen's personal tragedy. The former is lively and fascinating, the latter boring, uninteresting, one-note and laughable. There are many undeveloped themes (the right-wingers who influence things from prison, the gravestone swindlers) and unbelievable scenes, most notably the first crook who bothers to build an illegal radio system to insult the municipal leaders before escaping with everyone's money. Diversions like this clash with the general realism too badly.", "Critics were annoyed by director Niskanen's star performance - he had played too many tormented, well-meaning men who are crushed by their circumstances. The critical slurs hurt him so much that he didn't play the leading role in any of his later films. I think that his performance is very good, it is the script that he should have thought about more carefully."]},

But I was unaware of the nightmare it was to film it & release it; all I did know was that it was in & out of the theater faster than COOL AS ICE. I had no idea this movie even existed until I read James Robert Parish's book FIASCO, which has a chapter on the making of TOWN & COUNTRY...and which, rest assured, is more funny & believable than what shows up on the screen.", "After searching relatively high & low to find this movie (it was released on DVD, but logically, stores do not exactly keep a copy on hand), I watched it knowing about its history & that chances are, I would likely want to throw things at the screen. I am glad to say I made it through the first viewing alive, but will start by saying that no, this movie is not a winner in the slightest. Yet is it an all-around creative bomb? Not so fast.", "Starting to film without a complete script was the oldest mistake in the book & they made it. Yet while it may have been a patchwork effort without much rhyme or reason, some lines were funny & rather inspired (most of them coming from Garry Shandling, who almost walks away with the movie, such as it is). Maybe having mature, veteran actors mouth some of the more scatological dialogue (as if this was supposed to be a senior's version of American PIE) was not wise, but that is often funny to watch in itself. Diane Keaton's line near the end, \"Is there any women in this room you haven't slept with?\", could easily be what audiences have been wondering for years. ", "The only thing the script missed was continuity & structure, and all that showed on the screen, resulting in a film that looked & acted choppy, with many characters played by big names being reduced to glorified cameos, making you wonder if there is a lot left on the cutting room floor (but we cannot blame the editor for all that, seeing as how they did not have much to work with). ", "The producers should have been well aware that working with Warren Beatty, a famously noncommittal perfectionist, was not going to be clear sailing. Part of (if not all) the script problems can be laid at his door, since he kept insisting on changes to the dialogue, taking up time & (most obviously) money. And of course, Warren was in his early 60s when he made this movie, playing the same old Casanova he always did. Audiences, most especially the young people who make up a large part of who goes to the movies, are not going to buy that anymore, or are unwilling to try. The studio should have saw this in the beginning & realized the chances of a box office success were slim to none, and thus rein in the budget before it went haywire.", "After reading Parish's book & seeing just how things went bad with TOWN & COUNTRY, I rather think a movie about the making of a movie like TOWN & COUNTRY would have been better (and with all the same actors). What went on behind the scenes was funny & screwball in itself, and most of all, it was not even scripted at all. There was potential for a movie like TOWN & COUNTRY, but if a script had been agreed on before the cameras started rolling, then the financial fallout would not have been so large. As it remains now, it is one of the biggest box-office duds in Hollywood history, and the chances of it ever turning a profit are almost nonexistent (just think about inflation).", "Final thoughts: For what it was worth, the actors gave it their best shot with this movie, never once placing tongue firmly in cheek with their parts (though, by all accounts, that would have improved things). I am not sure if anyone of them knew they were making something special.", "A good portion of the script was actually funny, but whenever it tried to get serious & make some kind of statement about infidelity & morality, it went downhill from there. Even the much-bandied-about ending is so artificial & predictable, you can see it coming from a mile away. More of a cop-out & a feeling of \"Let's just finish this thing already!\" ", "Most of the people involved in making this movie have survived professionally, but only time will tell how Warren Beatty fares (that is, if he makes another movie again). Hopefully, the TOWN & COUNTRY incident awoke him to the fact he needs to finally revise (or abandon altogether) his stock character if he ever wants to work regularly & be taken seriously again."]},

Well, he loses a major fight, and his manager, Barney Taggart, takes him to a ranch for intense training. Clifford's already met the ranch owner's niece, Charlotte Pierce, and they seem to be very mutually attracted. Meanwhile, the relatively new ranch foreman, Ervin Reynard, is actually a robber who, in conjunction with a couple of others, has stolen a large cache of very valuable jewels from a train. The film is loaded with underlying comedy, though it's played somewhat straight. The other main character is Hooper Phillips in his only known film, playing Charcoal the valet, a black lackey whose character is every racial stereotype of the comic black man of the early days of film to near 1970s in the medium. He IS funny, but only at the expense of racial derogation at its worst. Too bad, because Hooper Phillips steals the show! He's an early Mantan Moreland, and equally talented. I've never heard of any of the actors in the film, but the film plays relatively well. Lasting only 52 minutes, for a forgotten 20s silent comic Western with some good antics this isn't bad. One last note: the star, Gordon Clifford, is best remembered today as a popular song writer, and he combined talents with such noted songsters as Nacio Herb Brown and Harry Barris and wrote \"I Surrender Dear\", \"Paradise\", \"Sahara Nights\", and several others that were quite respected in their day. Clifford only made eight feature films. He died in a traffic accident in Las Vegas in 1968 at the age of 66. Charlotte Pierce married musician and talent scout \"Solly\" Baiano in 1926, the year after this film, and she retired from films. One of their sons married singer Jaye P. Morgan.

One of them, a film director, claims that it has to be real because it has no real plot. The fact is, not only does the film have a very basic horror movie plot, it also has about half a dozen subplots, like mom's alcoholism (the woman carries a wine glass even while running from aliens) or sister's dating a black man. No matter, though. For what it is, it's actually very well done. It's quite frightening. I'm surprised it didn't lead to bigger things for the director.

I will admit though that the marine yelling at and insulting a group of girl scouts was about the only time I laughed at the film. Maybe if the film had more non-fart jokes, I'd be more into it. The only other credit I can give to this film is that I appreciated some of the craft put into making it resemble how game shows look. Though yeah, I found so much of the film to be a chore to get through. By the halfway point, I was basically zoned out of the film and wanted it to end. And given that it doesn't even last an hour, that's saying something. The buildup to the challenges were overlong, the backstories to the contestants and the commercials sank the pacing like a dead weight, and the challenges themselves, while they were the more watchable parts of the film, still weren't that engaging and didn't build much of any tension like some other game show challenges I've seen have.

It is a story of people and their thoughts and their words, and this is a silent movie .... and so takes a lot longer to do than a stage play. And so characters and subplots need to be cut, but Antoine is -- understandably -- loath to cut them. And so we have the subplot of the shepherd and his lost love raised .... and dropped. We have characters who don't serve any purpose, not even the exposition of the character from the original, since their screen time is cut so severely.", "This is always a problem in the translation of a work of art from one medium to another.

Here he falls down a bit. Like any fan, he doesn't want to give up any of it, but as a responsible movie maker he knows he must -- and he leaves in just enough to tell us that what we are seeing is not a complete work of art. He belittles own work by not doing a neat job of work, so how seriously can we take it? ", "Well, there are some lovely images. Enjoy it for that."]},

In a possible nod to 1976's Taxi Driver, one of the thugs sports a Mohican, and others have DAs.

Like most of the others, I do enjoy Miike's work, though not to the level of unconditional love that seems to be common here. In my limited experience, around nine Miike films so far, none have been a waste of time and several are fairly amazing. Notably Audition, though definitely not for the faint of heart.", "This film left me with mixed emotions. It truly has touching moments, but it also suffers from common issues with Miike films... disjointed structure, unmotivated action (particularly from the Yakuza character), a bit of excessive violence, a kitchen sink approach to ideas... every possibility explored, even when simple would have been more effective, and finally a liberal borrowing from other films. In fact I'm surprised this hasn't been mentioned in other reviews. Miike clearly took much of the premise and emotional content from the movie Local Hero. A corporate drone begrudgingly travels to a remote village and, to his amazement, is touched by the locals and the lifestyle. There's more to the similarities but I don't want to give away too much. Though I will note that he pays homage to his source material by throwing in a Scottish song as a major motif. I also didn't buy into the ending... it seemed to detract from the more realistic aspects of the film.", "All of this aside, the film is worth seeing. The scenery is amazing and fairly unique, the photography handsome (considering the budget), Masahiro Motoki as Wada is quite good (as he was in Okuribito/Departures), many of the secondary characters are wonderfully drawn (another Miike specialty), it's genuine and funny at times, and it takes you on an unusual journey, an actual adventure... rarely a dull moment."]},

If you don't know what this term means, either you're not French or not familiar with the aftermath of the Algerian war for independence.", "The derogatory expression refers to the community of French citizens born in Algeria and pushed into a massive exodus once the independence obtained. The vast majority were of Jewish persuasion, some even had their Ancestors living in the region for far longer than Muslims with Arab origins but nevertheless they were considered French citizens and paid the price of their attachment (or detachment depending on the perspective) though an offer from the independent militia that they couldn't refuse: the luggage or the coffin.", "I recall from many documentaries the emotional heartbreak induced by this blackmail, one of the emblematic figures of the community, singer Enrico Macias his 'uncle', actually his wife's father and mentor and member of the Algerian orchestra, killed at broad daylight and that murder triggered the community to leave France. That's for the context and a bit of knowledge is crucial to understand why Arcady who grew up in Algeria, felt the need to make a film, the first of its kind, to recall the tragedy of a collective uprooting less than two decades earlier.", "And so we follow the Narboni family, living in Tadjira, Algeria. The father, named Albert, is a larger-than-life grocery shop owner whom we meet in 1945, proudly announcing the birth of his son Paulo and immediately writing 'Narboni and son' in the sign, clearly the man sees no future outside Algeria. The mother is Marguerite (Marthe Villalonga), a noisy and nosy housewife who enjoys gossiping with the neighbors and commanding the Arab maid. And Paulo, played by Patrick Bruel, is the shy teen whose puberty coincided with the climax of the war.", "The first act of the film -more than half of an hour- recollects the memories of the Golden Age through a series of little vignettes that might strike as too anecdotal and lighthearted given the gravity of the subject. I think they all work to the degree that we accept the film doesn't want to inject pathos in the first story about the community. The problem is that the parents are so loquacious that the son is given a chance to shine on his own, dominated by two strong personalities and the 'eloquent' narration from the voice of Bruel doesn't hit the right chord. An adult movie or the kid talking with his own language would have worked better.", "It's a common device for nostalgic movies to use an adult narrator, think of \"A Christmas Story\" for instance. Adult voices provide the necessary perspective that give the flashback their touch of endearment. \"My Father's Glory\" and \"My Mother's Castle\" were true childhood films but the adult voice-over allowed us to examine the youth in the way it shaped the character's adulthood. Another film like \"Mayrig\" about the Armenian community featured the other extreme with a lot of lyrical poetry in Richard Berri's memory recollection. In \"The Kick of Sirocco\", it's still the voice of young Bruel and somewhat it doesn't match.", "I guess the approach of Arcady was to give a personal touch and only in the unfolding of events followed from the standpoint of the Narboni family, I read the original material was much darker and it was after reading the novel from Daniel De Jean-Hermont that Arcady felt he could tell the same story without too much pathos. The result is a film that kind of exaggerate the traits commonly associated with the Black Feet community but through the over-the-top performances of Hanin and Villalonga, we rather accept the film as a drama-comedy.", "Hanin, who left the world in 2015, had the mimics of another Province icon Raimu with the singing accent of Fernandel as if he was born in the casbah and his presence phagocytes every other character around. Villalonga in her performance established that she was born to play possessive Jewish mothers with every situation leading to hysteria. And between these two Paulo tries to live a normal adolescence, there's even the beginning of a little romance but cut off brutally by the mother's intrusion. That Paulo never figures out what went wrong and end up disappointed by the film's Parisian is one of the little things that left me dissatisfied.", "There's another subplot involving a French businessman who seems to grow a liking in Albert, he's played by Michel Auclair but that subplot of the real estate scam is handled like a last-minute addition to the plot that could only be solved with a half-baked twist involving a gun. I'm not sure the film even needed such a subplot. Maybe Arcady should have stuck to the 'vignette' approach à la Fellini's \"Amarcord\" and provide here and there a few moments of emotions.", "And there were such moments, the interaction with the Algerian baggage-handler in Marseilles train station was like the film's soul imploding in two minutes of greatness, Albert is asked why he left Algeria, then throws a tantrum against the Arab blaming him for their downfall and asking him to leave France, that it ended with Marguerite giving him a generous tip sealed a sort of tacit and symbolic reconciliation with the same resonance as Hanin being buried in his homeland: Algeria. Such moments were needed but Arcady trusted his actors more than his material and yet from these flaws emerged a little gem (little underlined).", "So what's left are some tenderly poignant moments, an odd detail involving a coffin being taken out from the very building they settled downed in, the whole atmosphere of the early 60s, and the idea of the canned couscous from cousin Jacob (Lucien Kavayah) which strikes as a clever metaphor for the whole Narboni journey..."]},

Of the 1932 batch, 'Wins Out' and 'Let's Eat' were mediocre and 'The Winged Horse' was on the forgettable side, but 'Grandma's Pet', 'Beau and Arrows' and 'Mechanical Man' were good, and 'Cat Nipped' and 'A Wet Knight' very good.", "Although not as good as 'Cat Nipped' and 'A Wet Knight', 'Day Nurse is a nice, pretty good cartoon and hardly one of the weaker 1932 cartoons, somewhere around high middle actually.", "One of the weaker assets is the story. Oswald cartoons are not really seen for their stories, nearly always being one of the least strong assets and in the weakest Oswald cartoons one asset that is noticeably weak. 'Day Nurse' takes a very familiar premise and doesn't do a whole lot special with it, too much of it feeling structurally thin and predictable.", "Slapstick, of the silent kind and reminds one fondly of silent films from 10-20 years earlier (so Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton), mostly works very well, though occasionally a little overcooked. That baby, even for a type of character meant to be that way, is an irritating brat, one feels really sorry for Oswald here.", "Conversely, like what was said with 'A Wet Knight', the best assets are the gags and the music. The gags are some of the funniest and imaginatively timed of the 1932 cartoons, so refreshing after seeing many previous early 30s Oswald cartoons where the humour has been hit and miss and not particularly funny. Nothing feels random or repetitive. The music is infectiously jazzy and dynamic as well as lushly orchestrated, synchronising very well with the music. The synchronisation is remarkably natural.", "Also good is the animation. It may occasionally lack refinement, but most of it is smooth and detailed with Oswald's movements, gestures and expressions still very much natural, like the generally freer, more elaborate and faster look of a good deal of Oswald cartoons at this time. Drawing has occasional crudeness but is mostly fine and transitions don't feel as choppy and incomplete as some of the worst Oswald cartoons. Sound is pretty good.", "Regarding Oswald, he is fun to watch and very easy to like and relate to, and throughout 'Day Nurse' has a lively pace.", "In summary, pretty good. 7/10 Bethany Cox"]},

It also has a good deal of nostalgic value. 'Fair Today' is good, colourful fun, though it is a cartoon that doesn't end as well as it started. It is not hysterical or a high spot in Lantz's career, but it is well crafted, amusing and nostalgic that should delight enough kids and adults alike (if perhaps more so the former). This viewer doesn't always see fairs lampooned (something that Lantz did a lot with varied but mostly good results), or at least not to this extent, and the lampooning was mostly done well if unevenly later on.", "Bad things: Not everything works. It is a little rushed and over-stuffed at times, especially in the over populated final quarter where the content also became not as inspired and instead pretty corny.

The music is lush and characterful throughout and a vast majority of the animation is excellent. Loved the extremely rich attention to detail in the backgrounds and all the character designs when the fair is in action are suitably varied and with a lot of effort and care put into them.", "While nothing is hilarious, most of 'Fair Today' is very amusing and the lampooning is mostly witty and sharp, it is not hard to recognise what is being lampooned too (already faring a lot better than most lampooning cartoon in this aspect).

Rudy interrupts some thugs threatening another drunk and sends them off but, for the laugh, the oldest boy locks another in an abandoned fridge. Unable to get the door open to let him out, Rudy and Alice try to get help and keep the trapped boy alive until someone can help him out.", "As a simple story about a boy trapped in a fridge this is an effect and urgent little film that gripped me until the end due to its pace, brutal energy and the life that was at stake. So as a sort of slum-set race against time it works well, however if this is all you think it is then you have totally missed the point. The film works best as an allegory for poverty and the boy in the fridge is not the only person trapped and needing help. At times it makes this point a little heavily but mostly it is clever and spot on. Rudy and Alice are trying to help the boy but everyone they turn to turns a blind eye and it is up to the poor to help themselves (when it would have been so easy to call for a fire engine). The sense of feeling behind this message is powerful and it left a real impression on me as a result.", "The film is unrelentingly bleak and it does not try to make anyone look good  even when Rudy is trying to save the boy, a squabble over drink takes precedence over the rescue. However those in the houses are also treated badly  they close their doors and ignore the problem in the same way as they ignore Rudy and Alice living on their street, scrounging money for drink and beaten and dirty. The film captures this really well in terms of content but also in terms of look as the cinematography is superb. Washed out black and whites may not be everyone's cup of tea but it conveys such a great sense of poverty that you can feel it. Lewis does really well although you have to wonder why Mullan didn't take the role himself given how similar Lewis came across to him. The rest of the cast are very real and you can't help but feel for Alice who has found herself taking tenners to take bottles up her rear just for another drink. Like I said  bleak in the extreme.", "Overall this is a really great short film that is impacting on several levels but mostly as a depiction of poverty and the trapped nature of those on the streets and trapped in alcoholism.

A feisty and impulsive creature, he has considerably more personality than Andy Panda and his antics provide much of GOODBYE MR. MOTH's spark.  He is definitely a pest, but he is nevertheless endearing not only because he is funny but because he lacks malice.  After all, he doesn't eat clothes for the heck of it but because they provide sustenance for him.  The moth doesn't speak, except in gibberish, but the Lantz crew provide him with such a drolly expressive face, he doesn't need dialogue.", "GOODBYE MR. MOTH is a delightful cartoon worth seeking out.  Lantz effects the gags at a breezy pace so even when they are average, they are efficiently delivered.  Since this cartoon was produced during World War II, there are a few wartime jokes such as when the holes of a shirt the moth has just eaten read \"Buy Defense Bonds.\"  As always in a Lantz cartoon of this vintage, the gags are punctuated by Darrel Calker's sprightly musical score. Indeed the theme used to open Andy Panda cartoons during this era is particularly rousing.  This theme, along with other choice cuts from Calker's work should be issued on CD."]},

I couldn't tell what any of the films were being spoofed but a couple of them looked like they could have been fun. The narration by Smith adds nothing simply because of how poorly written it was and I really couldn't tell if they were even trying to be funny with anything they said. The movie ran a very short 9-minutes but I kept looking at my clock every thirty-seconds or so because this thing was that unfunny. I don't think I've ever given a BOMB rating to a short mainly because the lower running doesn't torture you as much as a feature but this one here came quite close."]},

However, if that theory wasn't tested then there would be no film. In an effort to possibly win back his girlfriend (Kristy Swanson) who has left him because of his being irresponsible and has since taken up with another man, he offers to be a guardian for his traveling roommate's (Jon Stewart) son, Julian (portrayed by twins Cole and Dylan Sprouse). Agreeing to assume full responsibility for a child makes Sonny think that Swanson just might change her mind about leaving him. It doesn't happen and now child services won't let him return Julian. Sonny learns to grin and bear the situation by attempting to bond with Julian and in so doing, he gradually begins to feel more like an actual responsible father figure. Of course things get complicated when Stewart eventually returns home and a custody battle begins (Julian has grown attached to Sonny by this time). Even this dramatic seeming scene evolves into more adolescent comedy. Sandler's fans should enjoy this film but since I was never especially a fan of Sandler, I consider it to be just another crumbled up piece of paper in the sorry recent film comedy wastebasket."]},

Although I have 2 free passes in my mirror -- sent to me by one of the major theatres to pacify me when I complained about the lack of availability of this movie -- I don't want free tickets (that's why they're still in my mirror). I want freedom of choice -- of being able to see positive images of black people. Chances are you couldn't find \"Down in the Delta\" in the movies. I've purchased the DVD. I intend to purchase several more -- as well as the VHS -- to give to family members as gifts. I highly recommend this film!!"]},

This was the achievement of Mehboob Khan--the Cecil B. DeMille of India. ", "The casting was stellar: Ashok Kumar, Veena, Nargis, Chandra Mohan, Shah Nawaz, and K. N. Singh. All were nearly perfectly cast but a couple of performances fell short of the mark. The usually superb Chandra Mohan looked uncomfortable in his part which is surprising considering he played an excellent Emperor Jahangir in the 1939 epic PUKAR. The same can be said of Nargis. In all fairness to Nargis, she was very young here and still inexperienced in large scale film roles. Both Chandra Mohan and Nargis were overshadowed by the powerhouse presence of Veena in this film. In their scenes with Veena, both seemed edgy and uptight, which is a clear sign of actors who are not secure in their roles. Veena displays alternately a fiery and yet tender warrior princess which blows away the viewer. She somehow managed to go from a tigress to a dove in this role. How she achieved this, only Mehboob Khan could have known the answer. There never was an actress in the history of Hindi cinema who could deliver a dialogue like Veena or who had that inimitable voice. Ashok Kumar seems to be enjoying himself in the title role. He genuinely looks like he had fun playing this part. He was perfect for the part of Emperor Humayun. K. N. Singh played a real menacing part in this film and made his screen presence felt. Shah Nawaz made a regal and powerful Emperor Babur, founder of the Mughal Empire in India. A terrific supporting actor, Shah Nawaz had co-starred with Ashok Kumar in the diamond jubilee hit KISMET two years earlier in 1943, where he played a tough yet sympathetic police inspector which set the standard of important cop roles for decades to come by later character actors.", "In conclusion, HUMAYUN is a costume drama of epic proportions...Classic songs, great music, eloquent dialogue, opulent sets, spectacular battle scenes...This film has it all. For its cultural significance, as well as its commercial value, this film is a must see."]},

Not all the gags properly landed, especially the slightly too cutesy Manhattan Island sale and tired Gettysburg Address lampoon, and some of the dialogue is a little too corny like the Robert Fulton one.", "Didn't care for a few of the character designs, especially for Robert Fulton and Christopher Columbus.", "So much is good though. The music is lush and characterful throughout and a vast majority of the animation is excellent. Loved the extremely rich attention to detail in the backgrounds, especially in the Thomas Edison part, and Edison and George Washington are extremely well drawn. The story is non existent but this was a case of not caring about that when there was so much energy.", "While not all the humour works and nothing is hilarious (it also depends on how familiar you are with what is covered, the cartoon was very mixed in this regard), many of the gags are amusing and humorous.

Actually it looks like a cheap resort hotel from the '70's. And it's STARVED for extras. (One particularly awful number -- an utterly pointless 'drunk' duet that's about as funny as a hemorrhage -- is shot in a patio area with chairs stacked on the tables, because there's no one to sit in them.

On the other hand, his 'wise old rabbi' has perhaps the phoniest-looking beard in the history of motion pictures. It's colored grey, but not a grey that any human hair has ever been colored.", "In an insane attempt to be 'hip' (Did they think it would bring in younger audiences? Were they crazy?), there are actual disco numbers in Yiddish, with blase chorines in unitards and leg warmers \"dancing\" on a cheap platform stage.

But if you've stumbled upon this review, you know that no one involved in its production has a good record on that account. Menahem Golan's love of cheap trashy humor is in full effect here. The main plot revolves around two rival insurance salesmen (Katz and Carasso), the former of typical Ashkenazi background and the second, Sephardic. These cultural differences are played up and contrasted with the liberated and seemingly unprejudiced children. Katz has two daughters. The ambitious eldest daughter works for him and is trying to convince a potential client to sign on with her father. Carasso has two sons and his eldest is also in the family business working to convince the same client. This middle-aged client, however, is more interested in the swinging, liberated lifestyle of the younger generation than in contracts. Turns out, the children are more interested in each other than in business. In true simplistic Golan form, all predictable pairings consummate themselves in Eilat. This movie's great purely for a view of new \"60s\" Israel. Everyone is wearing the latest fashions and references abound to contemporaneous cultural changes. This movie is considered one of the \"Boorekas\" movies, a pejorative term for cheaply-made blockbusters that appealed to mass Israeli audiences. The humor is coarse but the heart is in the right place, sort of. For those really interested in Israeli culture, Rafi Nelson and his hippie collective make an extended appearance at the end of the film in a drug raid."]},

You heard about it. You read about it (specifically in monster books that talk about anything related to the Eighth Wonder of the World). Now finally you have an opportunity to see it! It is either available on disc one of the \"Woody Woodpecker Classic Cartoon Collection\" DVD set or on YouTube. It starts off when Pooch the Pup, who looks like a combination between Bimbo from those Betty Boop cartoons and Mickey Mouse, takes his unnamed girl-friend down to the jungle to film the title beast. However, after the Klunk is munching on a sacrifice, he finds Pooch's girl-friend and with the help of cupid arrow, he falls in love with her. Meanwhile Pooch is trying to avoid the victim of sacrifice that the giant ape rejected and before you know it, the majority of the film is spoofing the original 1933 RKO classic, from the battle with the Tyrannosaurus Rex to the attack at New York where he climbs the tallest building (called The Broken Arms). Walter Lantz cooks up the film with his creative humor such as inanimate objects that have minds of their own (like the movie camera, the cactus and the airplane), the 6 7/8 gag (which appears in later cartoon as 1951's \"slingshot 6 7/8\" and those Inspector Willouby cartoons where his badge reads 'Inspector 6 7/8') and the most original gag in this cartoon, the drum-chest gag. On another note, the monster's size keeps changing. One scene he is as big as the gate, then he is as big as the sea. In another scene his head and shoulders are sticking out of the water while his feet is at the bottom. For the city scene, the gorilla's height is as big as the stage and then in the next scene he is holding the entire building above his head (must be \"the think strong to be strong\" technique which appeared in later cartoons). When he's chasing the people, the buildings are up to his legs and the panicking crowd are like ants. When he is holding Pooch's girl friend, the buildings are about his size, especially before he climbs up the building. This cartoon only aired on TV in the 1950's, but it never aired in the \"Woody Woodpecker Show\" (1988-1994). Why?! What's the matter? Is it because of the portrayal of the natives in this short are too racist? Is it because you are afraid of showing you early pre-Woody works from the 20's and 30's in fear that people will find them too boring? It worked on shows like \"Donald Duck Presents\", \"Looney Tunes on Nickelodeon\" and \"The Popeye Show\". Why can't you show it to the new generation of audiences, because black and white cartoons fascinated my brother and I when we were kids! Or is because you want nothing but Woody Woody Woody, so you can create a new generation of trouble makers to drive people of all ages bananas! Rant aside, this film should of been a short subject to the unmade Universal film, \"The Legend of King Kong\" (if Universal only bought the rights of original) or Peter Jackson's remake. Before I end this review, I would like to say that I uploaded for various reasons: 1. Because that DVD set is too expensive and I don't have any equipment to capture DVD footage to the computer. 2. I found a link to download it. 3. I stopped liking Woody Woodpecker when I was 10 because he was too mischievous. He caused nothing but trouble, drove people up the wall and gave maturity and growing up a bad name! Like \"Hook Line and Stinker\" (1969), where he was fishing and drove the guy next to him bananas and at the end, he was sobbing because he wanted some peace and quiet. Shame on you Woody!

The 1929-1930 batches of Walter Lantz-directed Oswald cartoons were a mixed bag, with some good, some forgettable and not much special and a few mediocre. The 1931 batch was mostly underwhelming, with only 6 out of 18 cartoons being above average or more. The 1932 batch had a few not so good, though the cartoons in question were nothing compared to the worst of the previous 3 years, cartoons, but most were decent to good and some even very good. The 1933 batch is one of the most consistent, with the weakest 'Beau Best' still being decent.", "There hasn't been a dud yet in the 1934 batch of cartoons, despite what the low rating here indicates (though this is down to lack of votes than anything else). Do think in some way that 'Kings Up' though is weaker than what came before while having a lot of obvious merits.", "'Kings Up' has a few less than great elements. The story is hardly one at all, with the first half being a series essentially of song and dance sequences. Premise-wise it reminded me a little of the superior Mickey Mouse cartoon 'Ye Olden Days.", "Pacing is uneven, coming to life in the second half, when there is more of a story and far less set-up, but not quite as momentum-filled (though not dull) in the first half. The characters are not hugely memorable, although still entertaining, outside of Oswald and the villain, and although there is nothing to be offended by there is a very brief racial stereotype early on.", "However, the animation is very good. There is the looser and more elaborate look of many of the previous Lantz era Oswald cartoons, but it was surprising and lovely to see parts of the animation reminding one of the animation style of the Disney years in places.", "Love the music too, which is very characterful and beautifully orchestrated and performed. The song that fills up most of 'Kings Up' is impossible to get out of your head and is sung wonderfully. The dancing and synchronisation is entertaining and looks very natural in the animation, while there are some amusing and well timed if never hilarious moments.", "The more story-oriented second half is quite exciting, even if it is not exactly surprising as to how the cartoon will end. Oswald is endearing.", "All in all, one of those decent if unexceptional cartoons. 6/10 Bethany Cox"]},

Mother Nature was overly generous to the sweet, large bosomed Ms Hickey.", "After computer generated titles that appear to have been written by someone who couldn't spell to save their life (unless we're meant to be watching a film 'staring Zoe Lee'), Zoe/Pauline arrives at the door of 'Grimballs Kissogram Agency' looking for work. Of course Grimballs owner, who resembles a young Bob Carolgees, is only too happy to offer her a job, but there's a problem 'I've never done a striptease beforein fact I've never even seen one' Pauline tells him, a somewhat unlikely claim from a woman whose breasts appear to rest on her knees. The solution is for our Pauline to be shipped off to a country manor for the weekend on a 'kissogram training course', along with several other women all of whom sport equally huge breasts. Here 'training' to become the crème de la crème of the Kissogram profession consists of the girls taking showers, early morning jogs and lots of running on the spot, all under the supervision of a prim and proper 'schoolmarm' type called Jenny who promises Pauline 'plenty of exercise and gym will get you moving around'. Indeed it does, the dubious highlight of these excuses for showing the girls' breasts bouncing all over the place being the exercise sequence which takes place on the grounds of the manor and has the girls topless lifting weights, doing push-ups and other such aerobics. The girls all look freezing cold and tired out but manage a few fake smiles for the camera; only an Englishman could have concocted such a miserable, desperately unsexy spectacle.", "A vague sense of a plot is established when Jenny bursts into a striptease rehearsal to bitch about the girl's less than flattering clothes ('you lot are meant to be turning men on, they're gonna wish they stayed at home with the wife when they see you'). Nobly the film draws our attention to the plight of big busted women's inability to find sexy clothes by having one of the girls reply 'they don't make pretty bras for big girls like us, just because we've got big tits, they think we're big and sexless'. Inspired to right this injustice, Jenny goes to a lingerie shop to chat to the manager Matt. When she confronts Matt with Pauline and the other girls' 'special bra requirements' he pulls a shocked face then delivers the film's funniest remark '42 inches that's a yard'. Jenny ends up trying on some sexy clothes herself with a little help from the touchy feely Matt in a plot detour that is actually out of the norm for the film's one track mind given that the actress has normal sized breasts and there's a suggestion, shock, horror, of sex.", "In comparison the rest of Kissogram Girls is an asexual little thing, with much in common with a 60's nudist camp production, the girls jog around naked allot but thats about it. In the strange, alternate universe of Sexy Secrets of the Kissogram Girls women with big breasts are held in such high regard that literally anything they do is judged a worthy cinematic subject, resulting in such non-scenes as 'big breasted women examine the contents of a suitcase' and 'big breasted women apply make-up in front of a mirror'. The nearest to an erotic thrill the girls get during the weekend is for a pair of hands to massage their breasts in the bath at one point, but even this is carried out with all the passion of someone kneading dough.", "Director Peter Kay made a long (and presumably profitable) career out of tapes that exploited the fetish of well-endowed British girls, shooting more than 60 like minded videos throughout the 1980s and early 1990s. General ineptitude, large breasts, and Top of the Pops-style visual effects are some of the hallmarks of the Kay output, with musical accompaniment that sounds suspiciously like the director's Gran trying out her new electronic keyboard being another. This is not to say Sexy Secrets of the Kissogram Girls isn't entertaining, on the contrary its a very,very,very funny once seen never forgotten viewing experience and if the shelves of a certain music chain are creaking from the strain of countless DVD copies of Doris Wishman's Deadly Weapons and Double Agent 73 I see no reason why punters should remain in the dark about the British equivalent.", "Kay was obviously proud of his achievement and the tape's sleeve notes-which are a classic in their own right-present the film as if it were the video sexploitation equivalent of Orson Welles' War of the Worlds radio broadcast. Claiming that the film's shooting 'caused an uproar in staid old Exmouth, front page in the local papers (sic),interviews on local radio and London's capital radio'- clearly this was big news indeed! Seen today the best thing about Sexy Secrets of the Kissogram Girls is of course mascot Pauline Hickey, who's name might still be mud in Exmouth but remains a cute girl next door type with a voice to match, her pigeon toed walking in the opening scene is also unique. Regrettably this is pretty much the extent of Pauline's film work, although a handful of stripping short films featuring her, as well as long outtakes from Kissogram Girls are out there, not forgetting her appearance in an hysterical 'lets-just-hope-they-were-being-tongue-in-cheek' advert for Electric Blue T-shirts. Of course Pauline was no actress, but she does wear a bemused half smile throughout the film and swings her breasts around in an energetic fashion, both of which seem agreeable under the circumstances."]},

Now do the same thing again but this time it is its between persons Y and Z. Now editing everything together but cutting person Y totally out of the movie. You get two people talking to each other about the same thing, but the two sides of the conversations don't sync up and are just a little different from each other.

Fascinating to see the old city before the developments of recent years and at 80 minutes this doesn't let up and there are many fine moments including a fight atop a steam train, seemingly running through Yokohama and a bust up in what looked like a marionette warehouse. The extending opening sequence is particularly effective with street fortune teller and meeting in cramped room light by passing trains and culminating in naked death. Well worth seeking out, as I'm sure would be others in the series."]},

The limited number of locations never feels constrictive, as Deveau and his actors imbue them with such a keen sense of place that film feels like a time capsule 45 years later. While his roster of characters is similarly limited, Deveau also has a sharp eye for casting, scoring big with both Frank and Burns as emblems of the newly-liberated '70s homosexual. If there's any weak point, it's Rikas, who comes off kind of dull, though even that aloofness fits his character. All the actors figures are suitably alluring and are well-shot by Deveau, with a particular highlight being a long, languid take of the gorgeous Frank trying on and then lounging around his apartment in a pair of deliciously revealing designer briefs.", "A wonderful time capsule of the potential still held by pornographic cinema at the dawn of the '70s, LEFT-HANDED is both serious and playful, a fascinating relic of a unique era of artistic and sexual liberation as well as a still-arousing porn film that features a troika of gorgeous studs.

That intolerance is solely because of social groupings as opposed to the people as individuals. Each story tells of the group in power who use that power to quash a popular uprising--usually with violence--and the affect that it has on a young couple who just want to live largely in peace. The movie moves from story to story, cutting from one to another during moments similar to the two stories. But overriding the entire proceeding is the Eternal Mother, who is seen rocking the cradle of the human race.", "Four tales from director ", " show how intolerance and hatred have affected mankind through the ages. In the first tale a young girl, the Dear One and her father are forced to move to the city after he loses his job at a local mill. The Dear One faces a hard life after her husband is falsely convicted. In the second tale, the Pharisees ignore Jesus Christ's message of love and protection and refuse to help him. In the third tale, a young Huguenot couple, Brown Eye and Prosper Latour, prepare for their wedding in 1572 Paris unaware of the plans to eliminate the Protestant sect. Finally, the last story looks at a young mountain girl of ancient Babylon in 539 B.C. who falls in love.", "Griffith's design for this film is to juxtapose four stories from different periods of history that illustrate \"Love's struggle throughout the ages.\" These include a selection of events from the life of Jesus; a tale from ancient Babylon, whose king is betrayed by those who resent his rejection of religious sectarianism; the story of the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre of French Protestants by King Charles the IX of France on the perfidious advice of his mother; and a modern story in which a young boy, wrongly convicted of the murder of a companion, is rescued from execution at the last minute by the intervention of his beloved, who gains a pardon from the governor. These stories are not presented in series. Instead, Griffith cuts from one to another and often introduces suspenseful crosscutting with the stories as well."]},

Finlayson plays a guy named Julius who spends most of his time on extended hunting trips, neglecting his wife. When she is lured away by an enterprising \"He-Flirt\" (played by dapper Tyler Brooke) Julius tries to fight at first, then gives up, attempts suicide, and winds up drinking heavily in a sleazy waterfront dive. Just when the story's getting depressing, Charley Chase shows up for a brief, uncredited appearance as a bizarre hobo in a top-hat, to perk things along. Ultimately Julius cooks up a scheme to impersonate a fortune teller, and thereby manipulate his wife and her lover into doing his bidding. At first he wants vengeance, but once he's lured the couple to a graveyard he and his wife find common ground once again, amid some eerie goings-on.", "Stan Laurel was the assistant director on this film, and although he didn't get a writing credit something tells me he contributed some of the weird gags that highlight the graveyard finale, such as the giant caretaker who exits skipping like a \"pansy\" (to use the period term). Other gags suggest the Sennett approach to comedy, such as the use of tiny animated stars swirling around a performer's head after he gets clunked, or the conveniently located vat of whitewash that turns Finn into a \"ghost.\" This was the sort of familiar shtick that the better Roach comedies were leaving behind, but somehow in this case it's punched across with such panache it's not stale but amusing.

King Constant (John Gielgud) was the first christian King of England, but could not keep the country together as it plunged into civil war. The crown changed hands very quickly. Pagan sites were also defiled, riling the followers of the old ways.\nQueen Mab (Miranda Richardson) (born of magic and sister to the Lady of the Lake) seeks to reclaim her power by drawing people back to the \"Old Ways\". The lady of the lake refuses to help Mab, as she accepts her fate that she will die when the people forget about the old Gods. To do so, she creates a wizard named Merlin, whom she intends to champion her crusade. Merlin's mother dies giving birth to him and he is raised by his guardian, Ambrosia (Billie Whitelaw) (Ambrosia used to serve Mab, but is now a Christian and agrees to take care of Merlin), until his magic emerges.", "Years later, a teenage Merlin recounts to Ambrosia how he has rescued a nobleman's daughter, Nimue (Isabella Rossellini) (daughter of Lord Ardente (John McEnery)), from drowning by magically growing a small branch. Ambrosia tells him of his past and he is sent to Mab to begin his training with Frik (Martin Short) (who teaches him in the 3 stages of wizardry), Mab's gnome servant; however, Merlin has little interest in helping Mab's crusade to restore the Old Ways, angering her.\nMerlin finds out from the Lady of the Lake (Miranda Richardson) (who came to visit him secretly during his training) that her sister Mab let his birth mother die and that Ambrosia is ill. Mab reaches Ambrosia's home before Merlin, but when Ambrosia refuses to convince Merlin to return to Mab, Mab lashes out mortally injuring Ambrosia. Merlin tries to attack Mab but can't defeat her; she coldly dismisses the deaths of his mother and Ambrosia as \"casualties of war\" and vows that Merlin will help her in her quest for power. Merlin makes a blood-oath never to use magic.", "Many years pass. Merlin is brought before the tyrant King Vortigern (Rutger Hauer), who is having problems constructing his castle (Mab had told Vortigen that his castle would stand if he mixes Merlin's blood in the mortar). Merlin tells the king his vision: a crimson dragon representing Uther Pendragon (Mark Jax) defeats the white dragon that represents Vortigern. Vortigen imprisons Merlin, but Nimue argues for his release (as only Merlin can tell Vortigen how to defeat Uther, who has just attacked England). In their time alone, Nimue tells Merlin about the Holy Grail.\nMab tells the king that he can vanquish Uther by sacrificing Nimue (Vortigen had captured Nimue to ensure the loyalty of Ardente's forces towards him) to a dragon (she wants Merlin in return), in the hope that Merlin will break his vow not to use magic. Merlin uses magic to save Nimue (but she is still singed by the dragon) and she is sent to Avalon to recover from her burns. Merlin asks the Lady of the Lake for help, and she gives him the magical sword Excalibur.", "Merlin warns Uther of Vortigern's intention to attack him under the cover of winter; Uther heeds Merlin's warning and uses Excalibur to defeat the king in battle. Vortigen's army surrenders at the death of its master.\nUther becomes obsessed with Igraine (Rachel De Thame), the wife of Gorlois, Lord of Cornwall. Merlin tricks Uther out of the sword (with the pretext of using it to get Igraine to fall in love with him) and plunges it into the Rock of Ages (James Earl Jones), who promises to keep it until a good man can withdraw it. Uther's mind is plagued by madness and lust, and Britain slides back into civil war. Merlin strikes a deal with Uther to let him bed Igraine in exchange for guardianship of the son born from the union, and for Gorlois and his men to be spared. Merlin transforms Uther's appearance into that of Gorlois, fooling everyone in Tintagel Castle except for Igraine's young daughter, Morgan Le Fay (Helena Bonham Carter). Uther later has Gorlois and his men slaughtered, deliberately going-back on his word to Merlin.", "While Igraine is in labor, at Mab's behest, Frik convinces Morgan to place a black stone beneath the baby's sheets in his crib. Igraine gives birth to Arthur (Paul Curran). Mab then confronts Merlin, proclaiming Arthur to be damned, but Merlin vows to raise him in the ways of good and hopes Arthur will help bring her down.\nArthur is tutored by Merlin. Uther continues to sink yet-further into his madness and later commits suicide, leaving the kingdom in turmoil. The noblemen in the kingdom try to take Excalibur from the Rock of Ages, but none can until Merlin presents Arthur, who is allowed to take the sword.", "After some initial hostility, the nobles unite behind Arthur as their rightful king. Merlin leaves, thinking the kingdom is finally at peace, but Mab instructs Frik to seek out Morgan (Helena Bonham Carter) and poison her mind by making her beautiful, and has her seduce Arthur, who is unaware of their relationship (that they are step siblings). Merlin races back to Camelot to confront Arthur. Morgan gives birth to Mordred (Jason Done), whom Mab raises to become Arthur's downfall. Arthur starts construction of his castle of Camelot and marries Guinevere (Lena Headey).\nMerlin pays a visit to Morgan and begs her not to teach the old ways to Mordred. But Morgan is angry at Merlin for choosing Uther and then helping him seduce her mother and killing her father. She will see to Arthur's downfall.\nArthur decides to take his knights on a quest for the Holy Grail, so he holds a tournament to crown a champion who will defend and complete Camelot in his absence. The Lady of the Lake vows to guide Merlin to a man worthy of being Camelot's guardian. Merlin meets a boy, Galahad, and his parents, Lancelot (Jeremy Sheffield), a skilled rider and swordsman, and Elaine of Astolat, Lancelot's wife. Merlin brings Lancelot to Camelot, where he wins the tournament.", "In Arthur's absence, Guinevere and Lancelot embark on a love affair. Mab makes sure Elaine sees his betrayal (in a magic mirror), and she is found dead at the shores of Camelot not long after. Lancelot flees Camelot in his guilt and shame. Arthur and his knights return, their quest a failure.\nMordred introduces himself as Arthur's son and heir and reveals Guinevere's betrayal to all. Arthur is forced to condemn her to be burned at the stake for treason, but relents and has Merlin save her before she is harmed, causing him to lose respect among the younger nobles. Lancelot rides back to Camelot to save her, both of them riding away into exile.", "Mordred raises an army among those dissatisfied with Arthur and Merlin. Meanwhile, Frik and Morgan have fallen in love. When Morgan refuses to allow Mab to further use Mordred for her own ends, Mab kills her. Frik vows revenge on Mab and she takes his powers away.\nMab creates an idyllic wilderness home for Nimue, and asks her to persuade Merlin to stay there with her, hoping to stop him intervening in the coming battle. Wanting to be with him, Nimue agrees and sends for Merlin.", "The armies of Mordred and Arthur begin the Battle of Camlann, where many on both sides are slain. Arthur defeats Mordred and kills him, but Mordred deals Arthur a fatal blow. Sensing his protege is dying, Merlin leaves Nimue to go to Arthur. Mab's creation seals itself behind him, parting Merlin from Nimue. At the battlefield, Mab's magic is unable to save Mordred, and Arthur lives long enough to tell Merlin to return Excalibur to the place it was found. Merlin gives back the sword to the Lady of the Lake. She tells Merlin she is slowly dying as the Old Ways are rejected and forgotten. Merlin accuses her of lying to him about the guardian of Camelot, but she explains that it was Galahad who was the true guardian and could have averted all this, though she assures Merlin that Arthur's death is not his fault. Merlin encounters Frik among the survivors of Arthur's army, who warns him that although Mab is greatly weakened, she is still dangerous.", "Merlin confronts Mab at Camelot but the ensuing magical duel ends in stalemate. Mab sneers that she is invulnerable to conventional means of destruction, but Merlin responds that she will be defeated when she is forgotten. Mab slowly fades into nothing as Merlin, Frik and the entire court of Camelot turn their backs on her and walk away.\nMerlin is again shown back in the \"present\" finishing his story. Frik appears along with Merlin's aged magic horse, who Frik says will take him to Nimue. Frik explains that some time after Mab disappeared, the spells she had cast lost their effectiveness, and Nimue was set free. Merlin finds the elderly Nimue at Ambrosia's old forest home. He manages one last act of magic to restore them both to youth so they can live out their lives together."]},

Indeed, the digital reconstruction of this one was the result of a fragmentary nitrate print from the U.S. Library of Congress combined with a nearly-complete 16mm copy from the National Film and Sound Archive of Australia. While ending the festival with slapstick seemed aimed at lifting people's spirits these days when a pandemic has limited travel, including to Pordenone to see these films theatrically and in person with others, it's also nice to be reminded of international cooperation that isn't deadly, but rather preserves our shared culture and history."]},

Thousands have died an agonizing death in hopes of just a glimpse of what you're about to see!' Those words are spoken by Boris Balkan, moments before he sets himself on fire in an attempt to raise the devil. The Ninth Gate is not only a movie about occultism, it is an occult movie by itself. First there is of course the obvious story that most people find quite disappointing BUT under the surface there is the real story that is only understood by those who are fairly familiar with symbolism and occultism. ", "Although The Ninth gate is based on just a part of the book El Club Dumas, it is nevertheless a clever story of its own. ", "The movie is about a riddle that is supposed to be hidden in three books, in the end that riddle is solved by Dean Corso. The movie itself contains a riddle and that riddle is to be solved by us. Besides the engravings, lots of symbolism and hints will help us understand the meaning of several strange events and eventually the meaning of what the story is all about and what happened to Balkan and Corso. The plot is created around a joke, a joke that is based on a misunderstanding. This makes a movie that one needs to see more than once, I bought the DVD and saw it over twenty times. The story gets better every time you watch it, pay attention to even the smallest details like the color of the mysterious girl's socks, there is a good reason why Corso has a shoulder bag and an overcoat he never seems to part from, until the 'notorious' very last scene; shoulder bag and overcoat are gone... Aren't you curious about the meaning of broken glasses in combination of a mark between the eyes? Search the internet for the answers to the questions you have.

As I was watching it in the theater, I had the feeling of watching a photograph develop.  It lets you take in a little at a time, but you can't keep your eyes off it.  Tony Barbieri's direction is very subtle, and full of depth. I really admired some of the evocative camera angles.  There were several shots in the movie that place us, the audience, outside the scenes.  For instance, the camera is positioned outside a door to a room where two characters are having a conversation.  It made me feel like I was eavesdropping on someone.  It also created a feeling of restriction. These shots were offset by a few others which place the characters in wide open spaces (a beach or a baseball field), which suggest potential for growth. Both of these themes (restriction and potential) are very much what \"One\" is about.", "Again, I hope more people see this film and post their comments!  I really hate being the only one up here!

But what makes this film one of its kind is the best ever cast which includes Leonov, Gundareva, Bogatyrev, Ukupchenko and Oleg Dal, a genius actor. The film is set in a typical Soviet Union urban city with gloomy construction landscapes which is the best reflection of the time being described. The film describes \"the morning after \"of the main character, engineer Zilov, who, having woken up, finds the funeral wreath at his place – his friends' present. This rather symbolic joke makes him recollect the previous night as well as 2 last months. With the events developing the viewer finds himself totally involved in this merely recollection which is gradually transformed into a deep analysis and soul-searching. As well as the protagonist we are invited to look intently and unvarnishedly at the most unpleasant, unattractive and sometimes repulsive features of the main character. But at the same time we can't help noticing how frank and fearless Zilov is in his determined decision to go up to the end whatever it is. Standing out of others, he just emphasize on the similarity with them. And only his willing to understand his own nature differs him from the others, who symbolically present the whole society of that time. And miraculously the funeral wreath turns into a crown of the winner. Apart from the Dal's absolutely brilliant performance, the other actors' one is totally believable. Although, the plot is quite complicated and full of symbols to be realized, the film is definitely worth seeing it. It will appeal to everyone who is interested in serious, thought-provoking movies as well as to those who adore Oleg Dal's acting."]},

An overview inclined to showcase part of the legal procedure taken against the actress, most of the focus is on the lawyer, the prosecution and the star herself who managed to use such exposition to reveal her comic and dramatic talents on the stand. Trust me, she was hilarious. But until we get to those fun bits, most of the trial is just talk after talk, very tiresome and the biased narrator who pops from time to time, deeply inclined to criticize Gabor - and there's a damaging part where anonymous people are asked if they know any of the actress films and none of them knew any of her projects (I'm not a big fan but I knew at least a few titles to answer if such question was made to me).", "Fascination came to me while watching \"The People vs. Zsa Zsa Gabor\" just to take a peak and have a real feel of what court procedures really work. Hollywood isn't much far from reality except from creating tension where there isn't none, but it's basically the same thing: drama, strange humor, confusion and plenty of unusual moments that only fiction can make it interesting. In the case versus Gabor it was highly unusual (and amusing) when she had to demonstrate the whole incident by getting out of the stand and with her lawyer playing the cop at the same time he asked questions about directions, positions, what was said in what they called \"the alleged slapping\". And there's also the classic media circus we all see on film but in this one whenever Zsa Zsa criticized the cop or anything, the judge was quick in action to cut her remarks. Her sense of humor was pure class despite all the problems faced here but as we all know, she lost the case and faced a minor penalty. There's so many good elements in this trial that a movie recreation of it is made necessary. A dramatic comedy that would be one of a kind. ", "I won't deliver any opinion on who's right or wrong since we only get a glimpse of events/trial, the documentary favors the showy cop for a long time at the same time Gabor reveals what feels like a clear case of excessive force by the police; it's hard to tell. You watch and be the judge. 8/10"]},

While not exactly imaginative, other cartoons have similar concepts and do more with them, the gags are still very amusing and much of the pacing is lively with good synchronisation.", "Oswald has lost none of his endearing factor and the support characters are pretty fun.", "In conclusion, pretty good and better than most of the 1931 batch of Oswald cartoons. 7/10 Bethany Cox"]},

Some of the animation, although not exactly refined and with some jumpy transitions here and there, is not bad at all, are crisp and fluid enough with some nice detail especially with animation techniques still in early days. The ballet dance and a few of Oswald's tricks are amusing, and there is some nice energy in some of the music.", "However, synchronisation between music and sound effects and how they fit with the images has been much better before and since and far less sloppy too.

It is not one of Woody's funniest cartoons and story-wise it is on the formulaic side with the pacing to begin with not being as sharp as other cartoons of his.", "Luckily, Woody carries the cartoon very well with good comic timing and a personality that does annoy Buzz but doesn't annoy the viewer too much. Buzz is a worthy partner, although one doesn't feel sympathy for him as much as we do for Wally. The two work well together, and the lengths they go to get the girl's affections and the whole stuff involving Woody's scalp are a lot of fun to watch.", "As ever, the animation is very good. The characters are well drawn, but even better are the rich colours, meticulously detailed backgrounds and smooth backgrounds.", "Music is another strength here. It's characterful, lushly orchestrated and is not only dynamic with the action it even enhances it. 'Scalp Treatment' is very amusing and well-timed, with the second half being typically wild. Most of the pacing is fine, with it coming to life after a slightly slow start once the conflict is introduced.", "On the whole, solid and fun cartoon. 8/10 Bethany Cox"]},

Last time I looked, there were situations and realities in the world far more dangerous and harmful than drawings made on a series of cels more than 60 years ago.  I don't like or agree with a lot of what I see here and elsewhere, but no cartoon (or movie, song, book, et cetera) can hurt me without my consent.

That's not the same as saying it's a laugh riot, for they made plenty of other shorts that are funnier or more appealing, but it nonetheless holds a special place in the series' history, and once you've experienced Seeing the World you're not likely to forget it.", "The premise of this short is that the gang's teacher Jimmy Finlayson— affectionately known as \"Old Buzz-Fuzz\" —has won a popularity contest and therefore wins a trip to Europe. The kids come to the dock to see him off, but then slip on-board the ship, stow away, and join their beloved instructor on his cross-continent tour. What follows is basically a travelogue with jokes: Finlayson guides his little charges through the ruins of Pompeii, St. Peter's in Rome, over the canals of Venice by gondola, past Buckingham Palace and through Trafalgar Square in London. They wind up in Paris for glimpses of Napoleon's Tomb, Notre Dame, and ultimately the Eiffel Tower. All of these places (and more) are covered in the whirlwind trip, all in the course of an eighteen minute two- reeler! Along the way the kids engage in some mild rough-housing but are generally well-behaved and respectful, occasionally making inadvertent jokes about what they're seeing. In Venice, for example, little Farina observes: \"Man wants a bath in this town all he gotta do is fall out the window.\"", "Perhaps the most interesting thing about Seeing the World is that, in reality, the kids never went to Europe at all! Leonard Maltin reports in his definitive book on the Our Gang series that only star comic Jimmy Finlayson and director Robert McGowan made the trip along with a small crew. They brought along the kid's outfits, however, and hired suitable local children to wear them and appear with Finn in long shots. When the filmmakers returned to Culver City with their footage they shot close-ups with the real gang on mock-up sets in the studio. (And I'll bet the kids were steamed they didn't get to go!) Even if this information hadn't been revealed in the Maltin book a sharp-eyed viewer would probably suspect something of the sort. Finlayson is recognizable in the location shots, but it's noticeable in the \"landmark\" scenes that the kids are always shown from a distance, often with their backs to the camera. During an extended sequence in a Venetian gondola it's clear that although the shots of Finn are real, the interspersed shots involving Farina, Joe, Jackie, and the others were filmed using fairly sophisticated process work.", "Considering the elaborate trickery involved it's impressive that Seeing the World works as well as it does. The experience is rather like watching someone's home movie travel footage irreverently narrated with wisecracks. Also of interest: Stan Laurel contributes a funny cameo as a passerby in the London sequence. (In later years Stan didn't recall appearing in this film and asserted that he'd never been in an Our Gang comedy, but inasmuch as he doesn't interact with the children during his brief scene it's possible the bit was filmed for another project.) Finlayson gives his characteristic broad performance as the schoolmaster, perhaps just a tad more restrained than usual.", "All in all, this two-reeler is an eccentric little treat for Our Gang fans, though it's a far cry from their best efforts. The travelogue aspect will be a plus for travel-oriented viewers who enjoy that sort of thing, while buffs interested in cinematic trickery will want to watch for the clever editing job."]},

The Tale of Tsar Saltan is one such story, and makes for a beautifully done animated adaptation. The animation on the whole is very nicely done, some of the character animation is a little stiff sometimes and maybe the two sisters and aunt are stereotypically drawn but the traditional story-book-like backgrounds and simple and elegant colours are lovely to look at. The music is lilting and elegiac, very Russian folk-tale-like in style, definitely one of those soundtracks that if there was a CD of it I'd buy it with no hesitation. The story is moving and charming with all the elements and plot-lines of the original story/poem intact, it moves at a deliberately stoic pace but doesn't feel dull or too padded out, each scene has a purpose and the slower scenes allow for more intimacy with the characters. The narration has a suitably understated sincerity, it makes its point and doesn't have anything irrelevant or any clumsy attempts of humour or breaking-the-fourth-wall as it is a story that doesn't require those latter qualities. The characters are ones that you immediately recognise and they are engaging, while the voice acting is good, sometimes with moments of it being broad but mostly it's noble. Overall, beautifully done animated Russian folk-tale. 9/10 Bethany Cox"]},

Not to mention Universal took Oswald away from Disney a couple years before this and kept at it anyway. I know that it might seem unfair to compare another short to Disney from the period as if he and Iwerks were the only ones making animated movies, but having gone through almost all of the early shorts Disney/Iwers were doing at the time, the similarities are uncanny (aside from that one specific example, the short with the Halloween theme in the graveyard has a similar tone).

A good portion of the early action revolves around the difficulties the pilots go through to make their way back to the home islands from theaters of war they no longer control which does emphasize the dire straights the empire found itself in and the desperation of their cause at that point in time.", "Mifune is effective as the commander who is adamant that the suicide kamikaze squadrons being organized are a waste of resources, although he isn't around much in the film with the bulk of the story revolving around his junior flight leaders. What's a bit surprising is the candor the film expresses at the unrelenting losses being experienced by the pounding they are taking from Allied forces, with the addition of a neat segment on the sinking of the Yamato in a cool side story. Unfortunately the film is ultimately undone by cheap special effects and model work that frankly make the SFX of a second tier Son of Godzilla movie seem like Avatar.

The cuts back and forth show it as night at the ghost town but broad daylight to the police cruiser on route.", "Featured in ", " (2002)", "1962's \"Terrified\" was one of several Crown International pictures that debuted on Pittsburgh's Chiller Theater in 1976 (February 19, 1977 to be exact), paired with second feature \"Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte,\" from 1964. A production whose poverty stricken budget restricts the settings to a deserted Western ghost town and its creepy cemetery, but with a script that would have been commonplace some two decades later during the teen slasher cycle of the early 1980s. Directed by serial veteran Lew Landers, whose prior features included 1935's \"The Raven\" and 1943's \"The Return of the Vampire\" (both with Lugosi), a rather fitting conclusion to a busy career as an action specialist, although it cannot claim to be well paced. The idea of a hooded maniac stalking his victims has become quite a cliché since the early sixties, but this appears to be the first horror film that used it. We begin at the ghost town's cemetery with a helpless screaming victim lying in an open grave as his unknown tormentor pours cement over him, driving him insane. Next, we meet our tiny cast in a small coffee shop, who drive back to the deserted cemetery and discover the still warm corpse of the caretaker, obviously a victim of murder. As the young couple drive away to contact the sheriff (Denver Pyle), their friend, Ken Lewis (Rod Lauren, \"The Crawling Hand\"), inexplicably remains behind, stubbornly facing up to his own fears as he loses just about every scuffle with the hooded killer, who delights in terrorizing his prey, all of whom have close ties to Marge (Tracy Olsen), the sister of the first victim (who has conveniently escaped the asylum to go after his assailant). Once everyone convenes at the ghost town, the film remains just as trapped as the frightened characters, who simply don't behave in the most logical fashion, especially Ken, who seems to be under the impression that the killer is Marge's brother. There is one major subplot that is dropped halfway in, that of a crazed motorist who delights in running people off the road. This is how the sheriff first becomes involved, but nothing ever comes of it, and no explanation is offered as to who it was, except that it's not the character under the hood, an unforgivable sin. The killer's identity is hardly a major surprise, and Italian horror films quickly adopted the idea of a hooded maniac (1964's \"Blood and Black Lace\"), but it remains an interesting artifact ahead of its time, all but forgotten today. Chiller Theater aired this film three more times as a solo feature, on August 11 1979, July 26 1980, and October 10 1981, with much of the Crown International catalog scarcely seen on the airwaves since (\"Twisted Brain\" aka \"Horror High\" lasted the longest, long championed by Elvira)."]},

Instead of shock value, he holds the audience's attention with whimsical flights of pseudo sci-fi fantasy, and enough twists and turns in the plot to cause some surprises, and intentional and amusing confusion. Takita's typically skillful direction, along with some inventive cinematography and set design, the lovely starlets, and interesting sex scenes make this an enjoyable, if minor production in its genre."]},

Jimmy Finlayson, Glenn Tryon, and Tyler Brooke were each given a try-out but failed to make the grade as a leading player, although of course Finlayson later found his niche as a great foil to Laurel & Hardy. Wandering Papas was a vehicle for Australian comic Clyde Cook, a goofy little guy in baggy pants who looked like a cross between Finlayson and Ben Turpin.", "Cook was a former stage clown, and I must confess that while watching him in this short I was reminded of the clowns at Ringling Brothers shows, the ones who'd perform vigorous pratfalls, slop buckets of suds on each other, and chase each other around the ring, but without making me laugh -- past the age of 6, anyhow. You get the sense that what you're watching is supposed to be funny, but somehow it isn't, and I think it's because this sort of clown lacks an identifiable personality. He exists to be funny and for no other reason, thus, no matter how well executed, the comedy feels hollow.", "Consider the early scene where Cook, who plays the chef at a railroad construction gang's camp, goes to a nearby lake to catch fish for supper. Cook dutifully performs his allotted gags (trying to catch a fish with flypaper, etc.) and executes some good falls, but somehow it doesn't register. Then he goes hunting for rabbit, but comedy-wise the results aren't any more effective. Compare the sequence to Buster Keaton's The Balloonatic, a short comedy released a couple of years before this one. When Buster goes fishing and hunting, it's funny. His gags are stronger, but the real difference is that Buster has a recognizably human persona and his behavior is dictated by the demands of his character. Clyde Cook, on the other hand, does whatever he or his gag writers thought might get a laugh. When he catches a skunk instead of a rabbit he doesn't know the difference (what is he, a moron?) and takes it back to camp with predictable results, but the whole routine feels lame. Cook, unlike Keaton, lacks personality.", "Perhaps as insurance the folks who made this film cast Tyler Brooke in a supporting role. As noted above, Brooke was another up-and-coming comic that Hal Roach hoped to promote to stardom, but he isn't given much to do in Wandering Papas. (And by the way, if anyone has a theory concerning the meaning of the title I'd like to hear it). Brooke serves as love interest, romancing the daughter of a surly guy who lives near the construction site. In the end, the lovers elope and wind up on a runaway train with the angry father and our lead comic, Cook. The chase finale is nicely handled. The train rolls wildly along a mountain track and then derails in such a way that Cook and the angry father are dangling from a railroad car over a chasm. The sequence is well-edited and suspenseful, but it might have been something really special if we cared more about the fate of these characters; that's the difference between light entertainment and classic comedy.", "Speaking of comedians with personality, there's one other supporting player of note: Oliver Hardy, who plays a construction worker. Hardy, who looks incredibly boyish here, has a good scene with Cook in the dining hall when he requests more flapjacks simply by giving the chef a series of eloquent looks. Within a year or so of appearing in this film, Hardy would begin making some of the last great comedies of the silent era in collaboration with the director of Wandering Papas, the one and only Stan Laurel."]},

The characters are well drawn, but even better are the rich colours, meticulously detailed backgrounds and smooth backgrounds. The music is another strength here. It's characterful, lushly orchestrated and is not only dynamic with the action it even enhances it.", "However, Woody is very toned down in personality, not much of his manic persona here and he never gets the chance to be a pest or a hero that he typically is.

The gopher was not a compelling or particularly funny character, a bit annoying somewhat.", "Chemistry between them never properly gels either, and while there are a few amusing moments most of it suffers from a lacklustre foil, both characters portrayed in an unsympathetic way and dull chemistry.

The 1929-1930 batches of Walter Lantz-directed Oswald cartoons were a mixed bag, with some good, some forgettable and not much special and a few mediocre. The 1931 batch was mostly underwhelming, with only 6 out of 18 cartoons being above average or more. The 1932 batch had a few not so good, though the cartoons in question were nothing compared to the worst of the previous 3 years, cartoons, but most were decent to good and some even very good. The 1933 batch is one of the most consistent, with the weakest 'Beau Best' still being decent.", "'William Tell' is another decent cartoon of the 1934 batch, which generally has been consistently of the same standard, nice but unexceptional.", "Can see why some may not be enamoured with it, as 'William Tell', like the later Oswald cartoons, is very much different from the tone of the earlier ones. There is a preference for the more chaotic ones which provided much more fun. Have found that most of the 1934 batch, while still having a good amount to recommend, has bordered on saccharine and cutesy, that's true for some of 'William Tell' too.", "Didn't really see the need for the narration, maybe to fill the gaps in and make the story easier to follow, but to me it didn't add a great deal when the visuals were telling a lot and the storytelling was already clear (coming from somebody who knows the story, through Rossini's opera mainly).", "However, the animation is very good. There is the looser and more elaborate look of many of the previous Lantz era Oswald cartoons, revelling in the rubbery style seen in the Oswald cartoons made around this time.", "Love the music too, which is very characterful and beautifully orchestrated and performed.", "Gags are flawlessly timed and can be very amusing, if not hilarious, while there are touching moments like the portrayal of Tell's dilemma that forms the main crux of the story.

Our setting is a college, and we're told that Helene's character manages a popular clothing store near the campus, and is \"needle-and-threading\" her way through school. In keeping with most collegiate comedies there are no scenes showing students in class or doing any scholastic work whatsoever. Instead, the young folks shop, swim, and dash around all night in the dorms dressed in pajamas. (Ah, dear college days!) Miss Chadwick is a fairly pleasant leading lady but doesn't make much of a lasting impression, while most of the heavy lifting, comedically speaking, is handled by good ol' Jimmy Finlayson, who plays the college's sour-tempered Dean. Things kick into gear when a student devises a \"magic plaster\" that acts as a rejuvenation agent, restoring youth to anyone who comes into contact with it. Perhaps it goes without saying that it's the stuffy Dean who accidentally sits on the plaster and then spends most of the film's running time cavorting like a college boy -- and an unusually silly one, at that. The comic highpoint comes when Finlayson and Helene Chadwick dive into the campus pool and perform a surreal underwater courtship ballet, complete with slow-motion \"chase.\"", "The most unexpected player here is Ted Healy, as the student who concocts the magic plaster. Healy was a vaudeville comic who formed the original Three Stooges, known as Ted Healy & His Stooges in their initial stage incarnation; he went on to work solo as a character actor in lots of '30s features. Wise Guys Prefer Brunettes marked his movie debut and was, if I'm not mistaken, his only appearance in a silent film. I've heard that Healy was a tough, hard-living guy, so his performance in this comedy surprised me: he comes off as downright fey, at one point skipping and dancing like Eddie Cantor. Later, he dresses in highly unconvincing drag and runs around the dorm in a dress. Go figure.", "The first half of this film is fairly entertaining, but inspiration seems to flag well before the finale. Much as I enjoy the unique comic shtick of Jimmy Finlayson I feel his act works best in brief doses, in support of other comedians, and neither Chadwick nor Healy are strong enough personalities (here, anyway) to pick up the slack by themselves. Even so, this short has its moments, and fans of the Roach Studio's silent output will want to give it a look."]},

Although the animation is weak compared to the legendary animes airing around it (Evangelion and Escaflowne, among others) it still features the trademark well-made transformation and fusion sequences which characterized the Yuusha series. The characters start out weak and develop slowly, but eventually we really get a sense of their personalities, if they are extremely stereotypical - En, the punk kid with a heart of gold. Kai, the no-nonsense by-the-books student. Shin, the big guy with a love for the ladies. Yoku, the short nerdy geek. Lastly, Ryu, the free-spirit. With a call of \"Try Dagwon!\" and a flip of their wrist henshin braces, they become the ultimate fighting force: Yuusha Shirei Dagwon! There's plenty of changing and combining robots, and everyone goes home happy in the end. But there's still a charm to this series that's hard to place - a great sense of good vs. evil, and a sentai team concept that works well, even if it takes a while for said team to actually start working as one. While it's not as good as GaoGaiGar (farand away the best of Takara's Yuusha animes) Dagwon is still a fun,engaging, happy storyline that will more than please the young and the young at heart."]},

The first season (episodes 1-26), for the most part, has the basic \"monster of the week\" formula, but it's still generally entertaining, and there's a layer of mystery to Maito's past. This season also introduces most of the villains you see in the show, including Professor Wolfgang, a mad scientist, Catherine Vuitton, a Catwoman-like millionaire thief with a butler named Audrey, and a mafia leader named Hoi Kow Loh and his assistant Shinja. The most interesting villain of the show, however, is Ace no Joe (or Joe the Ace), an ex-military mecha pilot, whose skills are on par with those of Maito. He's a very dark, mysterious character with very interesting developments.

Even when Oito discovers the truth, Hanji is able to turn on the charm and get a freebie from the reluctant geisha, but this act results in both Oito and Hanji being severely beaten by the owners and staff of the brothel. Hanji gets chili peppers rubbed in his eyes, but when it is revealed that Oito is pregnant, the poor woman has a rock dropped on her stomach. Oito is taken to a doctor, Gentatsu (Teruo Yoshida, whose character links all three stories), but, unsurprisingly, she carks it, leaving a beaten and bruised Hanji to regret his actions. This tawdry tale features Ishii's trademark 'tits and torture' formula, but it is artfully shot, with Hanji seducing Oito in a field of patterned cloth being the visual highlight.", "Chapter two starts with a pair of dwarfs breaking into the home of wealthy merchant's daughter Ochise (Mitsuko Aoi). After the little people sexually assault her, she turns the tables on them and gives them a whipping. It transpires that the dwarfs were hired by the woman's besotted servant Chôkichi (Akira Ishihama), his boss only capable of being aroused by men with abnormal bodies. Concerned Chôkichi talks Ochise into visiting Gentatsu, who uses hypnotism to discover the reason for her fetish: he discovers that she was abducted by a disfigured man when she was seventeen and subjected to a series of sexual ordeals (including the obligatory rope bondage). Chôkichi believes he can help Ochise break her habit, and maybe even love him as he loves her, but after she orders the delivery of a big black man (just a tad racist, the suggestion that being black is abnormal), the servant takes desperate measures. I don't want to spoil the ending, but it's wonderfully ironic and perverse.", "The last tale opens in fine deviant style, with a sadistic lord (Asao Koike) unleashing a herd of bulls with flaming horns on a crowd of young female servants dressed in red. As the bulls charge at the women, the lord takes pot-shots at them with his bow and arrow while advising them to strip. One woman, Mitsu (Miki Obana), catches the tyrant's eye: she seems to enjoy the whole experience, and so becomes his favourite concubine. The lord continues his cruelty, coating one of his servants, Okon (Yujie Kagawa), with lead-based gold paint for betraying him with a dog. However, Okon is spared a painful death when she tells the lord that she has a special game to share with him. Again, to give away this twist would spoil the fun, suffice to say that it ends with a graphic (but not very convincing) Caesarian via katana (as performed by Gentatsu, of course), followed by a fiery fate for the lord.", "6/10. Not the best film that I have see by Ishii to date - Boachi Bushido: Code of the Forgotten Eight (1973) and Horrors of Malformed Men (1969) are more enjoyable - but better than Yakuza Law (1969) and Inferno of Torture (also '69 - he was a busy boy that year!), and nowhere near as bad as his sci-fi clunkers Invaders from Space (1965) and Evil Brain from Outer Space (1966)."]},

Zatoichi witnesses how a man got attacked on the road side and speaks to the dying man who tells him his name and asks him to bring a small bag of money to someone called Taichi. Upon arriving in a nearby town, Zatoichi stumbles upon a young boy with that name and realizes he is the dead man's son. He hands the money over to the child and his grandmother but doesn't want to tell them the boy's father is dead. Zatoichi wants to leave town quickly but he is invited by the family of the dead man to stay and attend the roaring drums festival. While in town, Zatoichi witnesses how merchants get brutally extorted by a boss who has started controlling the calm town six months ago. Zatoichi gets caught in the conflict and decides to root for the helpless merchants while the boss hires the same man who killed Taichi's father to challenge Zatoichi to a deadly duel.", "The story described above might sound familiar if you have watched the Zatoichi films released before this one. This is also the film's most obvious flaw because the story is quite predictable and doesn't add anything new to the franchise. Another element I disliked is the fact that some background stories of interesting characters aren't fully explored. We never get to know why Taichi's father really had to die and the reason why the caring prostitute in the town's brand-new brothel ended up like this isn't fully explained either. One element a lot of people praise but that I didn't appreciate was the presence of a blind priest Zatoichi comes across. The old man is quite arrogant and selfish. He asks Zatoichi to buy him food, talks to him while lying down to sleep and doesn't stop lecturing him but can't give any useful advice either. One moment, he tells Zatoichi to not draw his sword in front of Taichi who idolizes the blind samurai and then he approves Zatoichi's decision to defend the exploited merchants. I happened to find the character of the blind priest very annoying, dishonest and pretentious.", "Still, there are enough positive elements about the movie to make it at least an average entry in the epic franchise. First of all, the set of characters is overall quite interesting. Zatoichi is brought to think about his destructive lifestyle, Taichi is torn between admiring and despising the blind samurai, the prostitute is torn between helping her colleagues and helping herself and even the samurai that challenges Zatoichi has to fight his inner demons because he needs to take enormous risks to make money in order to free the person he still loves. The film's atmosphere is also quite intense. It's interesting to see a calm town with honest citizens getting terrorized and infiltrated by criminals, gamblers and prostitutes. Thirdly, the fight sequences are quite great, especially the fight scenes on the bridge where Zatoichi's opponents try to distract the blind samurai with their roaring drums.", "In the end, you will like Zatoichi's Vengeance if you like the franchise. It's an entertaining film even though it doesn't bring anything new to the franchise. If you aren't familiar with the franchise yet, you should rather start watching it in chronological order."]},

He was convinced that the man was The Zodiac and even claims to have received several letters from the killer later on, which were confiscated by the Police.

It might actually be worth a look for patient crime thriller and grindhouse horror enthusiasts, with the understanding that it has little foothold in factuality. Additionally, the backstory of its production makes it something of a novelty, as it was hoped that the film might rouse the interest of the killer, potentially leading to his identification and apprehension.

In one scene the girl is standing outside a cinema. All over the front are pasted 50 or more identical placards of the movie shown just now. Such PLACARD ABUNDANCE was only used for a \"greatfilm\" (yes, it is one single word in Scandinavia). It belongs to the definition of a greatfilm that it is highly admired by both experts and ordinary spectators. The placards belong to \"L'épave\" (The Wreck / Sin and Desire) (1949). They prove that \"L'épave\" was at that time generally perceived as a greatfilm.", "It also had a central place in my own cinematic history. I immigrated to Sweden in 1952 when I was almost 19. My first five years was an odyssey through a dozen of towns, but then I settled in Stockholm.", "I have never changed my mind what were the two best movies I had seen prior to my immigration (listed first), nor about the two best movies I saw during my odyssey:", "\"L'épave\" by Willy Rozier (France, 1949) & \"A Woman Without a Face\" by Gustaf Molander (Sweden, 1947)", "\"Les Enfants du Paradis\" by Marcel Carné (France, 1945) & \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" by Elia Kazan (USA, 1950)", "I saw \"L'épave\" thrice in 1951, but never again until the DVD was released in 2005. ", "(Just a passing remark: \"Le grand bleue\" (The Big Blue) by Luc Besson (1988) is clearly inspired by \"L'épave\". Note in particular the parallel of the last scenes of both movies.) ", "\"L'épave\" could be considered a tragic love romance, but there are complications. The diver loves Perrucha. Did she love him? She would not have given up her virginity if she had not been sure of his serious and permanent feelings. The couple might have had a lasting and happy monogamous relation that would also have satisfied the girl - - - albeit with one question mark. She had a great talent for singing, and she would later have a career. While the couple was together she did long for doing a good artistic job and being admired by audiences.", "The diver had a friend who schemed about the relation. When I was 18 years old I never understood the friend's motives. As far as I could see, the friend had no intention to harm the diver. Then WHY did he actually harm him so seriously? ", "I have eventually learned how some people think. In the friend's eyes Perrucha was not good enough for the diver. So the friend felt that he had both the right and the duty to interfere and do \"what was best\" for the diver.", "The diver had a serious accident at the bottom of the sea. He spent no brief time in a hospital. The friend told Perrucha that the diver had just run away without leaving any address. He also succeeded in stealing and destroying the diver's letters to Perrucha. ", "There is no difference between my private feelings today and my feelings when I was a teenager. May heaven save me from such friends! I and only I want to decide what blunders to do (even if they are indeed blunders). Don't give me any advice! Don't try to arrange things behind my back!", "As things developed we never got a chance to see whether Perrucha could have pursued her singing career even if she had married the diver. When the diver finally came home from the hospital, Perrucha was not there, and the friend told lies about how she had departed.  The diver might never have found her again, if he had not heard her voice in broadcasting. ", "But when he went to her, she had a new lover from a different social class. I had no other attitude in 1951 than today. It is neither surprising nor blameworthy that her love for the diver had ceased. Nor is it blameworthy that she was not prepared to break with her present lover and go back to the diver. Nevertheless, Perrucha had good reason to like, perhaps also to love the diver (although love is not often based on good reason). Nevertheless, I sometimes wonder if their relation could have been resumed if he had had some patience. Unfortunately, his friend had done his best to make both the diver and Perrucha live in the worst of all possible worlds. ", "Admittedly, I am a Romantic. I still think it was tragic that the relation of the couple was destroyed. ", "My reflections have left out many important aspects. It is no wonder that the diver in the end goes down to the sea bottom and cuts the air tube and the rope."]},

The programme was conceived during a time satirical news quiz 'Have I Got News For You' was very much in its golden years, though alas, failed to grab the public nearly as much and only lasted two series. I myself can't understand why, as it was highly entertaining, often side-splittingly funny, and I'd love to see more of it.

Programme segments designed to elicit genuine politician behaviour included 'I Couldn't Disagree More', in which contestants had to disagree with any statement put to them no matter how sensible, 'Yes/No', in which contestants were asked to speak on a given subject without uttering the words 'yes' or 'no', 'State Of The Nation', wherein the studio audience were polled on a particular question and the contestants had to guess their response, and 'The Pager Round', in which contestants had to speak on a given subject, during which they would be continually messaged by their 'spin doctors' with instructions and have to adjust their answers accordingly. The programme format and its incumbents were sufficiently different from HIGNFY to merit its place in the schedules, but presumably, it didn't take off with the lightning speed the BBC was hoping for.

The movie starts on a lighthearted tone as they investigate a case of expensive stolen underwear from a women's college. However, things take a more sinister turn when one of the college girls gets brutally murdered. The three cops soon realize that some college girls are involved in a prostitution ring and get killed when they want to get out or talk to the police. With the help of the mayor's daughter who creates experimental weapons, the quartet confronts the Yakuza boss behind the crimes.", "This movie convinces on many levels. The four female protagonists are quite different, energetic and unique and make for unusual protagonists. The story comes around with quite a few turns and balances brutal scenes with humorous elements in a refreshing way. The film has a perfect length of ninety-two minutes and gets more and more entertaining as it progresses.", "On the negative side, some of the slapstick humour is silly, repetitive and predictable. The fight scenes look fake and should have been shot with a more realistic vibe. The movie was obviously made on a very low budget and it shows as the quality rather recalls Hong Kong action cinema from the early eighties than Japanese gangster movies from the early nineties.", "Still, Eyecatch Junction is entertaining and foreshadows Miike Takashi's unique blend of genres that would define his career. If you are looking for a quirky potpourri of Japanese culture from the early nineties, take your time to find a copy, grab something to drink and to eat and switch your brain off for ninety-two highly entertaining minutes.

Successful we mean in many respects. In the first place it is not too long, being under 700 feet; in the next place every inch of the film seems crowded with action, and in the third place the picture is uniformly good in photographic quality throughout; three features which always make for success in moving picture films. On this little point as to the desirable length of films, we have something to say elsewhere in this week's number. Meanwhile \"Benedict Arnold,\" in our opinion, stands out as one of the successes of the week for the reasons given. Everyone of course is familiar with the story, which it is unnecessary to repeat. But we would like to say that the acting of the performers fully rises to the occasion. Arnold takes his reproof at the hands of Washington as we imagine an officer would. His subsequent conduct in attempting to betray his country is only explicable on grounds of personal hatred. But the producers of this film wisely avoided any examination into subtlety of motive. They deal alone with the facts of history, and history records how Andre, the British spy, is caught by the Americans, stripped and discovered with the goods on him. So he goes to his fate. Arnold, meanwhile escapes, flees to London and dies in a garret, alone and friendless, as a vision of the American flag greets his closing eyes, an emblematic touch which perhaps might have been dispensed with, as the story is so clearly, convincingly and well told. Of course, as we have pointed out, everybody is familiar with this episode in American history, and it therefore needs no explanation. All the same, the Vitagraph Company deserve every praise for the dignified way in which the picture was mounted, dressed, acted and photographed. Short military subjects of this nature are bound to be popular, especially where the canvas is not overcrowded with supernumeraries. Tn this subject there are not too many actors or mobs marching and counter marching, which, however pretty to look at, often obscures the action of the piece. And, as we have said over and over again, the modern moving picture audience wants in its films action, action, action. - The Moving Picture World, November 27, 1909"]},

I saw it a second time at the cinema, and disliked it less - but still wasn't keen. Now, in the dying days of 2002, and quaking with hatred for - and disappointment at - 'Die Another Day', I re-evaluated TWINE for a second time. And I have to say, compared to this year's farce, TWINE is bathed in a golden glow. In terms of character development, plausibility (always tenuous in Bond films, but still), acting, and script, TWINE is far and away and without a shadow of doubt superior to 'Die Another Day'. Above all, this is a Bond film that does occasionally treat its audience like they have brain cells, rather than a ghastly exercise in sci-fi pretensions with MTV production values.", "The opening sequence reveals itself to be one of the very best in the series, taut and exciting, flawlessly directed and perfectly executed. There's nothing else in the film that can quite top it, but some inspired casting helps immeasurably. Sophie Marceau is superb, and it's great to see Robbie Coltrane reprise Valentin Zukovsky, who bags many of the best lines. Judy Dench as 'M' is given a high profile in this entry, which is all to the good as she's clearly the best thing to happen to the Bond films in the Brosnan era. Alas, Desmond Llwelyn makes his final appearance as 'Q' - it would be thus even had he not died the following year - and his exit is well-handled.touching, even. On the downside, Robert Carlyle is not quite convincing as Renard, but it barely matters as Marceau is so firmly in control. Denise Richards isn't as bad as she's been made out to be - indeed, she actually seems smarter and less bland than Halle Berry in DAD.", "Plot and action sequences throughout the film are deftly handled, but there are some areas where TWINE seems a little derivative, cheerfully looting the Bond back catalogue, for example in the Caucasus skiing sequence which fuses together action setpieces from YOLT and OHMSS. There are also moments of alarming silliness more redolent of the 1970s and '80s, such as the scene with John Cleese making his debut as future-'Q' and all scenes with Goldie in as Bullion. And for those of us who aren't fans of Pierce Brosnan, there's plenty to annoy - excessive jaw-clenching, lots of posing, inherent charmlessness. I'm sure he's lovely in real life, mind.", "Generally, though this is a competent entry in the series, and its attempts at depth just about succeed. It is also the most `how'-and-`why'-proof Bond film since the 1960s, a refreshing change from those Bond films that arrogantly command the audience to suspend their beliefs and do all the maths themselves. Quite why it all went wrong three years later is anyone's guess, but I blame 'XXX' and a continuing adoration of 'The Matrix'."]},

He and his crew discover a hidden alien race called The Mysterons, who are curious about Earth and its inhabitants and send signals to meet new life. However Black mistakes a camera for a cannon and orders an attack on the Mysteron complex. This misunderstanding provokes the Mysterons to declare a war of nerves on Earth and throughout the series, they continually make terrorist threats to either kill VIPs such as world leaders, destroy locations such as cities and countries, and in some cases even entire continents. They then attempt to follow through with their threats by using what the Mysterons call \"the ability of Retrometablism\", simply put they can create an exact duplicate of anyone or anything they kill/destroy and it will be under their control. The Mysteron's first act is to take over Captain Black's mind who then becomes the Mysterons top agent on earth. Meanwhile, Spectrum is put in charge of combating the Mysterons, and when one of their other top agents Captin Scarlet is killed and subjected to the Mysteron duplication process, but he was still alive at the time and as a result, his clone was able to shake off the Mysterons' control. This event gives Scarlet the added side effect of being virtually indestructible and impossible to kill, he can survive any wound as he will eventually heal himself to full recovery. This leaves Captain Scarlet to become Spectrums' greatest asset in the fight against the Mysterons. As an agent of Spectrum, Captain Scarlet is under the leadership of Colonel White, who with the help of his right-hand man, Lieutenant Green are ready to mobilize Spectrum forces at a moment's notice from the airborne aircraft carrier called Cloudbase stationed high above the clouds. These include its fighter squadron, The Angels (5 beautiful yet deadly and skilled female combat pilots) piloting their Angel Interceptors as well as a fleet of other Spectrum Vehicles such as the Spectrum Pursuit Vehicles (SPV), the Spectrum Saloon Cars (SSC), the Spectrum Passenger Jets (SPJ) and the Spectrum Helicopters among the many others. So when a Mysteron threat is announced Captain Scarlet together with his partner, Captain Blue as well as the other Spectrum Captain's seen in the series Captain Ocher, Captain Magenta, and Captain Gray, must be constantly vigilant to fight against the deadly alien menace of the Mysterons from Mars."]},

I wasn't expecting too much but was pleasantly surprised by the original story this film tells. Treat Williams plays a prefab housing engineer who travels to Saudi Arabia in the late 70's to cinch a multi-million dollar deal. But when he arrives he discovers that what he bargained for wasn't actually much of a bargain. His original deal with the Saudi government collapses and he is forced to rely on the good graces of his unreliable but charismatic Arab middle man. As the title implies things don't get much better and Williams and he must try to escape before he ends up under a dune in the desert! If you look at the cover of this video you'd think it was just another action movie. It isn't it, in fact its a very scary and true story of cultural clash and a surprisingly balanced look at the dubious justice system of Saudi courts. Check it out if your a fan of Treat Williams or if you appreciate a reality based story. I'd also recommend \"Doomsday Gun\" which deals in similar stuff as this."]},

The short tells the story of Mark Carleton (Donald Douglas), a worker for the USGA who travels across the world trying to find wheat that farmers can grow no matter about the drought situation. He finally finds such a wheat in Russia but after the U.S. farmers plant it they are shocked to see that it's too rough to turn into flour. Then, another disaster hits the farmers but this is when Carleton's wheat might come in handy. If you're not familiar with the Passing Parade series then it's best described as a MGM series that tried to remind people of important people of the past who had been forgotten over time. I'm not sure how many people will remember Carleton today but this is a pretty incredible little story and future Oscar-winner Fred Zinnemann does a marvelous job getting it to the screen. In 9-minutes this short contains more drama than most features as the director really builds up the human drama of the story and he really nails the emotions that Carleton had to go through as there were several up and down moments in his life. As usual, Nesbitt's narration strikes the right cord and it too helps add to the drama of the story. Zinnemann directed dozens of shorts before turning to features and it's easy to see the talent that's on display here."]},

Indeed, it was only by chance that I came across it on Youtube a couple of years ago. But those who remember it still rave about it even now and no wonder. Quite frankly it is one of the best children's drama series ever made, yet it has never been repeated since it's broadcast in 1993. It doesn't even get a mention in the book \"The Hill and Beyond: Children's Television Drama - An Encyclopedia!\"", "Adapted from the 1989 novel by Anne Fine, it begins with pupil Helly Pearson (Alexandra Milman) running distraught from the classroom and her teacher asking Kitty Killin (Honeysuckle Weeks) to go after her. Discovering that Helly is upset about her mother's relationship with a new man, Kitty relays her own experiences of when her divorced mother Rosie (Lesley Manville) started dating a older man called Gerald (Alun Armstrong) - a man Kitty dubs Goggle Eyes, due to his habit of oogling her mother. Kitty takes a immediate dislike to Gerald and decides upon a campaign to get rid of him by any means, fair or (usually) foul. After imagining various ways to dispose of Gerald (toxic waste, dynamite, machine gunned via the TV, and stuffed on a bonfire just a few from Kitty's imagination) she sets more realistic plans into action, even at one point bribing her young sister Jude (Victoria Shalet) in her campaign, though Jude is happily accepting of Gerald.", "Like the novel, the story is told mainly via flashback, which is remarkable in itself for a children's drama. Mother Rosie is an environmentalist and animal activist who has raised her daughters in much the same way, so when she picks up with conservative, fussy, middle aged Gerald her daughter Kitty cannot believe it. She takes against him due to his politics, his age, and his pinickety behaviour, such as his habit of turning off the lights to preserve energy - the irony being that they share much of the same environmental concerns without realizing it. But Kitty has already set against him before they meet, due to the fact that her regular habits with her mother are disrupted, such as their regular meeting at a restaurant to discuss their campaign against animal testing - another subject that she clashes with Gerald about.", "But what I love about this series is that all four characters have their points and their flaws, and the clash of beliefs make this series really stand out. Honeysuckle Weeks is astonishing in her debut role as Kitty, especially as her character is not an easy one to like at times. She is often selfish, stubborn and intolerant of other people's views, but as the drama progresses we see that is also reflective of her mother Rosie. But although Gerald is far more measured and articulate in his views he also has his flaws, such as stating out to Kitty the scientific advances in animal experiments without considering alternatives to this. And there are rare moments when you can understand Kitty's irritation of Gerald, such as deciding what programmes they can watch before he has even moved himself in yet. Even sweet Jude has her faults, such as avoiding doing any household chores because she is the youngest.", "But it is mother Rosie's character that is the catalysis for the turn of events in the story. Like Kitty she is stubborn with a set form of principles and beliefs and a intolerance to anyone or anything that challenges it. When Gerald accompanies the family on a environmental protest at some marshland for a proposed building of a leisure centre, he is shocked when she tells Jude off for \"whining\" after a few hours blockading the area. When he tells Rosie she is only little and probably cold she lashes out that she should tolerate it for the good of the cause, leading him to remark on her bossiness and inconsideration for other people. Like many things in this drama, there is a measured argument on the development on the marshland site, with Rosie despairing of a part of greenland countryside being concreted over, while Gerald argues that it is a deprived area that could benefit from the lesiure centre, as well as the jobs it would provide to locals in the area (this was 1992/93 recession era, remember). But Rosie's inconsideration for others is apparent when she damages one of the building notices after being riled by one of the workmen, leading to her being arrested and carted off by the police. While she glorifies in being arrested, she never gives one thought to what will happen to her daughters.", "It is here that Gerald comes to the fore, taking them home and looking after them, cooking for them and making sure everything is as normal as possible while Rosie is in custody. Kitty begins to see Gerald in a new light, and these scenes are touching as she finally begins to thaw towards him. However, the twist in this tale is that it isn't Kitty that threatens this new happy arrangement but Rosie, who arrives home on bail at night and is stunned that Gerald has sent the kids to bed, and even more stunned by his admonishment of her irresponsible behaviour as a parent. The resulting argument sees Gerald depart, but while Kitty has finally got her wish, she now desperately wants him to stay. There is some irony in this, but can anything be done to put things right?", "Weeks' performance as mentioned is superb in her debut. The fact that Weeks was in the middle of her own parents' divorce when filming this must of been particularly conflicting for her, but is so naturalistic in what is a lead role. But she is matched by her co stars, with Alun Armstrong giving a intelligent and likeable performance as the patient, articulate, 'boring' Gerald, while Lesley Manville, despite a somewhat unsympathetic character at times, is never less than thoroughly convincing as the girls mother Rosie. But the biggest revelation is Victoria Shalet, who gives an astonishingly performance as young Jude, who is happy to accept Gerald into her family as all she wants is some stability in her life. Apparently director Carol Wiseman was so impressed by her that she kept her in mind for her next project, which turned out to be The Queen's Nose. And she certainly impresses in this, sometimes just by her facial reactions (the look she gives Honeysuckle Weeks in episode 3 when asked to do the washing up is priceless). Alexandra Milman (who seemed to be in everything in the 1990's) also shines in the smaller (but important) role of Helly, whose own situation is the trigger for the story.", "It has to be said that despite this being a children's series, there are some remarkably risque and fruity dialogue in this that somehow avoided the censor. When Jude asks Gerald if she can do the washing up tomorrow, he replies \"Only sluts and drunks leave things until tomorrow,\" while Weeks accuses her mother of looking like a hooker when she dresses up for Gerald the first time he arrives, leading to Jude to ask \"What's a hooker?\" Not to mention the comments by the workmen on the lie down protest at the development site, with one quipping \"That's how I like to see my women - flat on their back.\" How did that get past censors? There's also a somewhat saucy rhyme that Gerald relays to Jude to use as a school project for her teacher, while in one scene early in episode 4 when Kitty and Helly try to persuade a group of schoolgirls to vacate their regular meeting place to continue their story, they are told in no uncertain terms to \"piss off!\" However, nothing can detract from what is a superb children's drama - not even the twittering biology teacher in ep 3 that is the one false note in this series. The characters feel real, the dialogue is natural and the story is compelling from beginning to end. It is astonishing that it has never been repeated since it's broadcast, but thankfully it is available to see on Youtube. If you want to see how good children's drama used to be, you'll find few better ones to start with than Goggle Eyes."]},

As with most bios, I'm sure many liberties are taken with the stories but I really don't mind that because of how well told they are here. One big difference in this entry is that the actors get to speak their own dialogue. Most of the times you had Nesbitt's narration being the only thing you heard but that's cut down this time out and we get to see some of the acting. Wills, a character actor, does a very good job here and really captures ones heart with his uneducated, down to earth performance. The supporting players are very good as well and we get Nesbitt doing a good job on the narration he does do. The story itself is one I hadn't heard about before so it was certainly educational and kept me entertained."]},

In the 1890's a man writes to a small town and asks that a four bedroom house be built, and remits the detailed specifications and the funds. After the house is complete he moves into it alone. He never talks to anyone nor does he let anyone inside. He also orders clothes for a woman, a female child, and a male child, yet there is nobody living in his house but himself. Naturally the townspeople are very suspicious of this fellow. One night, passers by see the doctor's carriage pull up to the man's house. Later, the horse pulling the doctor's carriage goes back to the doctor's house by habit - without the doctor. The townspeople storm the house just sure that the odd stranger has murdered the doctor. What do they find inside? Watch and find out.", "Back to why there was a disclaimer on the short - my own suppositions. The short Nesbitt made before this was about a British woman whom Nesbitt actually called by name - Catherine Starr. When her fiancée is killed in battle in 1901 she develops a fear of people as a result of the shock that causes her to not leave her house for almost 40 years. She only does so when Germany's bombs force her out. I wondered how the British - at the time our allies and in the fight of their lives - would feel about one of their own being portrayed as a lifelong coward only set in motion by extreme events, and perhaps they didn't like it so much and complained to MGM. If the story turned out to be fabricated, it might well have caused such disclaimers on future shorts that weren't about actual historical figures. I can't find anything on any scandal involving the truthfulness of John Nesbitt, so I guess the sudden disclaimer will remain a mystery."]},

Like the one previously criticised, much of the staging, which includes the costuming, must be taken on trust, but it would seem that the work has been well done. The priestly garb, the soldiers and the others seem to be costumed in accordance with the accepted interpretation of modern scholars. In the acting, Ada, Jephthah's daughter, the central figure of this tragedy, does her work as well as is possible. Jephthah is admirably acted, these two figures rising to true tragedy in their interpretation of their parts. The others are merely accessories, and their work calls for no extended review. The film is toned brown, excepting the sacrificial altar just before the fire is lighted, which is a rather heavy blue, and after the fire is lighted it is a brilliant red, like the glow of a fire. Both changes heighten the effect and improve the picture. As a whole this effort is to be warmly commended.

It is the old familiar story of the judgment between the two claimants of the live child. The entire story is tense with dramatic interest, and, in the main, the actors have maintained this interest throughout the piece. The principal character, the real mother of the live child, is acted with fidelity and a comprehension of what a mother would do under such circumstances. Every motion, every facial expression is in accord with the character and deserves the highest praise. The other characters are good, but inasmuch as they are accessories, even Solomon himself being included in this description, they do not require separate criticism. To say that they perform their parts with sufficient fidelity to the story to make it clear expresses their part in the drama. The staging, which includes the costuming and the arrangement of palaces and accessories, is apparently in accord with the accepted understanding of what was used at that time. The entire picture is toned brown, which, in places, degenerates into plain gloom. This does not, however, mar the picture. On the contrary it supplies an element of mystery which adds to its attractiveness and increases the artistic effect. Brown lends itself admirably to this picture, but it would scarcely be advisable in others where a stronger light is required. The lighting is reasonably soft and even and shows evidence of careful study to secure the most artistic and pleasing effects. It is a pity that the picture cannot run longer. One day is inadequate for such an excellent piece of work. - The Moving Picture World, May 29, 1909"]},

The plot and the setting is totally different but the feeling you got is similar.The movie is seen from the perspective of two kids in four somewhat interrelated scenes.In the first part we see a school environment in winter in which the kids are hailing out the national pledge in the cold school garden.We see the the family's 11 year old daughter as a pupil \"facing with her feeling of shame and some merciless clues of life \" in that scene this is obvious but what is more catching is that the teacher wants the students to read some part from a text-book about community-specifically the sense of belonging to a community-the need to belong to some social unit.The kids just read the passage without making sense of what is written there.You see Turkey revolutionized its alphabet from Arabic to Roman letters but basically there's still a \"maktap literacy\" going on in these traditional distant state schools.The kids do probably know something about human beings' social needs but they don't necessarily pay attention to the passage they're studying in theory. The second part is in spring. We see the girl with her 4 year younger brother, and their wandering towards the corn field where their family are waiting for them.They just drop in a graveyard to eat some plums.There is something inter-cultural here too.When her brother tries to reach the plums on the branch his sister says \"Hey you're stomping at the grave\" The adults in Anatolia scare their kids with a warning in such situations \"Hey the dead will inhale you\" This innocent tell-off results from the respect for the dead actually.This part has the least number of dialogs actually.While the siblings are discovering mysteries of nature they barely talk and the director turns his camera into nature.Even at one point he focuses on the eyes of a helpless donkey badgered by flies.In the third part the brother and sister arrive at the corn filed where the some sort of a bonfire is lit and the grandmother's are roasting maize cobs.The grandfather tells his experiences during the First World War, how he was taken prisoner by the British and sent to India, how he endured years of starvation. This is the nature of the old Anatolian man.Whenever they see a youngster they just think that they live in a tacky world so they tell how they suffered.While the grand-dad is such a spiritually mature man in consequence of his early sufferings the father of the kids is the only educated man in the family.He sort of had difficulties to educate himself he even taught himself foreign languages.But even though he is strong in analytical thought he has barely spiritual weltanschauung.He is a great admirer of Alexander and he tells about every war Alexander did wage.And then there is this cousin Saffet who is gritty nihilist.\"You worked all your life so what?\" You just came back to the point where you started?\"Even though he is coarse and ironic he is the most realistic one actually.The fourth part takes place at home.It ends with a placid river scene actually. As for the technical details.The movie is openly monochrome.The DVD details say the director wanted something simple so he used simple cameras and most of the cast are either his relatives or his acquaintances actually. At some points I thought there could have been more dialogs.Because while the second part has barely a flowing dialog the third part is inundated with dialogs.(The grandfather's war experiences and the father's Alexander admiration).Plus Nuri Bilge Ceylan's camera technique focusing on nature looks like Elem Klimov's strategy in Idi i smotri(Come and See)(1985).I had felt bored because of this lack of dialogs and excessiveness of such camera angles in Come and See. But since Kasaba is not that long it's better but if it were longer it would be definitely boring.All in all it was a good step for me to know Nuri Bilge Ceylan's art."]},

Its model in the form and the content was the violent and bloody universe of Quentin Tarantino. One year later, hiring the same crew, he did it again with \"les Kidnappeurs\", obviously an endeavor to produce a new little worked up whodunit in the same vein as its predecessor. Alas, it's a let-down which isn't up to scratch with \"le Ciel est à Nous\" and has virtually nothing commendable.", "There have been harsh words about Guit's effort and rightly so. It fails to be exciting albeit the onset starts under auspicious skies. As a matter of fact, the whole interest of the film remains confined in the outset with this astute idea: how Ulysse reveals to his accomplices how it is possible to simply succeed the burglary without danger and to pocket the loot. But as the average viewer can guess, it's too good to be true since in reality, the operation will go awry and the loot will be rubbish. It's the only watchable part of the flick and the job must be done under Freddy's orders.", "Alas, after the first meeting of the gang with him, it's downhill and it seems that Guit has left the building. The rest of the film consists of complex filler and its desultory character is revealed in all its splendor. Various inexplicable twists, complications and muddle clutter a screenplay written besides in a snap manner without altering and more serious without any attempt to clarify it. The director doesn't bother for his job and shelved a crucial premise of the cinema: a film is a sort of communicative link between its author and the viewer. But here, by delivering a story which is hard to decipher, Guit shows no respect for the audience.", "As he botches his job with his couldn't-care-less directing, it doesn't help his actors who do what they can to save the film from wreckage although it is doomed to failure. Too bad for young interprets like Elodie Bouchez or Melvil Poupaud who made the mistake to get themselves embroiled in this dud. Isaac Sharry makes his part count early in the story but then it becomes uninteresting. Romain Duris stands out as the lousy baddie with an IQ close to zero but one prefers him when he teams up with Cedric Klapisch. It even seems that the cast, by moments prefers to enjoy sunny landscapes.", "Loose: it's the most suitable adjective to qualify Guit's piece of work who neglected to include stringent in his mind when he wrote the film. A hash of money as well as a waste of film both for the actors and the audience. Take \"le Ciel est à Nous\" instead.", "NB: Elie Kakou dies at the end of the film, a sinister omen when one knows that he died of a cancer the following year in 1999..."]},

In strange way, this film reminds me of trainspotting, and not just in the ample drugs, sex, and violence. We watch the downfall of a sickly and comically-inept family through the eyes of the emotionally numb Kinichi. Kinichi is simply brilliant. He wanders through this dangerous world in a heroin daze, making each life-or-death decision casually. Despite the many reprehensible actions we see him commit, he is still entirely likable. Yoko is also a fantastic character, although we're never quite sure why she came along for the ride. The comedy runs dark, drawing from the surreality of the otherwise grim situations. The yakuza boss in his hospital gown, high as a kite, firing his gun wildly on the hospital roof; the omnipresent cigarette in Kinichi's mouth; the negotiation of his survival from a kiddie pool in a garage. The cinematography is fantastic -- many very creative uses of light and dark, and the grit of Osaka's nether regions is beautifully captured. The mood is of wandering home, drunk, late at night, without any idea of what direction you should be going, or if there is even a home waiting for you."]},

She's shown topless at every possible opportunity, with the giant tattoos providing an excuse to do so. It would have been nice had the film expanded her character a little more and made her the final battle, because you see, the lone wolf (Tomisaburo Wakayama) has been tasked with hunting her down. The film has its moments, including all sorts of dismemberment, a man with an improbable ability to mold his face into the shape of another's asked to commit hara-kiri for someone else, and a battle scene with guys who were camouflaged as statues (probably the film's best). The baby is now three years old and capable of wielding the cart's hidden machine guns, which comes in handy, as you'd hate to bring just a sword to a gun fight. The lone wolf has some sense of honor but is still just a mercenary, and moreover, one who isn't invulnerable, which makes him an interesting character, and Wakayama plays the part reasonably well.

His winning over the naysayers sexually is hampered by his inability to achieve an erection -in a \"real\" porn movie he would be replaced, but these quickies were evidently made on an \"all footage is usable\" 1 to 1 shooting ratio.

Looking to spice up his repertoire, he contacts local music producer Ralph Tinkle (Lee LeMay) searching for an innovative erotic act. Thankfully, Tinkle knows just the people, calling on a young couple looking to make it in the music biz. As luck would have it, the lady of the pair is already a stripper at Ruby's, and she and her boyfriend are able to take over the headlining gig from her bored coworker, who spices up her situation by joining Ralph's associate Dick Mustard (Jesse Adams) making porn films.", "Writing this out, it all sounds like haphazard nonsense, yet the film weirdly makes it work. Somehow, the contrived web of associations (the owner of a failing strip club is somehow landlord to a semi-successful music producer?) serves to make what little action takes place seem more meaningful, and there's a pleasantly consumable quality to the low-stakes problem-solving. No sooner is a want identified (stripper is bored, strip club is losing money, young couple wants to make it in the music industry) then the film offers a solution (stripper becomes a porn star, club starts hosting sexual music acts, the couple can perform in them). If porn is about wish fulfillment, THE LIVE SHOW takes it to its logical conclusion - if only every real-life problem were solved as easy as here!", "It helps that all the sex scenes employ a good mix of stolen music and well-selected library tracks, which helps this kind of filler go down smoothly. The film also has a healthy sense of humor, and is packed with weird industry in-jokes like the character of porn producer Dick Mustard (a reference to prolific XXX director Richard Mailer, known as Mr. Mustard). The actor even wears a shirt from Mailer's real production company (along with one for Lasse Braun's SENSATIONS in another scene!). Most of the cast isn't too well known, though many have a fair number of credits - sort of a who's-who of porn's character actors, if you will. Blair Harris pops up with a beard (unusual for him) as Bob the boyfriend, and pulls both the look and the role off with aplomb. He must earn some kind of award for Sensitive Porno Boyfriend, as he welcomes his girl home with a cuddle and a cold beer! Forget artistic ambition - if more porn were just this relaxed and congenial, it would still be far more pleasant to watch!"]},

Esai Morales has a pointless scene as a gay film director who idolizes Ronny. Esai should have stuck around to screen this film, since they spell his first name \"Essai\" in the opening credits. Loggia and Hoskins spend the entire film yelling the F word at each other. Neither is likable. Director Marois could not frame a decent shot to save his life. I have seen better production values from the local university's broadcasting department's news show on public access. Watch for a scene where Mann gets out of a taxi, and a boom microphone's reflection is clearly visible in the cab's roof. Marois also cowrote the screenplay, perhaps trying to put a satirical screwball spin on the porn world. Too bad no one takes the porn world seriously enough to want to see it skewered by some second rate film maker who hasn't an original thought to put on the screen. Look for porn star Ron Jeremy as a cop, proving once again that all his talent is contained below his waist. \"American Virgin\" is loud, dumb, and unfunny. Suvari was one of the best things about \"American Pie,\" but here she looks embarrassed. She should be."]},

But he quickly decides to beat them at their own strategy by fleeting northward to the snow-covered region of northern Japan during the winter season where the Tsuchigumo will be at a disadvantage since they cannot appear to burrow through ice and snow.", "After Itto defeats Hyouei and kills the three supernatural Tsuchigumo, the story culminates in a final battle between Itto and the combined clan groups under Retsudo on a snow-capped mountain in northern Japan, in which the baby cart becomes a sled. Retsudo, now leading an army of Shogun warriors, around 1,000 strong, confront Itto on a mountain ridge. Once again, (as in the third film 'Lone Wolf and Cub: Baby Cart to Hades') Itto transforms the baby cart to a weapon with his machine gun, spears, daggers and swords. In a final combat, Itto defeats the entire army, shooting, stabbing, slashing, dismembering and beheading the entire army.

Joke of this awful film is that at the end one lady declares: \"You didn't really save our marriage, but you made us happy!\", CT's feel-good hedonistic message. Running gag is that the good doc is a lecher, but fortunately all of Tobalina's love-making to his femme patients (he insists on personally \"servicing\" each and every one of them) is omitted.", "What's left is tedious and repetitive white-coater action (Tobalina actually wears a white coat with stethoscope dangling around his neck) supervised by Brennan and a tall, unattractive actress as a fellow therapist. Main actors are the couples Tom Byron & Danielle plus less familiar (non-stars) David Derek and Blair Castle/Brooke Fields, former assigned to Colleen while Ms. Unnamed tends to David and Lisa (perhaps our auteur's in-joke reference to the brilliant Frank & Eleanor Perry classic film, an art-house hit in the early '60s). The couples unite with their handlers for a 6 on a bed orgy to climax the lengthy first section of the film.", "That leaves half an hour for an uninterrupted orgy to end the show, in which a dozen players hump non-stop on the floor, 7 of them women, with a well-photographed circular daisy chain for the femmes. This orgy is presaged at the beginning of the DVD by highlights, which play better than the tedium that follows.", "So we get to see redhead Colleen, better loved in her earlier soft-core incarnation as Sharon Kelly, show us the wonders of the Inca Knot and other legendary gimmicks preciously taught to us fans by Sharon Thorpe. In the latter years of his career Tobalina didn't put much effort into his films, so it's not surprising he would merely repeat himself here, especially since young archivist/distributors with no appreciation of history or quality had not yet come along to unearth crap like his \"Carnal Haven\", safely gathering dust at the time in his vaults. He did remain wedded to shooting in 35mm till the bitter end, so the footage is watchable if worthless, as it takes more than format (listen carefully, you wet-behind-the-ears porno rescuers of obscure cinema) to make a movie WORTH watching."]},

Seems the pickup is part of a drug deal arranged by Marc (Marc Brock, best known as Dracula from the loopy Carol Conners vehicle THE BRIDE'S INITIATION), but Jack has grabbed the wrong girl! This lady is French, speaks with a silly accident, and seems confused why all these Americans are carting her around.

It doesn't make a ton of sense and the sex is pretty poorly photographed (much looking like insert shots added later), but at least it's a coherent narrative with a beginning, middle, and end (with denouement provided - as usual - by a dumb last-minute twist that's at least darker than most films of this ilk). However, judged by the standards of a 35mm production, it's wanting. Despite the early feint toward exteriors and location shooting, the film is thereafter confined entirely to the hotel, and it slowly stagnates given how little is going on. None of the characters are particularly memorable, though Jack Colt's well-toned body is at least a welcome counterpart to the female flesh, so often paired with some of the ugliest male bodies on Earth in smut like this. Extremely hard-to-find and not at all worth the effort, MARY JANE is one more regional production that slipped through the cracks - spiced up with a bit of hardcore, though mostly just dragging on interminably. A real bummer of a caper flick, this one's for completists only."]},

In her debut feature, it's not difficult to see why - she has a very natural appeal that shines through the garish '80s styling and even more garish video format.", "The setting is a vacation home with Herschel Savage, fiancee Lois Ayres, a friend (Francois Papillon, physically stunning as ever and thankfully given minimal dialogue) and his new girlfriend (Sade), and a dull Trivial Pursuit-playing friend (Johnny Nineteen - not named so for either age or appendage) and his partner Rose Marie. Savage and Ayres are your usual upwardly mobile horrors, as the opening has her wincing at the idea of being around his more common relatives and speculates that Papillon is only dating Sade to try to seem hip. Savage, meanwhile, does an Indian voice and nearly says something else racist until he remembers Sade is in the room - she then says it for him.", "Strong and Luis de Jesus (a fitting pairing as she was at the start of her career while he was near the end of his) arrive, the rebellious daughter of Santa and a New Orleans madam, and a raunchy elf kicked out of the North Pole. At this point I wondered if they were going to teach the cynical ensemble the meaning of goodness, or Christmas, including some sort of rainbow coalition sexual connection between Savage and Sade. That never happens (Sade is just limited to one scene with Papillon - a waste), and instead you get a more generic sex romp.", "Some ideas are fun, like a fireside encounter with Savage and Ayres where the elf has a stream of filth talk and Ayres assumes a confused Savage is giving her instructions but let down by lackluster execution as well as the stretching of sex scenes that mar so many adult films. There's an extended scene which will probably have a unique appeal to some viewers, where de Jesus chases Rose Marie around before finally convincing her to let him use her present on her (a sex toy), leading to much more. Ayres, meanwhile, ends up in Nineteen's room while going back to Savage, and Marie is...busy elsewhere, leading them to hook up as she realizes he's not so dull after all. I would say this is the best scene in the film, with Ayres and Nineteen having some nice heat together. Strong and Savage, who paired up early in the film then disappeared, walk in on them and decided to share the bed, but beyond some fun banter between Savage and Nineteen (I know some people can't stand that type of stuff in a sex scene but it works for me here), there's no real interaction. There's one long portion where Nineteen and Ayres are just on the bed, not shown at all, while Savage and Strong go at it. It reminds you of just stale the presentation was compared to the potential.", "Strong gets her final desire by briefly trysting with Papillon on the couch before leaving for Hollywood, and, presumably, a more interesting life than what we got a glimpse of here.", "I do have to point out the soundtrack going for a Christmas carol theme in her sexual encounters, played on a loop, along with another track that has a voice going \"whoo!\" for your amusement."]},

Brenda Basse is a Black actress who plays a lesbian who seduces McBain; she is clearly identified in the trailer for Chuck Vincent's comedy BANG BANG.", "Opening credits cause much confusion by stating: \"Introducing Brenda Basse and Eric Edwards\". Now in mainstream films an \"introducing\" card is often accorded an actor who has previously had only minor roles, but Eric Edwards had made dozens of films predating this one, even if the 1977 date is incorrect. He certainly looks older here than in his familiar early roles in such films as Roberta Findlay's Angel Number 9 or Chuck Vincent's Mrs. Barrington, as well as famous assignments for Joe Sarno. Why Basse merited this special credit is odd, unless it was a slow con to set a trap (Something Weird hack take note) for would-be fake \"film historians\" of our decadent age, who extrapolate and jump to false conclusions in an effort at self-promotion, since one would assume from the skimpy credits that she, not McBain, had the lead role.", "Plot is set in motion when Miss Kent receives a phone call from her late uncle's attorney, informing her that if she carries on the old guy's sex survey, and comes up with results validating his research, she will come into a $2 million inheritance. Voice on the phone is very familiar, being that of ubiquitous porn star Eric Edwards.", "That's enough plot for nearly an entire porn film, though a final reel twist pulls a switcheroo. Until then McBain as Janice Kent interviews various folks and in the manner of Playboy Magazine's popular cartoon character Little Annie Fanny, has sex with them in wide-eyed fashion without even a modicum of coaxing necessary.", "Two of the interviewees are black, making for effective mixed combo scenes with John Lawrence and the aforementioned Brenda Bassie, latter strapping on a dildo for good measure. Herschel Savage, who is probably already a member of the \"1,000 movie roles\" club (especially if you include his short loop appearances), already shows potential early in his career as a nonchalant guy, who identifies his line of work as \"porn actor and collecting unemployment\" (!), that McBain picks up lolling around on the stairs of a brownstone, in a rare exterior shot that brands this film as \"Made in NYC\".", "McBain's beauty, her ease with dialog (she recites her pre-set list of interview questions with nary a flub) and overall classiness make the movie watchable. Though lensed by the talented C. Davis Smith, it is a cheapie, with a crummy musical track that emphasizes banjo music for no reason. I will not discuss the stupid final reel since to do so is an instant spoiler, but as usual this truncated print ends abruptly before the inevitable Eric Edwards' money shot can be shown."]},

She has severe autism and generally answers every question with the word \"no\". One senses, however, that locked inside her being is a woman as bright as she is beautiful. Her older brother, Buck (Aaron Eckhart) has only visited her on rare occasions, as he was going through college and starting his career in advertising. Word comes, however, that the nursing home is closing and that Buck will have to make new arrangements for Molly. Very apprehensive, Buck brings Molly back to his Venice, California apartment, where the chaos soon begins. When a daycare situation goes sour, Buck has to bring Molly to work, where her erratic behavior soon causes the firm to lose a major account. Buck is promptly fired, causing resentment between the siblings. However, a clinic worker, Sam (Thomas Jane) has been a friend to Molly for years and he encourages Buck to be patient and caring. Also, a doctor at the clinic (Jill Hennessey) convinces Buck to let them try a new surgical technique on Molly, one that will allow her to lead a more normal life. Amazingly, after the procedure, Molly does become more verbal and starts to catch up on some of life's moments that have eluded her. But, can it last? This is a very nice film about an important topic, autism. However, instead of focusing on children, this one shines a light on the experiences of an adult with the condition. As such, Shue is wonderful as the brave and bright Molly while Eckhart is equally fine as her confused but goodhearted brother. One must also congratulate Hennessey and especially Jane for giving great turns as well. The setting in Venice is beautiful and the other cinema niceties, such as costumes and photography, are more than adequate. The script is both lightly humorous and tear generating, at the same time, and gives the audience a good look at the autistic individual, trapped inside his or her own body. Even so, one suspects that the film, made in 1999, might be a bit dated as to current discoveries and treatments. But, that matters little, indeed, to the overall enjoyment of the flick. If you are a fan of sweet, thought-provoking stories, told with care and humor, you should make time for Molly. Good golly, you will be entertained and enlightened at the same wonderful time."]},

Karine, played by Mia Slavenska, whose unfortunate case of chronic bitch face doesn't inhibit her acting, surprisingly acts like an adult in the well-written screenplay, despite the horror she has inflicted upon her. Not everyone does act like an adult in real life, but this seems to be grossly over represented in films, so here is a breath of fresh air, and with reasoning behind it. Ballet provides a strict discipline for becoming graceful, which overflows into interpersonal relations. Children will continue to do evil things they don't understand the full consequences of, but they can be made to understand and become a better adult with proper treatment.

The thing is the rest of the video doesn't match this great start. All is not lost however. The best scenes are hot enough to make up for the weaker ones. Each job is given a setup (sometimes with dialog) intro.", "\"Glades Ranger\" is first and fantastic. She (Christine Sheffner) patrols the waters on a airboat before hanging out nude in front of a ranger station in the woods. This part is shot in sepia unfortunately and her male coworker stares at her during most of it (can't say I blame him though). However it provides good closeups including a risqué view of her kitty from behind and I gotta say she has one of the best sets of enhanced boobs I've ever seen. At night with a campfire, Christine rubs her body in all the right ways (5.5 mins).", "\"Jet Fighter\" begins as the pilot (Daphnee Duplaix) exits her aircraft and gets chewed out by her superior. This leads to a strip from a jumpsuit that provides some nice shots sometimes in closeup. Again the guy watches her, but she gets revenge by shoving him around (4.5 mins). \"Lifeguard\" has her (Nina) pose solo in a red one piece 'Baywatch' bikini intercut with some boy/girl and in the lifeguard tower as pictures gets taken of her. Nina looks great and it's a good scene, but a bit too much jumping around for my taste (4 mins).", "\"Corporate Boss\" has the lady in charge (Maritza) dismiss all the employees from her office except one dude. She strips for him and there's some light boy/girl in the office chair or on the desk in between solo posing (5 mins). \"S. W. A. T.\" has this lady cop (Cory Oltz) run a target practice, fire a few different types of guns and then strip in front of a white wall. Hands down the weakest scene (4.5 mins).", "\"Fantasy Air\" has a wealthy couple board their private jet and start to make out. Wife (Michelle) gets topless and there's nice shots of her butt in thong panties. The flight attendant (Jessica Garvin) strips down, bending into multiple positions solo or with them. Jessica has a seductive look and gives the best actual uniform strip looking quite into it (5 mins).", "\"FireGirls\" follows blonde firefighters (Rachael, Nicollette) as they strip, spray each other and pose near the vintage truck & some dalmatians. It's a decent scene (4.5 mins). \"1 on 1\" is a silly b-ball segment where one of the ladies (Samantha) lusts after her two all-star teammates (Michelle Adams, Bonnie Jean Davis). There's some shots of Sam striping on the court, but the views pick up when they hit the locker room. Every itch of Sam's body gets explored as she strips as the two teammates are naked in the shower (5.5 mins).", "\"Nurse Dreams\" finds the two (Victoria Knight, Dawn McFall) taking care of a male patient and stripping bedside. A good shot or two, but not very strong (3.5 mins). \"Movie Usher\" is brought down by focusing on visual effects, story & dialog. She (Joy Behrman) strips from her uniform as the B&W movie's onscreen male takes notice of her. If it would have stayed focus on Joy in the theater more this scene would have been better (7 mins).", "I was really looking forward to this Playboy title. Although some scenes felt average - nurses, boss - only one was dismal - cop. Still 'Girls in Uniform' delivers on it's theme pretty well. The end credits even feature footage not seen earlier which is a nice bonus."]},

Anyway, she was worthy of the title because she is really a stunning, natural babe. She remains the only playmate I look for as my preference goes clearly to Penthouse magazine. As Pepsi/Coca, Microsoft/Apple, Star Wars/Star Trek, Marvel/DC, the competition is clear cut and the teasing, not explicit nature of Playboy just bores me. This magazine seems to be lost in its own fantasy (50s student) with look alike babes month after month. They want to offer syrupy sensuality but it's not very liberating and exciting.", "This video is just like that. You got a nude Victoria with piano, jazz songs, fairy tales It's awful, without inspiration and talent ! It's shot like music videos with constant zooming, cut, inclined frame so it's just totally not erotic. Victoria's interview is flat and i find it inappropriate to offer a nude segment with her sister. So it's totally Playboy after all : babes are sweet candy and i don't agree. Luckily, as an European, Victoria came back to the old continent and even if her career is forgettable, she succeeded to be a real fantasy girl for all of us !"]},

The basic thesis of the lawyer and the screenwriter is that deviant behaviors are rooted in childhood traumas caused by family or authority figures. It is debatable whether the film was sincerely shot with the aim of promoting such a thesis or whether it is an exploitation film that uses this as a front; I think that both arguments are valid. Regarding the exploitation aspect, the sado-erotic horror/violence scenes contain mise-en-scènes that might be memorable, but the recently surfaced version appears to be a 'trimmed' version: the fotoromanzi edition of the film in my collection is more daring.", "More on its versions: As detailed in Curci & Di Rocco's Visioni proibite book, Eros e Thanatos was flatly and firmly rejected by the censors. The filmmakers then submitted a self-cut and slightly re-edited new version titled Raptus. The censors grudgingly approved that version with even further cuts. Some of the shots ordered by the censor to be cut, such as a killer caressing the dead body of victim (which is visible in the fotoromanzi edition) is missing in the newly surfaced print. On the other hand, some of the scenes which the filmmakers themselves had reportedly cut to appease the censor, such as a flogging scene, is present here.", "-Kaya Özkaracalar."]},

Although it is a little slow and not very exciting to watch, it is well worth the effort. This film is a compliment to the grueling life of a young and articulate native boy. Richard Cardinal was taken from his family at the age of four. He and his siblings were separated and sent to different homes. He had no contact with most of them and no idea of their well being. Richard had a problem with wetting the bed, likely developed because of the trauma he faced in social care; this was the underlying concern that resulted in him being passed from home to home. By the age of seventeen he had been moved 28 times to various foster homes, group homes and shelters within Alberta. He was given no hope, no options, no acceptance. At this point he decided that the only way to stop the pain was to end his life. This movie is disturbing and aggravating. The abuse and neglect that he not only received from foster parents but also from the professionals is appalling. But, I think one of the things this film tries to portray is that Richard is not alone. There were (and are) countless aboriginal children who suffered the same existence. The joy in this story for me is that he killed himself when he did. Not because I think that ending his life was the best option, but because of the family he was with at the time. Had it not been for the wisdom and the love of the foster parents that he was with at that point, Richards story would never have been told. Just like all the other native kids who had found no other way end their suffering. The picture of Richard's body hanging from a tree is one that I will never forget, and I am sure that it was never washed out of the heads of government that received it in the mail either. The whole concept of which is gross and unnecessary, but a perfect reflection of the care that he had received. I just cannot express enough my respect for the ingenious foresight that his foster parents had. And how difficult that must have been for them at the time, to process his death in their care and the shock of seeing a dead body, and then to think immediately of a response that would change the face of childcare in Alberta. That's impressive. Almost as impressive as the fact that Richard lasted seventeen years being treated like a library book."]},

A further three performances were promised and rapidly sold out. Alas, Mrs. Herbert Satterlee, who had attended the dress rehearsal and evidently seen \"something nasty\" in the Judean court if not in the proverbial woodshed, persuaded her father J. P. Morgan to bully the board of the Met into cancelling the remaining performances. Considered \"repugnant to Anglo-Saxon minds\", it was not performed there again until 1934.

This version by J.

I did not read Frederic Dard's novel - or stage play - which it is adapted from. Robert Hossein was involved in some other Dard's stuff adaptings: TOI LE VENIN, LES SCELERATS, but also from James Hadley Chase - MEFIEZ VOUS FILLETTES, CHAIR DE POULE; and Auguste Le Breton: BRIGADE ANTI GANGS, DU RIFIFI CHEZ LES FEMMES, RIFIFI CHEZ LES HOMMES.... Marina Vlady is so gorgeous here."]},

Scratch tells the story of the music with the help of some of the most important scratch pioneers of the last 20 years, such as Babu (of Dilated Peoples and Beat Junkies), DJ Q-Bert and Afrika Bambaataa amongst others. These interviews give us an incite about how the music was born and its growth. We also get helpful tips on the art of scratching from Q-Bert and Mix Master Mike (from The Beastie Boys).", "I am interested in a lot of genres of music, jazz, rock, indie etc. but I have never invested much interest in scratching, sure I have all the classic rap albums, Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Eminem etc. and I have recently got into new hip-hop (a musical genre that uses DJs a lot) such as Dilated Peoples (who's performance in the film made my day), Blackalicious and Jurassic 5 (also featured), but I still had no idea of the art of scratching (or turntablism as it's referred to here), so I went into this movie no sure what to expect.", "This movie is very similar to a lot of the documentaries that have been appearing in the last few years from America, such as Baadasssss Cinema (the story of blacksploitation films), The Backyard and Beyond the Mat (both about the growing popularity of wrestling). But the documentary it seemed to have the most in common with was American Pimp (the story of surprise, surprise American pimps). It was almost the same documentary, sharp editing, grainy camera work, loud soundtrack, sharp dialogue and the DJ's taking over the part of the flamboyant, over the top and eccentric pimps and matching them for madness on every level. And I was justified in my beliefs when I read in the credits that the film was produced by the two directors of American Pimp, Allen and Albert Hughes (who also directed Dead Presidents and From Hell) and later found out that the director of Scratch, Doug Pray was also the editor of American Pimp (he also edited Scratch).", "It's not surprising that it is edited by the director as the editing is an important part of the movie and helps the music get noticed a lot more. He almost makes the footage like the music, rewinding it slowing it down, speeding it up and all sorts of other techniques, which although brilliant do give you a bit of a headache after an hour or so.", "But apart from the moderate headache this is a very good movie that I thing will really change your opinion on scratching if you aren't a fan.

This is identified in IMDb and on the video box as color footage, but I suspect it was simply black & white material tinted to set it apart -think of the night scenes in any silent film where tinting was de rigeur to simulate \"day for night\".", "Two later segments provide the most dramatic action, moving the film from documentary into familiar fiction genres. One has to do with a boy being molested, climaxing in an effective (if hokey) courtroom drama. The other has a step-father raping his 14-year old daughter, with some fine acting by both of them and mom.", "Probably the only segment that strays over the line is an on-screen depiction of a castration operation, as the narrator explains how castration (as opposed to sterilization) lowers the sex drive and is a \"recommended\" cure to prevent sex offenders from recidivism. This graphic footage, brief as it is, squarely puts THE MOLESTERS into the traditional exploitation genre of birth-of-a-baby blood & guts.", "Excellent print quality makes the SWV reissue worthwhile. Coincidentally, the same Swiss production company that made THE MOLESTERS also co-produced (with West Germany) what I've always thought was the best movie on the subject of child molesting, IT HAPPENED IN BROAD DAYLIGHT, starring Gert Frobe in one of his best performances. I watched that one on broadcast TV over 40 years ago via a syndication package, and it was very impressive."]},

In 1899, the hotel burnt to the ground with great loss of life.", "Blackton and his cameraman partner Albert E. Smith rushed to the scene and captured footage while the wreckage was still smouldering. Back in their tiny 10'x12' studio in Brooklyn, they consulted photographs of the Windsor in its previous glory, and built a scale model of the Windsor and the surrounding block, including street lamps and horse carriages. They then set fire to this and filmed the results, while stagehands standing out of camera range blew cigarette smoke towards the camera.", "The resulting film is a weird hybrid. The first sequence is blatantly faked, with the model out of scale and the normal-sized flames out of proportion to the tiny hotel. The 'horses' at the kerb remain placid and motionless in their carriage-tracings, despite the raging fire close by. The smoke is moving towards the hotel from out of frame, rather than originating in the burning building.", "However, after this counterfeit conflagration, the film then cuts to authentic footage of the magnificent Windsor in ruins after the fire. It is this harrowing footage (not the laughable fakery which precedes it) that makes 'Windsor Fire' a significant historic document. And this is almost certainly the very first motion picture to create special-effects footage by using miniatures. I'll rate this early movie 7 out of 10. Pass the marshmallows!"]},

And I mention this because my uncle got new insights from his father-in-law, telling them that the emigration to israel wasn't exactly what it's all cracked up to be, he told him about the struggles of Sepharadic Jews, regarded as \"Arabs\" in the derogatory meaning of the word by the Eureopans, who lived the war, who were part of the Intellegentsia. Less intellectual and more manual, it was hard for them to adapt and many of them returned back or left to other countries, \"A Bit of Luck\" shows such subtleties that are from the typical image of the \"Exodus\" odyssey, yes, the Israeli dream (Eretz Israel) carried that hymn for fraternity but I love the way the film treats this material with less lyrism than the singing parts, coming from Arach' own experience (he was born in Morocco and wrote and directed the film).", "One of the film's saddest moments shows him weeping at his grandfather's tomb before leaving to Israel, we see him having a nice enchanted evening during a wedding where he's literally entranced by the party song (a Moroccan standard) while his spouse is belly dancing, before she would leave the house and force the husband to sign the \"Guett\" so she can divorce and lead a new life, leaving Jojo and Vivi alone before they would take the boat. The arrival to Israel and the adaptation are treated with realism without falling into pathos, we see people trying to get some intimacy in the transit camps, we see the barriers of language between Ashkenazi and Sepharads and what I loved the most is that I could get many jokes told in Arabic in the film, as if I was part of that circle. In a way, I could relate to Jojo. An attempt to sing a Moroccan folk song during a German ceremony turned into a hilarious disaster, leading Jojo to a place where he could find his audience among emigrants from North Africa, at that point Vivi becomes the centerpiece of the film and it loses a bit of its energy.", "I loved Vivi's voice but she's never capable to steal her father's aura, the best part of her singing comes when she dedicates a song to his father and so he does in a powerful montage. Music takes an important part in the film, starting with the very first scene where Jojo, dressed in typical Moroccan clothes sings a serenade to his \"belle\", it's obviously a pre-recorded music (and it's the case for many other scenes) but it gives the film the vibrant energy à la Bollywood, as if it took some distance from reality for the sake of that joie de vivre incarnated in Jojo. He's the heart of the film, one of these characters you don't forget easily, and I didn't. Ever since I saw that film with my mother and our nanny and I could see them crying several times, that film for some reason stuck to my memory, resonating like a nostalgic ode to my country and now that I live far from my family and that, for the first time in my life, I didn't go there for summer, I could feel the pain vividly in my heart, even during happy songs.", "Now, I wish Zahaven Ben who plays adult Vivi could exude the same kind of raw emotion and deliver more than an above average performance and occasionally flat performance, but what she lacks on screen presence, despite an extraordinary voice, she makes it up with that bond she forms with her father. Jojo and Vivi, two repetitive words that resonated twice in my heart, as a Moroccan and as a father of a little girl."]},

To get back to the confusion over which 'primitive' version was included on the DVD, in all fairness, one would be excused in thinking this emanated from the 1910s rather than the last days of the Silent era {sic}, considering the exaggerated acting style  which had been all but surpassed by this time  on display. This, however, is just as easily negated by the brief and pointless instances of nudity in the film  not to mention the presence of German actor Bernhard Goetzke, best-known for playing Death in Fritz Lang's DESTINY (1921). In hindsight, I must admit that my exposure to early Italian cinema has been too scarce to pass objective judgment upon it! ", "Even so, my low rating of the film has more to do with the fact that it's a heavily-condensed version (lasting a measly 57 minutes) of the original, listed on the IMDb as having a hefty 147-minute running-time (presumably, at Silent-film speed)!; besides, the intertitles have been eliminated in favor of a droning narration in English (the epic film, then, seems to have made the U.S. rounds in this ungainly form). For this reason, it races through an elaborate plot featuring innumerable characters; what remains leans, predictably, towards melodrama: Boy loves Girl, Girl is under the spell of Magician, Boy also loved by Blind Waif and another woman (whose rejection leads her to consort with Magician in order to mix a love potion), a pagan Temple-boy sees the error of his ways and converts to Christianity, Magician kills the latter and is blackmailed by a greedy but unwise eye-witness, Boy (mystified by the drug) finds himself accused of the young priest's murder and is sentenced to fight for his life in the arena, Blind Waif (who's prone to atrocious singing and harp-playing!) finally sacrifices herself so as not to stand in the path of True Love, etc.", "All of which, of course, leads to the volcanic eruption that's the true raison d'etre of the popular tale  a spectacle which redeems this version to some extent. By the way, Victor Varconi  who plays the part of the hero  subsequently had a long career in Hollywood as a character actor; as for director Gallone, he too kept on working steadily for many years afterwards (I have his CARMEN DI TRASTEVERE [1962] in my \"To Watch\" list recorded off late-night Italian TV, a modernization of another much-filmed source  Prosper Merimee''s \"Carmen\", which also inspired the famous Georges Bizet opera)."]},

I found this entry to be among the best in the series just because these are jobs we all know exist but might not know what goes on with them. I'm sure a documentary today would be more detailed about the subject but it's important to remember when this was made. I found the story involving the postal inspectors to be the most interesting but film buffs would benefit even more by checking out the Bela Lugosi film Postal Inspector."]},

The film interweaves two main story lines, each fate-driven to collide with a host of peripheral dramas or mini-universes: an environmentalist meeting, a bum in an alleyway, a cocktail waitress on her way home, a professional hit-man hallucinating in a park, a family on its way to cemetery, etc. And each intersection of the main story lines with themselves, or with the peripheral story lines correlates to some specific dramatic style or phase: tragedy, melodrama, Chaplin-esque slapstick, crime thriller, philosophic, and, in the end, Twilight Zonish (or \"Return of the Mummy\"-ish). Afterall, the \"unlucky monkey\" is all humanity.", "Each flip from one style or phase to the next is transitioned - unfortunately so, to my taste - not by a fade or short black-screen, but by a very excessive stop- or slow-motion study of some ultimate moment. These transitions so wore on my patience that I pressed fast-forward to escape. But even in fast-forward, I found them annoyingly long and static.", "In imposing those transitions on us poor viewers, as though infatuated with what he thought some original and arty technique, the director was frankly destructively self-indulgent and probably deaf to whatever free-minded advisers he had during editing. I can't imagine another monkey on this planet with patience enough to sit through them - unless intended as mini-intermissions for making a few phone calls, mixing some lemonade and making some popcorn before returning.", "With very little editing, this could have been a really good flick. Acting, scenery and artistic direction are good, and the environmentalist meeting sequence is among the most hilarious I've ever seen."]},

An expedition went to the Tiburon Island to try and see if there are really Seri Indians living there. We're told that the Seri people left America after not trusting the people there yet no one really knew where they went and if there were any still alive. The expedition wasn't supported by the U.S. or Mexican governments but they did find some natives and the footage we see is what was shot at the time of the mission. This is without question a very interesting little gem as we're basically seeing these people for the first time. It was fascinating to see these new discoveries as well as hearing their stories and what we're told is their race suicide where there's going to be no more children so that they can simply kill off their own race. I'm sure if these events happened today there would be all sorts of great looking HD footage but this is 1940 we're talking about but what we get is still terrific footage. In today's day and age it's sometimes easy to forget that there were uncharted places very close to us not too long ago. John Nesbitt makes it clear that these people were living just 600 miles from Los Angeles yet no one knew they were there. This is certainly a film that makes you do a search to try and see what happened to these people since the time of the original release."]},

Set in Jia's home city of Fengyang in Shanxi province, the film is basically a series of incidents in the life of  petty thief and pickpocket, Xiao Wu. It is a compelling portrait of an individual in free-fall and, like other films by the director, shows the corrupting influence of Western values on an entire generation of Chinese. The film is reminiscent of the works of Robert Bresson in its use of non-professional actors, environmental sound, and in its spare cinematography by Yu Lik-Wai. ", "Xiao Wu (Hong Wei Wang) wanders about aimlessly with lots of money to spend and little to spend it on except call girls at the local karaoke bar. He befriends Mei Mei (Hao Hongjian), and they start to develop a tentative relationship but his social awkwardness leads to ultimate rejection. Wu's friends have given up the life of crime and do not want to have anymore to do with him. His best friend, Jin Xiao Yong has just been voted a \"Model Entrepreneur\" for his activities in cigarette trafficking and does not invite Wu to his wedding. He even returns Wu's gift of money because it is \"tainted\". The scene between the two old friends discussing the wedding is heartbreaking in the look of rejection on Wu's face. ", "With no other work to fall back on, Wu is forced to continue his petty crimes, constantly running afoul of the police. In the background, the government has issued an order to round up street criminals. Wu seems bewildered by the fact that his friends do not want to associate with him and he is unable to grasp the meaning of the police crackdown. He grows increasingly alienated and lonely as he loses his friends who go straight, his girl friend Mei Mei who leaves town, and his family who eject him after an argument over a ring.", "Jia captures the rhythm and feel of day-to-day life in Fengyang. This is life as it is actually lived, not as a series of dramatic events forced into a narrative structure. His film succeeds not only as social commentary but also as an acutely perceptive realization of the psychology of a self-absorbed individual. One of the most revealing scenes is when Wu stubbornly refuses to sing with Mei Mei at the karaoke bar but instead goes to a bathhouse and, alone and naked, sings a plaintive song to the empty room. After Mei Mei leaves him, things seem to spiral downward for Wu. In a final sequence, he is shown after his arrest, not as a victim or hero, but as an off-screen object to be gazed at and mocked by people in the street. It is a scene of personal tragedy, but in the universality of its compassion, it becomes a spiritual revelation. Xiao Wu is one of the best films of the 90s."]},

It offers monsters, action, humor, amazing special effects and very WELL DEVELOPED SCRIPTS (lacking from some other Ultra series). Jack Shindo is a great character, too bad the actor playing him hasn't done more films. The first half deals with the monster/poison named Gudis (edited for a feature direct to video). Even if the plot can become a little slow...the special effects can more than make up for it. The second half deals with...RANDOM CREATURES! Free of Gudis (personally, I don't get this. I mean, the natural monsters/mutations stop comming to let Gudis go ahead and destroy, wait for Ultraman to slay it, then go back to attacking). Despite the flaw, the writer does a good job here. My last nitpick is the fact that the character of Charles Morgan got VERY IRRITATING in some points and the fact that the Kudara costume looked awful on screen. Standing still it was realistic, but while fighting/rampaging, VERY OBVIOUS FOLDS CAN BE SEEN! Ultraman himself was well staged, had everything that a superhero needed to be (better than Superman!). Tall, (if 330ft counts) muscular, (no Bruce Lee, but passable) fires many beam weapons, knows very comic- bookesque poses, fight sceens are very realistic (makes the 90's Gamera look bad) and has a bit of humor in him. JACK: (upon being defeated by Kudara, and discovering another creature is on he loose) So we're in trouble. ULTRAMAN: You got it! JACK: What can we do? ULTRMAN: I'm open to suggestions.

But it just seems that in \"Bride of Chucky\" you actually feel some chemistry going on between him and Tiffany. Not only that, but it always seems that in the \"Child's Play\" series you could never really tell if Chucky's dead or not, whether he's shot in the heart, exploded into bits of pieces, or hacked up in a huge fan.", "This film also includes some memorable scenes, for example, the stunning segment where that guy gets blown to bits by getting hit by that huge truck. Pure genius from the film's screenwriter, and creator of characters, Don Mancini.", "Yes, shocking was the movie, the ending especially. Some good dialogue, a great plotline, pulse pounding suspense, and a hard-hitting soundtrack, \"Bride of Chucky\" promises everything the previews do and may become a famous pick-out in the horror genre. Highly reccomended for die-hard fans of the \"Child's Play\" series."]},

Paquito (Alberto Fernández de Rosa) is a naïve orphan who lives with his uncle and aunt and works at their neighborhood grocery store. As his legal guardians leave for Mar del Plata, Paquito's chance encounter with Delia develops into a close yet complex relationship. _Breve cielo_ traces this brief encounter, and we see the characters walking around Buenos Aires, having coffee, talking about life. The premise is simple, but it is full of energy and spontaneity. I was reminded of Truffaut, who saw no difference between the cinema and life. _Breve cielo_ is somewhere between _The 400 Blows_ and _Stolen Kisses_, without being exactly \"Antoine and Colette.\" The young actors' performances are brilliant, and Astor Piazzolla's music is aptly poignant. Scenes from the streets of Buenos Aires make the city almost a character in itself.", "The title of the film is perfect. Heaven--like Hell--is supposed to be forever. We should be content if we get to experience it briefly, the film seems to say. The phrase is from Pedro Calderón de la Barca's play _La vida es sueño_ (1635). Paquito's uncle gives the viewer a clue when he says, \"Life is a dream.\" In the play, one of the characters, Segismundo, says that if man is a \"small (or brief) Earth\" (a common metaphor of those times), then woman must be a \"small (or brief) Heaven.\"", "_Breve cielo_, which received an award for best screenplay at the Moscow International Film Festival, is one of the best Argentinean films I've seen. I may be biased, as I absolutely love the French Nouvelle Vague (especially Truffaut, who is my favorite director), but I still urge everyone to see it."]},

Believing Ray's soul to be inhabiting the doll, Tiffany crudely stitches Chucky back together and reenacts the voodoo ritual which instilled Ray inside the doll a decade ago. Though her chants initially fail to produce results, Chucky unexpectedly springs to life and smothers Tiffany's goth admirer, Damien (Alexis Arquette), as Tiffany looks on with excitement. Chucky, who is still intent on becoming human again, lays out a plan to retrieve the body-switching amulet Ray was wearing on the night he was killed. The amulet was buried along with his body in a cemetery in Hackensack, New Jersey.", "Hoping to pick up where she and Ray left off, Tiffany presents Chucky with a diamond ring which he left for her. Upon realizing that Tiffany believed the gift to be an engagement ring, Chucky bursts out laughing, explaining that he stole it from one of his wealthier victims when he was a notorious human serial killer. Heartbroken and enraged, Tiffany punishes Chucky by locking him in a playpen. That next morning, Tiffany approaches a young neighbor, Jesse (Nick Stabile) with an offer to ferry Chucky's body across state lines in exchange for money. Eager to elope with his girlfriend, Jade (Katherine Heigl), and having been foiled in the past by her possessive uncle, Chief Warren Kincaid (John Ritter), Jesse accepts the offer.", "Inside Tiffany's mobile home, Chucky tries to woo her into freeing him. As a mocking gesture, Tiffany responds by lowering a female children's doll, clad in a miniature wedding dress, into Chucky's playpen. Now irate, Chucky breaks free and surprises Tiffany while she is bathing, dropping a television set into her bathtub and electrocuting her to death. Still dragging the bridal doll, Chucky then recites the familiar voodoo chant, transferring Tiffany's soul into the doll. Chucky blackmails her by pointing out her only hope for becoming human again is to help him steal the amulet. After Tiffany makes a series of vivid alterations to her doll body, the killers pretend to be inanimate as Jesse arrives to pick up the dolls. He then goes to rendezvous with Jade, unaware that the dolls plan on appropriating their bodies once they have the amulet.", "Midway into the trip, Jade's uncle tracks down the van and starts to inspect it while the couple is away. Annoyed by Kincaid's interference, the killers rig a trap which embeds several nails into the Chief's face, then hide his body inside an onboard trunk. Later, Jesse and Jade stop for supplies and attract the notice of a police officer, who detects the scent of marijuana (which Chucky is smoking). Chucky mistakenly throws the narcotics into view, giving the officer enough cause to detain Jesse. Chucky sneaks over to the officer's squad car, stuffs a wadded-up shirt into the gas tank, and lights it on fire, killing the officer in an explosion.", "Shaken by the prospect that one of them might be a murderer, Jesse and Jade nevertheless stop at a couples-only hotel to get married. During the ceremony, Chief Kincaid awakens and rises out from the trunk in which Chucky and Tiffany had hidden him. Before he can crawl away, Chucky stabs him repeatedly in the back and re-deposits his body inside the trunk. Meanwhile, Jesse and Jade make the acquaintance of a pair of swingers who pickpocket their money. Tiffany follows the thieves to their private room and tosses a bottle of champagne at the mirrored ceiling above their bed, fatally impaling the couple with shards of glass. Chucky is aroused by this spectacle, and dolls have sex in the blood-soaked room.", "After a maid discovers the corpse that next morning, Jesse and Jade are both convinced that the other is a killer. Following another escape, they are surprised to run into their mutual friend and confidante, David (Gordon Michael Woolvett), who informs them that they are wanted for multiple murders. Whilst driving, David convinces both to stop accusing each other and patch things up. Upon realizing their misunderstanding, Jesse and Jade resolve their differences. However, David smells a foul odor and uncovers Jade's dead uncle inside the trunk. Concealing his horror, David carefully takes the Chief's gun and order Jesse to pull over, prompting Chucky to reveal himself to everyone. Startled by what he has seen, David unknowingly backs into the path of an oncoming semi truck and is fatally struck before figuring out Jade and Jesse are innocent. A radio announcement informs Chucky the fingerprints found at the scene have been identified as those of Charles Lee Ray, and that authorities plan to exhume his body as part of the investigation.", "With the van now under suspicion, the dolls transfer their quarry into a stolen recreational vehicle. Jesse is forced to be their driver while Tiffany gives Jade a makeover, getting her ready for when they transfer bodies. As the group nears the Hackensack cemetery, Jesse quips to Chucky that Tiffany \"isn't much of a homemaker\", due to the fact that there are several dishes in the sink. In response, Chucky orders Tiffany to clean up a little. Jade, taking her lead from Jesse, confides to Tiffany, \"You were nice enough to cook for him. The least he could do is wash a dish\", igniting a loud, volatile argument between the dolls. In the confusion, Jesse intentionally swerves off the road and crashes, while Tiffany is knocked into the oven by Jade. Still tied to a chair, Jade lays trapped and sees that Tiffany is still alive, though badly charred. Jesse cuts Jade free and pulls her out of the RV before sparking wiring causes the vehicle to explode. Jesse is blown clear, but Jade is taken hostage by Chucky.", "Chucky approaches his open grave site, shoots the gravedigger exhuming his body in the back of the head, and sends Jade in to open his coffin at gunpoint. She reluctantly retrieves the amulet and throws it to him, but Jesse reappears, dragging Tiffany by her hair. Chucky agrees to let Jade go in exchange for Tiffany. When the couples reunite, Chucky ties the teenagers together and starts to perform the ritual. Touched by Jesse and Jade's love for each other, and seeing Chucky's disgust at her disfigurement, Tiffany betrays Chucky by stabbing him in the back, quoting from Bride of Frankenstein: \"Oh, Chucky, look at us. Don't you see? We belong dead.\"", "Tiffany releases the teenagers from their bonds, but Chucky retaliates by attacking Tiffany with a shovel. Chucky gets the upper hand, stabbing Tiffany in the chest; however, Jesse retrieves the shovel and knocks Chucky into his own grave, trapping him in the 6-foot pit. As Chucky screams and curses, a police Lieutenant (Lawrence Dane) who has been pursuing the suspicious teens arrives and witnesses the living doll. Jade takes the detective's gun and aims at Chucky, who promises to one day return just like in every sequel of the film series; \"But dying is such a bitch.\" Chucky is shot to death, his lifeless body collapsing next to his former human shell.", "In the aftermath of what he has just witnessed, the Lieutenant radios in to report Jade and Jesse are innocent, and allows them to run away together. Before the rest of police unit can arrive, the Lieutenant discovers Tiffany's body. After poking her a few times, the charred doll springs to life. The Lieutenant screams in horror as a screeching, sharp-tooth baby emerges from beneath Tiffany's dress and attacks him."]},

Other favourites being 'Three Sisters' and 'Uncle Vanya'. It is a masterclass of complex characterisation and mood, while Chekhov's characters were not what one considers \"likeable\" they are complex and real and he was a master at creating vivid atmosphere. There are plenty of fantastic moments in Chekhov's text, his writing style was heavily criticised and scorned at in his day but it is not a problem with me, other than taking a bit of time initially to get used to the wordiness.", "To me, any film or television adaptation that dares go near Chekhov (incredibly difficult to adapt and has been adapted and performed to variable effect) deserves some kind of pat on the back. This version of 'The Cherry Orchard' has a good deal going for it, such as the lead cast and the production values, but doesn't quite come together due to primarily the pacing and that the tone of the film didn't feel right with too much of one tone and not enough of the other.", "It does succeed in quite a lot of areas. The lead cast are very good, Alan Bates is very well cast in the kind of role he did so well and does intensely fierce and tortured incredibly well in a way that isn't overwrought. Charlotte Rampling also gives a thoughtful, committed performance that has fire, poignancy and elegance without being melodramatic. Michael Gough and Katrina Cartridge stand out, particularly Cartridge.", "Visually, this version of 'The Cherry Orchard' is beautiful. The costumes and settings are truly sumptuous and the photography doesn't come over as static and is just as elegant. While having issues with how it was used, the music itself is hauntingly melancholic and fits very well with the tragic aspect of the story. It does help that Tchaikovsky, which it is heavy in, is one of my favourite composers and with him being a very troubled man in real life which is reflected in a lot of his music he was an ideal fit. The ending is also very moving, the play's ending itself is one of the most moving there is and it takes a lot for it to be ruined, something that none of the versions seen of 'The Cherry Orchard' have done.", "However, 'The Cherry Orchard' is an example of a film that finishes a lot more strongly than it starts. Quite a lot of the pacing for my tastes is very dull, especially the truly tedious prologue that doesn't really say anything. Sometimes one sees a film etc that has a scene that comes over as neither interesting or necessary, and the prologue here is one of those films. It also suffers from the opposite issue the generally quite impressive National Theatre Live production had, which succeeded brilliantly in the comedic elements but under cooked some of the drama. Here the dramatic moments have moments where it is very moving and melancholic, but as an adaptation no matter how faithful it is in detail it comes over as over-serious from the satire being pretty much missing.", "Did find a lot of the supporting cast to be too hammy, that is including the usually fun to watch Frances De La Tour (one of the worst offenders in my view actually). While the music is beautiful, it perhaps could have been used less and not emphasised the mood as much as it does. It is stodgy in direction too, especially in the early stages, and even for a wordy play the film feels too much so because of the momentum not being there.", "In conclusion, watchable but underwhelming considering the source material and the cast. 5/10."]},

Most of the McGoohan Columbo movies are some really classy made ones, that are well directed and also better than the average Columbo movie entries. You can say that a McGoohan Columbo movie is always something special, even though not all are quite as good, such as for instance the failure \"Columbo: Last Salute to the Commodore\".

He's still alive and kicking though, so he might once pop up in a movie again, though I assume that he is enjoying his retirement. He always had some good interaction with Peter Falk within the Columbo movies, probably also due to the fact that they have been close friends for years.

Like the director's previous films, this is a story of marginal characters (specifically, of a man and a woman), but in terms of genre, it is an example of film noir, in contrast to the urban realism of _Breve cielo_ (1969) and _Prisioneros de una noche_ (1960).", "El Flaco (Norberto Aroldi), a thief, and Vilma (María Aurelia Bisutti), a prostitute, share a small apartment in Buenos Aires. Their bond is strong and complicated. One day, on a whim, they steal a car and race other vehicles, stopping once to rob a rich old lady of an expensive brooch she is wearing. El Flaco and Vilma end up in prison, but she soon gets out. Gustavo (José María Langlais), a rich architect she once helped has bailed her out, but of course, he expects something in return. While el Flaco serves time, Vilma realizes she has moved from one form of confinement to another. Both of them long for their lost freedom, and for each other.", "Aroldi and Bisutti are great as reckless, self-destructive lovers. Bisutti gave a memorable performance as a good, respectable girl in _Los de la mesa 10_ (Simón Feldman, 1960), and she is equally convincing here as a woman of the night. Vilma may well be what Delia, Ana María Picchio's character in _Breve cielo_, eventually becomes.", "_Con alma y vida_ is more ambitious than Kohon's previous films. It features car chases and shootouts, and the setting switches at one point from Buenos Aires to Punta del Este, Uruguay. The result, however, is not entirely satisfactory. The film is marred by melodrama, and there are even weak spots in the script. The character of Gustavo, for instance, disappears in the middle of the film. Finally, the movie is commercial and follows genre conventions, two things that the \"generación del 60\" (to which Kohon belonged) shunned, as it espoused artistic freedom.", "It seems that with _Con alma y vida_ Kohon was trying something different. Fortunately, he would then abandon film noir and find a different and much more interesting approach. Seven years would pass before he made his next film, _¿Qué es el otoño?_, but this one was worth the wait. _Con alma y vida_ is not a bad film, and it's definitely Kohon, but it is in _Breve cielo_ and in _Tres veces Ana_ (1961) that one sees this director at his best."]},

I wish I had discovered it years ago. I highly recommend it."]},

Let me just start off by pointing out that Goremet Zombie Chef From Hell is a truly awesome title for a B-movie. That is not my opinion, that is an undisputed fact. If only I could think of one positive quality this film has going for it, then maybe I could feel like a little less of a fool for actually paying money for this steaming pile of awful. It's not like I expected a hell of a lot, but I had planned on buying it from Amazon for a long time, all the while, assuming some outlandish cult cinema awaited me. Now, I just feel like a moron for putting that much thought into it. I sat through the whole thing, and I honestly can't think of one word uttered, one plot twist, one single thing that happened. Just a bunch of talking. However, I did notice the music from the beginning. The very much stolen music, which is what gets under my skin the most, because I can't think of what movie it's from. So, that's it, eh? A title like that, and all I get is a bunch of talking, and an irritating mystery? It just never occurred to anyone to give something, to, somehow, back the title up with something to make someone, anyone want to watch this disappointment. By the way, if you're waiting for a description of this movie, it ain't happening. You got to watch out for these awesome-titled disappointments. Not too long ago, I came across a dud called Please Don't Eat The Babies. An intriguing title to say the least, so, naturally, I expected some form of outlandish humor, but no, not even close. And yeah, I am a little embarrassed by some of my recent choices for B-entertainment, but not nearly as much as some of these directors should be. Oh well, that's what I get for buying rare, low-budget Horror movies based only on the fact that they're rare. My advice would be to forget all about the Boremet sleep-aid from Hell, and go seek out something more worth while, like Teen Ape Goes To Camp, or Death Bed: The Bed That Eats. I don't know, you'd probably be better off not taking my advice, and just deciding for yourself. Just know, if you pursue this movie, you will regret it. 1/10"]},

Black King was good of course, but the real scene stealer was the actor Felix Valle whose characterization of Charlie was on mark. He displayed his incredible trick roping skills and I was in awe, the best I've ever seen! This flick had good acting, a good story, decent directing and kept my interest throughout it's 57 minute duration. My only wish was that the same cast would have been used in other movies since they all were so enjoyable. Racketeer Roundup (1934), aka: Gunners & Guns (1934) is a flick that won't disappoint. An interesting side note, since I was so intrigued by Felix, I looked him up and was pleasantly suprised to see that two of his movies were posted on YouTube, Kidding Katie (1923) and Stay Single (1924), both Christie Comedies movies staring the equally talented Dorothy Devore that deserves her star status being both cute and funny in each movie. Felix did no trick roping in either picture, but held his ground in two very likable roles. It's interesting too, to see how versatile actors are able to transition into two different genres of movies. One can truly appreciate such talent."]},

It is a film that one can laugh out loud at its pure ridiculousness.  It takes one `random' 24-hour period and illustrates that guns, by themselves, killed over 60 people in this country.  This is pretty remarkable since I never believed inanimate objects were capable of murder, although the director of this film feels quite the opposite.", "Of course, this movie includes gun related suicides (as if those committing suicides with firearms wouldn't have found another way to end their lives if guns ceased to exist), and it even mentions an instance where a policeman used a gun for SELF DEFENSE (surely defending one's self is a horrible idea in the director's sick mind) in order to exaggerate the death toll and make the problem of gun related violence worse than it really is. And of course, the director fails to mention which guns were obtained through illegal means (I'm sure the majority of the guns that were used in the gang-related murders were not purchased through licensed firearms dealers).  Though the movie does not specifically call for increased gun control or a ban on guns, such an agenda was clearly tangible.", "If you are looking for an asinine film that explains that people aren't responsible for the actions that they commit with firearms (rather, then guns themselves are responsible for the crimes) then surely this film will satiate your extremist left-wing appetite.  On the other hand, if you have half a brain, then take my advice and do not believe the nonsense that this movie attempts to illustrate.  Better yet, avoid this movie entirely."]},

It's interesting as an equivalent to the kinds of films that were made a few years earlier in North America, mostly in the immediate wake of \"Easy Rider,\" showing footloose youth just traveling, \"finding themselves,\" and getting into underplotted mild trouble. Most of those movies weren't very good (save as timepieces), and this isn't very good either, except in the novelty of offering a similar, seemingly apolitical view behind the Iron Curtain, where we assume life for youth wasn't so footloose. But as presented here, it looks much the same, albeit a little drabber--the street life and beach scenes here are hardly golden California vistas, with plenty of corpulent and middle-aged folk glimpsed. The protagonist seems to get a certain amount of hostility from strangers at times, apparently just for being young and long-haired. But there's no mainstream/counterculture division spelled out, and indeed you don't get much sense that there's any real deprivation going on here for anyone--our trucker protagonist considers signing on for more ambitious routes that would apparently let him visit Western and other Eastern European nations without any trouble.", "As a snapshot of the era, \"Kangaroo\" is intriguing enough, but unless you have some personal interest in the time and place, there just isn't a lot here to compel attention. The hero has pleasant-enough looks and personality, but that's about the most one can say; he hasn't got any special charisma, and isn't a striking camera subject. Why do all these very pretty girls keep turning up and throwing themselves at him? It would make sense if the film were a standard young man's fantasy of the period, in which girls do that sort of thing because that's what male audiences (and filmmakers) would want them to do. But this movie purports to be fairly realistic, so it rings false. Nor do we understand why he doesn't brush off the teenager who's infatuated with him, as he doesn't want to be tied down at his age and justifiably sees her as immature. When he changes his mind, there are some plot mechanizations that might have guilt-tripped (or shotgun-wedding'd) him into it, but not into simply starting to love her. She is all too credibly clingy and hysterical in ways that might well simply be the emotional fever of a 17-year-old, soon to pass. As a result, the \"happy ending\" feels like a mistake--do these people really belong together? Will they even like each other in another couple years?", "\"Kangaroo\" doesn't dig deep enough to ask such questions. It's breezy in a way that may well have seemed refreshing to local audiences at the time--I can't say I have a strong grip on how different it might have been from the general Hungarian cinema of 1976. But now it just seems too casual about narrative and character to offer more than a Polaroid of moderetely hippie-ish (but still gainfully employed) youth in that milieu, without much context that would make it meaningful to foreign (or latterday) viewers. It's well-made, but there just isn't much substance here to take away with you."]},

Fascism is not considered a thing of the past as fascist tendencies can be seen in all contemporary political systems. Italian film \"March on Rome\" was made in 1962,a time when cinema was considered an important part of cultural life. It was a time when Italian cinema enjoyed a high level of popularity both from critics as well as general public. The choice of a film about 'fascism' and its actual making surprised many a viewer as nobody had expected a film to be made on it. March on Rome depicts what happened to Italian nation 40 years ago when fascists were making elaborate plans to gain political control through persuasion as well as violent means. This film begins in Milan with a young man Domenico Rocchetti using different ingenious tricks to extract money from people. He is compelled to behave like a tramp as he does not have enough money to eat. It is at this juncture that through sheer chance that he bumps into Capitano Paolinelli who is recruiting some members to fascist party. This fortuitous meeting gives rise to a series of tragicomic episodes. They can be considered good historical material as they highlight the confusion which must have prevailed during the rise of fascism in Italy. Apart from two legendary actors of Italian cinema Vittorio Gassman (Domenico Rocchetti) and Ugo Tognazzi (Umberto Gavazza), veteran French actor Roger Hanin plays an important role as Capitano Paolinelli who fervently urges ordinary people to join fascism in order to show their opposition to Bolsheviks. One who has seen films by Italian master of comedy \"Dino Risi\" would not fail to observe how humor plays an important role in this film which might be considered \"political\" by many people."]},

Created by Saban as another attempt to capitalize on the success they had Mighty Morphin Power Rangers (the one before it, VR Troopers, which mashed various series from the Metal Hero series, would be in its second and final season shortly before it premiered). Taking stock footage and elements from Kamen Rider Black RX, all well as movies Kamen Rider ZO and Kamen Rider J, this series takes the same formula MMPR and VR Troopers has done: use Japanese stock footage alongside American footage to create a entirely different show. In fact, Masked Rider would first appear in the three part Season 3 premiere of the former, however, when Masked Rider became a show, Saban decided to retcon the events of the series and have the hero based in his own universe. Another thing it copies is its use of comic relief characters. We have Patsy and Herbie, who serves as the show's Bulk and Skull, and then there's Ferbus, whom some fans call the worst character, as he is only there to cause most of the hijinks ( be it getting a trio of Maggots into a food fight or catching two burglars hired by Nefaria to kidnap him).", "The episodes sometimes deal with issues like Power Rangers does. One episode involves Albie being bullied into a challenge at the arcade, which Dex accepts, with another episode having the kids start a clean up program, which echoes back to the MMPR episode Teamwork. While the episodes are neat, and have some original concepts, they still feel too silly due to Ferbus' antics. Also, Dex does spew some one-liners during battle, and they can be either funny or groan inducing. This series only got 40 episodes before being axed due to being a commercial flop (and it didn't help that the toys did not sell like MMPR's did), but this is an interesting adaptation that, despite its flaws, is a neat curiosity."]},

A couple local cops take them out to a farmer's house but he's trained his three daughters to sexually fulfill the men when they arrive. In terms of any type of film, this here is pretty white trash as the 75-minutes drag by and there's really not too much that happens here. The film is quite a mess because it appears to have been about three different films at some point in time. It starts off as a pretty straight-forward, white trash comedy but then we get a couple softcore sex scenes. Before you know it this softcore scene turns hardcore thanks to some inserts that are obviously other actors doing the actual sex. We then flash to another scene where the actors actually do the hardcore scenes themselves. I'm not certain why each scene is a complete opposite from the next but this happens throughout the movie. In one scene an actress will be doing hardcore but her next scene with someone else will feature inserts with other actors doing the sex. I'm sure not too much thought should be put into it as this movie is just a cheap piece of trash that doesn't have much of anything going for it. The sex scenes are all extremely boring, non-erotic and are poorly shot. The \"acting\" going on is pretty embarrassing as well even when the screenplay gives them a couple good moments including one where the redneck cop pulls down the FBI man's pants and sees his underwear. The redneck doesn't know what they are and thinks the guy must be a Communist. That's pretty much all this film has to offer and there are certainly much better redneck films out there."]},

Glamourpuss Adams proves an even bigger surprise, delivering a mature performance of great warmth that will keep audiences guessing as to which way Herschel's heart should go. With only two women at its center (be warned, the other listed female stars, while prominently billed, only appear as non-sex extras), this one should go over big with the ladies, at least if they are not put off by even bigger '80s hair !"]},

A followup film with the same two female leads, 1969's THE DAISY CHAIN, is apparently lost.", "The story and ensemble acting make THE MUTHERS a cut above the competition, and perhaps even on a par with Joe Sarno's more famous output from this period.

With a local bar run by porn stalwart Steve Vincent as the meet market, housewives Marsha Jordan and Virginia Gordon enjoy picking up men for one-night stands.

Filmmakers at this time were not overly worried about accusations of \"kiddie porn\", as Bond mentions her mom being only 32 years old, which would definitely make her character underage.", "Also most impressive in a big-bust femme cast is a Davis regular Linda O'Bryant as Linda, another horny housewife (who also appears in the elusive THE DAISY CHAIN opposite Marsha Jordan again). Her huge orbs should have merited some sort of cult following.", "As a testament to the film's craftsmanship and excellent pacing, I was actually surprised when it ended on a dramatic note, expecting another reel or two of beautiful femmes disrobing and coupling. That's a pretty rare occurrence for this genre of film, generally all padding and no content. Perhaps a clue to the film's lapse into obscurity is its absence of explicitness -for 1968 the omission of any full-frontal nude shots, and men generally keeping their underwear (or bathing suits) on was behind the times. Another oddity is (at least on my cursory view) having star Kathy Williams (playing Jordan's daughter) not showing any skin here even though her career consists of skin flicks."]},

Given two sex scenes, first a one-on-one with Moana, and later a d.p. alongside Tom Chapman on the blonde beauty from Italy, Peter North elects to sort of go anonymous, though fans of his cum shots can spot him a mile away.

The cinematic contrast would be Rainer Werner Fassbinder (almost mainstream) and Joe Sarno (porn division), who cranked out 100% finished, perfect in their own way miniatures like clockwork. Christian and Dance subconsciously must have feared getting a report card, so they took the easy way out -underachieving.", "It's a shame, because the sustained neo-noir atmosphere of the early reels is compelling, before the movie collapses in shambles (I'm evaluating the obviously truncated SWV version).

Auditions include an impressive topless femme fire eater.", "Leslie is a sellout, while romantic Seeman still has illusions of someday opening a wonderful piano bar where he can tinkle the ivories and feel fulfilled.

II dark classics, the mood is glum and hopeless, with sex the only (temporary) release.", "Handling the sex is my fave Joan Devlon, a glamorous but seedy cocktail waitress who has sex with all and sundry at the drop of a hat. These basic characters, had they been fully developed, could have been the core of a terrific tale, but scripter Joseph Drury settles for hip dialog and tantalizing situations, but no satisfying conclusions.", "The truncated SWV print might be at fault, as two couples in the credits, the Howards and the Stevens never even show up. But what exists on the DVD seems pointless. Drury's earlier credits, two exploitation films that I've seen in both softcore and insert-enhanced XXX versions, are likewise promising stories that fail to add up.", "In NIGHT PLEASURES the main protagonist turns out to be lovely young Melba Bruce, who IMDb notes committed suicide after a career lasting only a year, mainly in support roles. She's sympathetic as a girl desperate for a job, who will basically do anything (and does). Seeman falling for her in the traditional dark romantic noir fashion is his undoing.", "Haphazard construction (at least in the print I watched) has a violent climax involving Seeman followed by a sexy three-way for Leslie, West and Devlon, ending abruptly and pointlessly. It's frustrating.", "Along the way, the girls are fabulous and the sex is hot -the typical porn cop-out that precludes criticism. All three leading ladies are cast for their spectacularly alluring nipples, lovingly photographed. The moody lighting, claustrophobic nightclub setting (we never leave the damn place) and downbeat performances (other than Joan's) add up to commendable art. I just wish these guys had worked harder and made a real film.", "I see that writer/producer Dance went on to some famous porn films, including hits directed by Joanna Williams, and even moved into the R-rated territory later on.

The two women make out and then go down on each other as the bar's patrons watch. Seeing Nikki in her long black boots and Darrian in just a pair of high heels making love to each other is an amazing sight. Later, one of the bikers, played by Derrick Lane gets the girls up on the bar as he takes turns with them both as the two girls continue to eat each other out. Lucky guy! Watching all this with great pleasure is lesbian porn queen Felicia and her biker girlfriend. In the next scene, the two biker chicks wake up a sleeping Nikki and coax her into some hot sex. Nikki's still got her lucky boots on, but she's dressed in tight white vest and orange silk panties. The two girls take turns riding Nikki's face as the other goes down on Nikki. There's a lot of switching around in this scene. Felicia's friend is a bit of a dog, but Felicia's body looks awesome. Nikki, of course, looks staggering. As is the norm with Tyler scenes, she does manage to do some of her magical ass- eating. She splits open Felica and gives her a nice tongue lashing, while her tongue-ringed biker girl clamps onto Nikki's muffin like there's no tomorrow.

The facts are these - one of the first black men in the US air force, he left the uncongenial political atmosphere of his home country for Europe, in particular a Paris always open to artistic bravery.", "Having directed a few shoestring shorts, he discovered a French law whereby novelists could get grants for filming their work.  Novels promptly written, he made an extraordinary feature about interracial love, visualising the white woman's fear of consummation as tribal cannibal rape.  The film won a prestigious American award, and Van Peebles was flooded with Hollywood offers, it being assumed he was a (white) Dutch auteur.  In the heated climate of the late 60s, Van Peebles became a prominent sympathiser of the Black Panthers, but turned out a few compromised Hollywood 'liberal' films.", "Angry that Hollywood had earmarked him for the role of token black director, he took Columbia's money, and produced with complete independence, starring, as the credits boasted, 'The Black Community', SWEETBACK, a film, despite its flaws and contentious assumptions, still sings with savagery and beauty. It was the bomb with black audiences in America, who saw it as the first truly black film, and went on to become the highest grossing independent feature of all time.", "Reactionary whites were predictable appalled at such an aggressive celebration of black experience, one that showed indifference to cosy, compromised accommodation.  The happy ending didn't help either - violent rebels should be punished.  Hollywood responded by blacklisting Van Peebles, banning the film from export until recently, and creating its own neutered blaxploitation movies in response.  But Van Peebles kept on going, writing revolutionary Broadway shows and bestselling novels.", "I said that these were the facts - the problem is that the documentary is too one-sided, or at least, one-voiced.  There is little contribution from the man himself besides repeated shots of him jogging, and wonderful archive footage.  There are no interviews with film or cultural critics, or other directors or politicians to put this extraordinary man in context.  The metaphor of running (a motif, er, running through all his work) is overextended, suggesting flight rather than confrontation.  Still, there's lots of priceless clips from his very-difficult-to-see early films, lovely Van Peebles music, often cited as an early influence on hip-hop, and a tone of deserved righteous homage."]},

(Oops... lol) I also avoid movies with too much \"extreme\" content on any pole, but if there is any, I'll try to let you know! I strive to be an encouragement in your entertainment journey, with appropriate and moral content, and thoughts on the real life significance of the entertainment.", "The Secret Kingdom (1998):", "This is a pretty fun movie for anyone with a great imagination. I personally enjoyed it quite a lot. This movie left me with a lot of unanswered questions, which I think was intentional to promote the sense of wonder. Though they didn't come out and say all the answers, I do think you can reasonably speculate on most of the answers, and they did give a clearly stated and positive ending to the story. Like who was the man in the beginning of the film giving chase to our lead boy Mark? Was he an out-of-time version of Mark? Or a citizen of Relkin that was displaced somehow? They did give a clue to this answer at the end that I may have missed initially.", "Something to keep in mind with this one is that it could be a little scary for younger kids. I myself am 25, and I found that some of the people of Relkin which inexplicably had flesh covering their eyes very frightening and internally unsettling. My guess is that these individuals had been altered for \"perfection's sake\" and that entailed covering their eyes to make them blind followers and whistle-blowers for some reason. Regardless, I know if I was younger that might have REALLY bothered me. I know it's actually not a hard special effect to do, but it was a convincing and scary one!", "There's also some background screams when they go around the area where surgeries are supposedly done to \"perfect\" people, that actually turn them into semimindless performers of tasks.", "All that said, I think this serves to say they did a pretty good job, because it was truly compelling and frightening at moments!", "Messages For Real Life?", "Some positive takeaways from this would be creativeness and fun in fantasy. How cool would it be to find a kingdom under your kitchen sink? I could have a whole day of play with that as a kid!", "This is about the most meaningful moment of the film to me. Throughout the movie, the siblings can be quite rude to each other, but they do love each other in the end, and this is evident. It might be important to advise younger kids that calling other \"cockroach\" isn't nice or appropriate, but there is a sweet scene when the littlest boy is scared and goes to his sister in bed, and she is more sweet and honest in that moment than in most of the film... that moment really hit home for me. Sometimes it's that quiet moment in bed at the end of the day, especially as kids if you're in the same room, that the real emotional honesty and sweetness comes out.", "At the end of the movie they seem to be treating each other better, perhaps because they recognize the blessing of being home and having one another and being home in no significant danger.", "All in all, the kids aren't typically nice to each other in much of the movie, but this is kind of funny, as long as you know that it is inappropriate to treat your family members like that, and they are certainly not always mean. They are nice to each other at the end.", "But Really, Tell Me More.", "I think I would have really liked if the army men at the end of the film actually went into the kingdom of Relkin and became real warriors, although they seemed to somewhat parallel this idea without actually doing it.", "I don't remember any cursing in this movie except they keep calling the little brother \"cockroach\", which I found annoying because I hate that word and those things with a flaming terror!", "I liked how clear the ending was, even though there were some questions I had about the man at the beginning (and end) and the Relkin people with flesh-covered eyes.", "I also found it funny how the woman friend of Dr. Chartwell's seemed to have a constantly differing level of blouse coverage, although the camera rarely gives you the chance to notice, and it never sinks to any objectionable level, and her role is very minor. I'm sure there might be some funny production insight over that, although her outfit seems to be the kind that might just like to move around a little, so I'm not sure if that qualifies as inconsistency or realism.", "I think they did a really good job with what they had, it was a very convincing fantasy story. In all honesty it is amazing what they achieved with the likely budget they may have had. Sometimes you wish you could give a project like this just $10,000 more towards the end, because you KNOW they can actually put it to good use for hiring extras for a big battle or having visual effects added, things that make it even more spectacular, rather than just hiring another person for something and paying another salary like a lot of big movies seem to do by accident after a while.", "I rated 7/10 because I had some questions, wished for a thing or two that didn't happen and some of it was a little bit nightmare worthy for me.

Paul Thomas's otherwise laudable \"Sinderella\" starring the great Savannah (not Savanna Samson, her successor who also graced many a PT movie) fell into this trap and suffered for it.", "That's because the oft-told story of the stepsister who wins the Prince's favor at the ball leaving a glass slipper behind has a structure so familiar it is not amenable to the \"cut in half\" cliffhanger approach applied for Vivid release. Even its DVDs editions is out of print, and I was at first thrilled but ultimately quite disappointed with the overall result. (See my review of Part Two, which has an alternate title of just \"Stepsister\".)", "The opening reels of Part One (each half runs barely over an hour long, hardly justifying the split in two gimmick) are delightful, thanks to PT's witty dialog, amusing anachronisms and terrific acting by a well- chosen cast. Savannah is truly stunning to look at, her pristine beauty and innocent-seeming demeanor far removed from the hard-edged \"lived-in\" facade of today's numerous jail-bait, flat-chested petite stars(think Piper Perri or even Riley Reid).", "Britt Morgan, an actress who never got the Adult Industry recognition she deserved before migrating into behind-the-camera functions, is terrific as the Evil Stepmother, who Sinderella calls step-mommy dearest. Unusual for a Cinderella feature is casting arguably equal in stature if not bigger names than Cinderella as the step-sisters: Raquel Darian and P.J. Sparxx, both hot-hot-hot in their respective sex scenes.", "PT's jokey approach includes Randy West speaking in a very 20th Century colloquial manner as member of the court Rudy the Valet, with Joey Silvera much more appealing than usual in the role of his armorer Essex. Silvera has a pivotal male role, while PT rather wisely (for me) downplays the Prince to the level of almost a cameo status, and Randy Spears in that slot does not show up at all during Part One. The sets and costumes also done by PT himself are impressive.", "Lovely Melanie Moore takes the NonSex Role of the Fairy Godmother, and PT makes significant changes to the familiar tale, giving some useful emphasis to Sinderella's father essayed by Mike Horner, who is seemingly poisoned by his new wife Morgan. T.T. Boy is along for the ride briefly to hump Sindy outdoors in a Eden like opening scene.", "Part One ends with the folks arriving at the Prince's ball, and the good will and high hopes for a satisfying movie are dashed by the uneventful filler that constitutes Part Two."]},

This sex eats up precious running time, though die-hard fans of Raquel Darian and P.J.

It would have been wiser to preserve the witty narrator, like in some Woody Allen movies or in the recent \"Amelie\". This would be easy, given the book is already told in the first person.

This violent Western is set on dirty outdoors and dark interiors , the star is a mysterious revenger, ¨a man without name¨ , who comes to avenge against nasty villainous . It deals with an avenger named Davy Flanagan (Anthony Steffen), a war veteran and nowadays a Northern defector . Without memory , he gone back from a dark past to revenge his own death . He hasn't records and arrives in a small town , a location dominated by violent gangs and nasty gunfighters as Dirty (Mario Petri) . In that place there is a dangerous band led by a bandit called Crazy Joe (Fortunato Arena) and his hoodlums . There he meets a judge (William Berger) who tells him his unknown wife Liza (Ida Galli as Evelyn Stewart) is newly married a tough gunslinger named Clay Hackett (Robert Hundar) . Flanagan is wanted , as posters publicize : reward ¨10000 dollars , Dead or Alive¨ . As Davy being pursued and chased by bounty hunters , as he is detained but he get escaped .", "Offbeat Western follows the Sergio Leone wake , as it is proceeded in Spaghetti models . It's a moving western with breathtaking gunfight between the protagonist Anthony Steffen against the heartless Mario Petri and Fortunato Arena , in addition a stirring ending fight in the saloon and town square . This movie is a lot of fun to watch . It's an entertaining story with a touch of peculiarity , some great roles , and an amazing music score . The picture is a tale of justice and revenge , as a tough man seeks vendetta and his objective results to be a bloody revenge . The basic plot is typical spaghetti western fare , but what makes this movie stand out is its style . Steffen is appropriate in his usual character , he ravages the screen , shoots , hit and run and kills . The picture is well starred by Anthony Steffen . Acceptable action sequences with rousing attacks and spectacularly realistic battles . Charismatic performance for whole casting . The notorious Spaghetti actor , Anthony Steffen is good as Flanagan . Anthony Steffen may be a name best remembered by Spaghetti Western aficionados, but in his day, from the mid-'60s to the early '70s, Steffen was one of the most popular actors of the genre — at the time cheap B movies, now revered cult classics . The handsome, Italian-born — actually at the Brazilian embassy in Rome — Antonio Luiz de Teffè von Hoonholtz began working in films as a studio messenger for Vittorio De Sica . From there, Steffen began acting in sword-and-sandal epics, later moving onto the Western genre , where he found his niche . Unlike fellow Spaghetti star Clint Eastwood, however, Steffen never became a top international box-office attraction .His acting is often accused of being wooden, but in many manners is ideally suited to playing the steely-faced gunslinger synonymous with the genre . His others successes include features as ¨Seven Dollars to Kill¨, ¨The last Mohican¨, ¨Train for Durango¨, ¨Gentleman Jo¨ , ¨Four dollars for Django¨, ¨Shango¨, ¨Arizona colt¨, ¨Apocalypse Joe¨ and several others . Although Steffen's performance in the movie is a bit wooden for the role of such an interesting character . There appears as secondaries the habitual in Italian Western and Peplum , such as Robert Hundar , Raf Baldassarre , Luis Barboo , Eleonora Vargas , Alberto Dell'Acqua , Jean Louis , among others .", "There is plenty of action in the movie , guaranteeing some shoot'em up or stunts every few minutes . There is a very odd implementation of shots in the camera work during some particular scenes as the film approaches its climax , such as in the final gunfights . The movie gets the usual Western issues , as avengers antiheroes , violent facing off , exaggerated baddies and spectacular duels , excessive zooms , among them . Good production design creating an atmospheric but poor scenario , and fine though rotten sets . The musician Robby Poitevin composes a nice soundtrack in Morricole style and well conducted , this turns out to be one of the most memorable parts of the movie; as it's full of enjoyable sounds and haunting musical background . The soundtrack contributes tremendously to the atmosphere of the film, including an emotive leitmotif, the music score is perhaps the best part of this film . Striking cinematography by Enzo Barboni ; however , being necessary a correct remastering .", "Mario Caiano's direction is well crafted, here he's less cynical and humorous and more inclined toward violence and packs too much action , but especially this thrilling Western contains long shot'em up and violence . He directed this decent western , genre in which he would not only excel but one where he would spent much of the rest of his career , as he directed several Spaghetti : ¨Brandy¨, ¨Avenger of California¨ , ¨Ringo, face of revenge¨ , ¨Bullets don't argue¨, ¨Lone and angry man¨, ¨A train to Durango¨. Caiano is a craftsman who has directed all kind of genres as Peplum as ¨Ulisse vs Ercole¨, ¨I due Gladiatori¨, ¨Maciste Gadiatori di Sparta¨ and Terror : ¨Nightmare castle¨, ¨ Eye in the labyrinth¨ and even Pornonazi as ¨Nazi love camp 27¨. Although Caiano couldn't be deemed an \"A\"-list director, his movies had a professionalism and a verve that many of those made by his fellow B directors lacked . This is a passable though muddle and uneven Western but will appeal to Spaghetti aficionados . Rating : 6 , riotous Western in which there's too much violence , action and enough excitement"]},

Moving on from her clothes, she soon moves on from them herself via Jesse Eastern's hypnotic stare, made clear for us by jungle drums every time he takes off his sunglasses. An adequate enough threesome starts with Eastern, Cameo, and Jammer, as Jammer talks and talks about all the things Eastern could do with those glasses. This makes you think you might get some sort of wacky teamup between the men as they climb up the power ladder...which does not happen. The glasses exist just to teach women to be more horny for their be-mulleted men.", "We get three interconnected scenes showing the consequences of Eastern's powers, the grimiest being when he transforms Jennifer Stewart into a sex-obsessed wife for Jeff James. Everything about James' aura in this movie gives off skeevy enough vibes to where you wouldn't be averse to thinking David Lynch missed an opportunity not casting James as another of Laura Palmer's underworld connections. This scene and the following lesbian encounter between Stewart and Racquel Darrian are further overshadowed by the director's voice repeatedly popping up on the soundtrack. The other constant in all these scenes is a score which sounds like it was taken by - or from - the Prevue Channel.", "The fourth scene, with Darrian and hard up husband Derek Lane, has a very funny (intentionally or not) twist, enough to where this really should have been the end, but for some reason we get a completely disconnected closer with Eastern and Jacqueline which would have made more sense as taking place right after the plane sequence.", "Of course, nobody was watching this film for artistic reasons, but since they did choose to weave in a story element, a few quick changes could have helped. As it is, you get a mostly forgettable, jumbled experience."]},

Apparently IMDb got things mixed up here, and they're displaying the \"Tokyo: The Last Megalopolis\" cover in the section for \"Teito Taisen\" (\"Tokyo: The Last War\"), which is the official sequel to the aforementioned movie. Somebody needs to fix this quick! Right now, I'm reviewing \"Tokyo: The Last War\", not \"Last Megalopolis\". ", "Alright, I admit that this film has not been subtitled, and I don't understand Japanese. So how do I know what's going on in here? Repeated viewings and lots of translated summaries. However, even if you don't know Japanese, this film has just enough action and scenery to make it worthwhile.", "The story starts out at the end of World War II. Tokyo lies in ruins due to repeated fire-bombings from the American army. However, one surviving magic-user brings together a new group of mystics. His plan is to \"turn defeat into victory\" by using spiritual psychic powers to assassinate the evil world leaders from a distance (I know Hitler's involved). Unfortunately, the surge of spiritual energy along with the repeated horror of all those who endured the nightmare of the fire-bombings, rouses up all the souls of the dead, whose resentment and anger come together and revive...Yasunori Kato. Now it's up to a young apprentice of the psychic magic user to stop Kato before the evil sorcerer ruins their plans for victory. Kato also seems intent on torturing and gaining revenge on Yukiko (his \"daughter\" from the previous story), whose all grown-up now and works as a nurse in a hospital.", "It should be noted that this is the only film that I've seen that Takagise Ichise (the producer of \"Ringu\", \"Ju-On\", and \"Dark Water\") directed, and it definitely shows in the style. \"Tokyo: The Last Megalopolis\" was going for an exotic fantasy atmosphere, while this movie aims to be more of a dark and gory horror movie. The silly creatures that Kato summoned in the original film have been completely dumped here. The only magic he really uses in this movie is throwing stuff around with psychic energy like Darth Vader. He even acts differently, coming off more like a slow-moving and leering \"Terminator\" rather than the more dynamic way he was portrayed in the original. Strangely enough, the sets aren't as varied as they were in \"Last Megalopolis\" either. Everything's dark and brooding, putting a greater emphasis on the grim historical setting. The beginning of the film felt like a docudrama or just some historical war movie. It's not until Kato arrives that the film begins to explore it's fantasy roots more.", "I liked this movie. The story is easily more comprehensible than its predecessors, the characters are better defined, and the production just feels more taut this time around. But I can only enjoy it as a standalone production. When viewed as a sequel to \"Last Megalopolis\", it's an incredible disappointment. \"Tokyo: The Last Megalopolis\" was a very unique production in that it was a genre bender of a film: an epic that was equal parts fantasy, horror and historical fiction. This film feels more like some commercial horror film in a historical setting. It didn't even try to follow up the promises of its predecessor (for example, many plot threads left hanging at the end of that film are not resolved here). From an entertainment perspective, it's decent, but not in the same way.", "Two years later, Rintaro would take the story of \"Last Megalopolis\" and the dark atmosphere of this film and make the anime \"Doomed Megalopolis\". Ironically, since the atmosphere between the latter production and \"Last War\" is more consistent, \"Last War\" serves as a better sequel to the anime than \"Last Megalopolis\"."]},

They both devour her and you can sense just how much enjoyment Racquel is receiving from these two older pros. Both gals are bigger then tiny Racquel, so there's definitely a feeling of lesbian domination here. Racquel looks absolutely incredible in this scene as she allows her two lovers to eat her out, kiss, touch and explore without restriction. Racquel also does a beautiful job of enthusiastically going down on Christy, who is very hairy! There is also a later scene in which Racquel and Christy make love and Racquel drills her gal with a strap-on.

There's Tripod, the resident athlete dalmatian pup, he has only has three legs and is a positive \"handicapped\" character.  Patch is designed after his character in the book (he's supposed to be large).  Pongo and Perdy are much like their characters in the original animated movie.  Lucky's nemesis Mooch the Mutt is like all the jerks you knew in school.  Two-Tone is really cute (she even has a pierced ear).  Roger and Anita are written like their characters in the live-action movie, they were much more involving in that film.  Of course, Cruella DeVil is now their neighbor, constantly scheming to take over Dearly Farm.  Even Cruella can now have funny moments.  The one-shot characters are also charming and likable (a popular example is Lucky's friend Blaze the German Shepard pup from \"Dog's Best Friend\").  The only character I just don't like is Lt. Pug.  He feels rather tacked on, and the show never benefits from him: just a weak link.", "I personally like the modern theme (I really just don't need a \"That '60s Show\"), and the American setting (evidence is through American flags in many places, cars driving on the right-hand side of the road, American Southerners, etc).  It makes the characters more relatable, and the little truths the main pups discover in their lives lend a Simpson-esque feel. The focus on these modern-day puppies reminds me of \"Tiny Toon Adventures\" (another show I loved and still love. ^_^)", "So, yes, I love this show.  I believe it is better than the movies.  It's just too good.  Giving this show a chance on Toon Disney, I'm glad I took the time to see it.  If the guys at Disney are listening, I'd just love to see more of this show.  I'll recommend it to anyone.  When the good points can override the flaws easily, and can even outdo a favorite film from my childhood, how can I refuse?  Of course, you can't go wrong with so many cute puppies.", "It receives an enthusiastic 101/10."]},

The dialogue is so banal that I can't see how even the cast members believe any of this junk. And the lines are not unintentionally hilarious enough to inspire a chuckle in a cynic like me.

In addition, there are lots of midgets (for no particular reason). The total picture comes off like a tornado and it leaves you exhausted!

Playing the field was made in 1998 and was a programme to all those football fans out there. If you like Playing the field, then i am sure you will like another fantastic programme called Footballer's wifes. I gvie this programme 10 out of 10."]},

Therefore the special effects nearly all involved stopping the camera while the actors tried to remain in positions and placing something or someone in or out of frame. One person who was always on the receiving end of the mayhem was simply referred to as 'het Heertje', the most neurotic little worrier in town.

At the end of an episode there would be some sort of cliffhanger, but Tika or her father would reassure the audience that everything would turn out fine if they tuned in tomorrow. The magic users were the only characters who were allowed to speak to the camera. Later these serials were combined into 30 minuted episodes with mixed results. The editing often resulted in awkward jumps, and the repetitive nature of the stories became all the more apparent.", "In the second series the concept of a Grobbedal (valley) beneath the magic castle was added. It all became more of a trip and much more colourful, including Tika's costume. Many new magical characters appeared, pushing the leads to the background. In fact Tika's main function now became to get others out of trouble while her Toverpa remained largely off screen (so he could pay better attention to directing).

", "Whenever she did appear, Tika would try to get Kwark to join her for a ride on her broomstick, but since he was played by an English choreographer, he turned out to be more interested in men in real life and the actress who played Tika wound up with the actor who played her grandfather. Tato toveraap was replaced by Titi (sounds a bit rude) and the Grobbebollen got to fly around in their own little airplane.

The theme music is nothing special, very typical of Japanese shows of the time, but the background music is good and supports the story.

Considered that Carandiru was still an active prison back in the early 1980's that means Maia appears with several real inmates, some of them who might have been victims of the 1992 massacre that claimed the lives of 111 prisoners shot by the police during an invasion after a rebellion. The prison massacre story is told in the film ", ".", "When Antônio walks out of the bar along with the drunk man the shadow of a boom mic can be seen twice on the wall at the top of Antônio's head.", "Eduardo Escorel's film \"Ato de Violência\" (\"Act of Violence\") is a quite strange film with an intriguing premise that challenges viewers with its\nquestionings related to forgiveness, redemption and salvation of a tortured man. The man in question is Antônio (Nuno Leal Maia), a serial killer who is sentenced to\nmore than 30 years in prison after the brutal murder of a prostitute, a crime he doesn't even remember of commiting but all leads point back at him. He really killed that\nwoman, and severed her body trying to hide the corpse.", "He doesn't accept the fact of being in prison for a crime he doesn't have any recollection and already saddened with the fact his mother's health is declining and\nshe's all alone in the world. Come to his aide the assistance from a young woman (Selma Egrei) of whom he was about to get married when he was arrested and for some odd\nreason she believes that he isn't the monster people tell that he is and she still wants to marry him, helping the man to get a decent lawyer who can find a way to reduce\nhis sentence. Thanks to his good behavior behind bars, he's released on probation and gets to marry the girl. And that's when the challenge begins: how will Antônio live his\nlife as an ex-convict trying to find a job, support his wife and stay away from temptations such as spending the night on bars, drinking away, chasing prostitutes and all?", "Deep down inside, as revealed by the many psychiatrists who take his case inside the prison the man has several mental problems, and there is a hidden killer instict inside\nof him that somehow always manages to get out.", "Escorel defies us in thinking about the possibilities of redemption for such a man. Antônio is indeed presented as a nice guy, hard worker, with some good\nacquaintances of whom try to stay away from him after his past as an ex-convict and we can see and sense that he's really working hard for a change even though society isn't\nall that welcome to him. And that's when he goes back to his lazy days doing nothing but occupying space. That's when the devil comes for him and he doesn't even try to\nstruggle against it.", "Despite the suspense built in its story (as it has to be one, after all), this film is more concerned in presenting us the drama of Antônio and the way he tries to\nlive and survive with the circumstances brought on him and the things he does of which he doesn't take full responsibility. The eternal ladies man Maia plays one of his best\nroles to date, a very conflicted character of whom, despite the terrible and tragic acts he does, there's something about his quiet nature and the way he interacts with\npeople that he becomes a very likeable guy. He's not your typical serial killer clouded with intelligence and wit, but he can be cruel, vicious, brutal and soulless as\nevidenced in the murders he commits.", "I was surprised this film didn't have a review until now, maybe there was one that got deleted because I don't usually miss the chance to analyze it when no one else\nhad done before. Or maybe I was lacking in inspiration to say something about it, and because of the zero review status here I rewatched it (since I had forgotten plenty of\nthings except for the final scene) and was inclined to write about it. This second viewing didn't improve its rating but it certainly got a lot more memorable than it was,\nand I could find a deeper meaning to its premise.", "You will finish watching this and asking yourself if true redemption and true salvation can exist; you can question about how prison can change a man (in fact,\nAntônio is a lucky man because we don't see any involvement of his in fights, breakouts or rebellions - maybe that's a flaw of the script in not giving us a wider dimension\nof facts that could change the man's behavior); and we can question if one the past is left behind, you're settled with someone and leading a new life can in fact change you\nfor good or you may relapse into dangerous habits that can only bring the worst out of you. The movie gives us a straight, honest and real answer to those questions, but for\na long time in Antônio's journey we wondered, we cheered for him and we hoped that things could turn out different for him. But there's always something in the way, deep down in a part we cannot touch. 8/10."]},

There are volumes spoken in a look or a gesture and more steam is skillfully generated in this manner than through the dialog or the sex scenes. The progression of the illicit affair changes all of the participants in unforeseen and unexpected ways...sometimes eliciting strains of sadism, self-pity, mental cruelty and blind carnal lust. The film is a fascinating study of adultery and ultimately an indictment of giving the passions free rein...risking ruin. Recommended for mature and sophisticated viewers."]},

Burt Ward, Dana Plato, and especially Erin Moran have a field-day lampooning themselves, and their bits are short but memorable.  Director Greg Glienna uses small moments to make a bigger over-all impression, like a killer Girl Scout horror movie scene, or former child stars playing poker together, or even a particularly hysterical, yet tiny, bit with a waiter whom Judy's desperate character thinks is an autograph seeker. Their facial expressions alone induce out-loud laughs. Moments like these make up a movie that should be seen by everyone who enjoys well-nuanced and intelligent comedy."]},

Unfortunately, just when he is in the center of a major project one of his clients murders a prostitute and he is called upon to do something beyond which he has never done before-and this is when his problems really begin. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a surprisingly good made-for-television film which had a decent plot and some interesting twists and turns along the way. And although I am not a big fan of Jon Voight he performed quite well as did Brenda Baake (as his wife \"C.J.\").

They differ in that not only is the US version dubbed in English, but the title and credits are in English as well. I have read elsewhere that the \"Hermann der Cherusker...\" titled version is actually a compilation of this and another film, \"In the Shadow of the Eagles.\" But I digress...", "Cameron Mitchell does not play the part of Arminius as the prior commenter states. That part is played by Hans von Barsody. Cameron Mitchell plays the Roman Consul Sessina...and he broods his way through from beginning to end. Maybe the attitude was borne of being stuck making films in Italy.", "The production tries very hard to be epic and huge, but...no. Yes, there are lots of guys riding around on horses, and some of these scenes look big. But much of the soundtrack reminds one of an episode of Aesop's Fables (or is that Fractured Fairy Tales?) from the Rocky and Bullwinkle Show. And while the story of Arminius' massacre involved the slaughter of thousands of Roman soldiers, the actual depiction of that battle here in the flick doesn't seem to involve more than a couple dozen guys at best.", "Still, anyone who knows the tale of Arminius will get a kick out of this film...if you can lay your hands on it. I rate the film a 7 just because it exists. If I were intellectually honest, it's closer to a 3-4."]},

While Connor, Duncan and even Kate's party are aware that the \"King's decree\" is a fake, it seems strange that no one mentions the most obvious proof of this: the reigning monarch in 1712 was Queen Anne.", "The original theatrical cut has been issued on DVD in Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Norway and Germany. It is also included as a bonus DVD on the Dutch DVD release incorrectly labeled as \"Earlier full-length cut 100 min.\"", "Featured in ", " (2004)", "Lets be fair.  This is not Highlander 4, it's the capstone movie to Highlander the Series.  The Series has only the name, and the overall plot concepts in common with the original movie, and the others.  There really should be no continuity comparisons between this movie and the others, as it follows them only in name, not in story.", "The series is it's own storyline, always was. It changed many of the 'established facts' of the original movie to better suit a long running series, rather than a 2 hr film.  More or less, the original movie was set late in the 'game', when there were only a handful of the immortals left. The Gathering was near.  In the series, the gathering isn't nearing, it's more of a legend.  The number of immortals is large (Duncan does quite a bit of thinning, but still there are more), and new ones are being created all the time.  This 'game' may run forever.  This idea is well suited for a series, something that can last for many many many episodes.  You can't string the audience along with 6 immortals for 8 seasons, it would be boring.", "Taking the film for what it is, it's all right.  I wasn't overly impressed, but it wasn't as annoying or repulsive as 2 and 3.  Duncan was a more important character than Connor in the series.  Connor was mainly there to introduce the series, and give the pilot a boost.  He was really a minor character.  In the series, immortals had very complex relationships, and sometimes working together for years. This was in the first movie, but in a more guarded, limited capacity.  Ramirez implied he was going to move on once Connor was ready to make his own in the world, and Castagir hadn't seen Connor in 100 years, it being 200 years since they spent any time together. Not as chummy, but not 100% cold shoulder either.", "The film works hard to explain differences in the life of Connor from first movie to series/last movie, doing a pretty good job, it does seem rushed, and a little contrived, but it worked. Like most Sci-Fi/Fantasy stories, the more they try to explain 'how things work' the deeper and deeper they dig themselves into a hole.  This creates one of the silliest or most confusion elements of the story: transference of Quickening. Which annoyed many viewers.", "Overall, for a fan of the series, this should be an enjoyable film. For fans of the original film, it may be disappointing. Personally, I am holding out for a movie version of a rumored screenplay: a biopic of Juan Sanchez Villalobos Ramirez, that Spanish Peacock!!! (Maybe Connery can be talked into it, but I won't hold my breath)"]},

He starts out seasick, and things go from bad to worse for him when senior Midshipman Simpson targets him for abuse until Horatio becomes suicidally-minded, and when Simpson accuses him of cheating at cards, Hornblower challenges him to a duel. But Clayton knocks Hornblower out, takes his place in the duel, and is shot. Before Horatio can do anything, war is declared, and he is transferred to the Indefatigable under Captain Pellew.

But when Simpson reappears, and Horatio is given a dangerous assignment with Simpson at his back, will he survive?", "The film opens with seventeen-year-old Midshipman Horatio Hornblower (Ioan Gruffudd) coming aboard the HMS Justinian He is greeted by fifteen-year-old Midshipman Archie Kennedy (Jamie Bamber) and is introduced to Lieutenant Eccleston (Robert Bathurst) and Lieutenant Chadd (Roger May) who both welcome him aboard. Eccleston orders that Kennedy take Hornblower to the midshipman corner, and Kennedy does so. However, the midshipman's welcome is not as warm as that of Eccleston, Chadd, and Kennedy. Midshipman Cleveland (Frank Boyce) and Midshipman Hether (Richard Lumsden) are VERY rude to the younger midshipman. However, Midshipman Clayton (Duncan Bell) pays them no mind and asks Hornblower how old he is. Hornblower says he is seventeen, Hether automatically taunts this fact and says he highly doubts he knows the difference between \"a hat and a hanging\" and Hornblower says he doesn't, but he'll be sure it's the first thing he looks up. Clayton finds this funny, Hornblower excuses himself and suffers a spell of seasickness. Clayton gets him into a hammock and strips of his overcoat, throwing a blanket over Hornblower's weak body. Hornblower begs his pardon, Clayton assures him and tells him to lie quiet until he feels himself again. Hornblower falls asleep after a horrible first day.", "Hornblower wakes a bit later than expected the next morning, much to Eccleston's notice. Kennedy whispers to Hornblower that \"the captain is coming aboard\" and Clayton remarks that if ever a man was wrongly named it would most defintely be Captain Keene, due to his frail appearance. Hornblower whispers his gratitude to...Clayton who tells the young Midshipman that he should not mind Hether and Cleveland, that it is only their way and they'll get use to him. At that moment, the whistle blows and Captain Keene (Michael Byrne) is welcomed aboard. He calls Hornblower to his cabin and tells him that he was good friends with his father and asks about his health, Hornblower tells him that he is well enough. Keene laughs at the fact that \"a son of a doctor\" is surviving in the British navy, he asks Hornblower about his schooling and the only fact that Hornblower can offer is that he was a Grecian (an expert in the Greek language). Keene tells him if he minds his duties and does as he is told that no harm will come to him, he dismisses Hornblower. The same night, the men are settling down for the night with wine and music. Clayton plays his fiddle as Hether tells Horatio about the Indys, and that it is surely the place to be with its \"clear blue skies and waters to\" Hornblower says he would love to see it, Cleveland says he may if they can get off the Justinina one day. The dreaming and smiles ends abruptly when a shadow appears, a voice scowls \"You are in my seat\" the figure whom steps out of the shadows is none other than bullying Midshipman Jack Simpson (Dorian Healy). One of the midshipman quickly gets up from his seat at the head of the table, Simpson takes it for him. Simpson asks why nobdoy cheered for his return, Cleveland says that they never thought he would return. Simpson seems slightly offended by this comment. Hether asks Simpson about his comission, Simpson simply tells him it was \"refused.\" Hether says it was probably bad luck, Simpson says it was indeed bad luck and that due to this Lieutenant Jack Simpson is now lowly Midshipman Jack Simpson as he remarks sarcastically that he is at their services. Simpson finally notices Hornblower and asks his name and rank, Hornblower tells him both. Simpson asks what is on his plate, Hornblower says it's only mutton and ale. Simpson helps himself to Hornblower's food and drink, Hornblower says he had no right to do so. Simpson asks him if that is really true, there is a moment of silence. Simpson quietly asks for Kennedy, whom does not respond at first. Simpson shouts his name which finally snaps the young Midshipman out of his comatose-like trance. Simpson asks him if he has told Hornblower the rules, Kennedy shakes his head no and proceeds to do so. Only one rule: Every midshipman is to be sure that all fresh-cut meat and all the warm blankets go to Simpson. Hornblower asks to why they must do that, Kennedy says it's because he is a Senior Midshipman. Hornblower says they are all only midshipman, Simpson begs to differ. Hornblower says that regulations clearly do not say anything about \"a senior midshipman\" Simpson drives a dagger through the table and says that he \"pisses on regulations!\" Hornblower is clearly frightened, Simpson is right at his face when he tells him that this clearly a case of Mark Antony rendering unto Ceaser and he will leave Hornblower to decide who Caeser and who is to do the rendering. Clayton dives in to defend his friend and tells Simpson that Hornblower understands his meaning. Simpson backs off Hornblower and turns to Clayton, asking him to play a merry tune on his fiddle. Obviously afraid, Clayton obeys him. Simpson turns to Hornblower and tells him to \"cut them a rug\" Hornblower is still, Simpson orders again and Hornblower remains mum. By the third warning, Simpson has control of his temper yet again and Hornblower can no longer disobey. He stands to his feet and dances an Irish jig, after all that Simpson can only taunt Hornblower's horrible footing. Simpson turns to a deeply distracted Kennedy, and tells him that he will wake Hornblower every half hour in order to teach him a lesson. As night falls, all is calm and still until Kennedy suddenly has an uncontrollable seizure. Hornblower notices it and is instantly concerned, Simpson orders for Kennedy to shut up. Hornblower says he can't and tells Simpson that he is sick, Simpson could care less he only wants quiet. Hornblower kneels down to the floor and tries to calm Kennedy, Clayton joins him and says that it has started again and he had feared this would happen. Simpson tells Clayton that if Kennedy is unfit then he will take his duties in waking Hornblower, Clayton sorely agrees to the orders. Clayton and Hornblower move Kennedy back into his hammock, Clayton settles Kennedy until he is asleep once more, Clayton tells Kennedy that it was only a bad dream. Hornblower asks what ails him, Clayton turns to Horatio and shrugs \"What ails us all.\" Throughout the night, Hornblower is awaken every half-hour just as Simpson instructed. It is a very sleepless night for the young man.", "The next morning, Hornblower steps onto a very wet deck and almost slips but thankfully catches himself. Out of nowhere, Seaman Styles (Sean Gilder) climbs down from the watchtower and tells Hornblower that Lieutenant Eccleston wants to see him up at the watchtower, Hornblower asks him if he is sure and Styles say he is. Hornblower begins to climb up to the watchtower, as Styles watches down below with a cheeky grin. Suddenly, Hornblower's foot slips and he is left clinging onto the net absolutely petrified. It really was a trick, Simpson smiles and climbs down from the watchtower. Hornblower begs for his help, Simpson (while a coldhearted scoundrel) decides to help him down. Later in the day, the Midshipmen (save Clayton) are being tutored in ways of directions and equations. Captain Keene checks Simpson's work first, and chuckles as he sarcastically remarks \"We must all rejoice. The sources of the Nile have been discovered at last.\"What Keene can tell from Simpson's illerate scroll is that his ship is somewhere in Africa, Keene walks away from him obviously very dissapointed. Keene fails Cleveland, Hether, and Kennedy but not Hornblower who he describes as alone \"amongst these intellectual giants\" Keene orders Master Bowles (Colin MacLachlan) to be sure that Simpson pays further attention to his studies, he dismisses the midshipmen and walks away. Simpson watches Hornblower with a very displeasing look. Later that night, all seems calm and still even as Simpson enters the scene. Simpson says to Cleveland, Hether, and Kennedy that it is about time that they show the new Midshipmen the ropes, Simpson is ignored. Simpson there is no other candidate but Hornblower, he orders for Hether and Cleveland to clear off the table. Cleveland tries to protest, Simpson yells that they better do it or they WILL take his place. Hether and Cleveland quickly clean off the table, they force Hornblower onto it and hold him down. Simpson orders for a younger Midshipman to keep quiet, Simpson takes out rope and uses to strike Horatio's hide. Simpson tells Hornblower that he is a bit of dark horse for showing them up in front of Keene, he orders for Cleveland and Hether to turn Hornblower onto his back, they proceed to do so while Kennedy simply tunes the torture out and Clayton watches on helplessly. Simpson presses his body against Hornblower's, telling him that the purpose of this certain inquistion is for him to get to know him a bit better, he tells Hornblower that he knows all the Midshipmen and knows what knaws at their souls every night, he asks Hornblower what his dirty little secret is. He mockingly guesses that he is probably a homosexual (\"fancier of other boys,perhaps\") he snatches a locket off of Hornblower's neck and chuckles, he then asks if Hornblower's mother makes a living on her back. Hornblower is instantly offended and headbutts Simpson, only to have the older midshipman continously beat his head against the table and his body shoved to the floor. Simpson orders that he gets up, Hether tells Simpson that he has won and orders him to stop. Simpson continues to kick Hornblower repeatedelly, Cleveland pleads for him to stop or he will surely kill him. Simpson finally stops, Cleveland orders for Hornblower to stay down but the determined young man stands to his feet. Simpson punches him and continues to beat on the helpless Hornblower, out of nowhere a pistol is held to Simpson's head. It is Clayton's pistol, Clayton orders for Simpson to \"stand off\" Simpson nervously states that he has no quarrel with Clayton. Clayton again warns him to \"stand off\" or he will trim the wall with his brains, Simpson lays off Hornblower. Clayton orders for the Midshipmen to take Hornblower to Doctor Hepplewhite, they quickly proceed to do so. After they leave, Simpson tells Clayton how bold he is with a pistol in hand. Simpson whacks the weapon out of Clayton's hand, Clayton backs away. Simpson tells Clayton that he knows him for the coward that he really is, he tightens a rope around his knuckles. A sure sign that like Hornblower, Clayton suffered some form of abuse that same night.", "The next morning, Eccleston is searching for Hornblower when he finally finds him. He is obviously angry, he tells Hornblower that he gave him specfic orders before Eccleston can continue his outburst, Hornblower turns to his commander. Eccleston's anger instantly turns to concern when he see's just how brusied Hornblower's face is, Eccleston asks what happened. Hornblower lies and says he just lost his footing and fell down the stairs, Eccleston can clearly tell that it's a lie because all of his face is brusied. Eccleston asks him again, Hornblower is silent. Eccleston orders for him to tell him or he will deal with the situation in a more leninent manner, Hornblower again says that he only fell. Eccleston sighs, obviously given up, he tells Hornblower that he will see if a spell in the gratings can't teach him to tread more carefully. As Eccleston walks away, Simpson shoots Hornblower a most evil glare and walks away. As the rain pours, Hornblower is tied to a net in a crucifixion manner, in a voiceover when he hear him write a letter to his father. He tells him that he is truly happy in the letter. Which is clearly not true.", "The next day after the skies have cleared, Clayton approaches an emotionless Hornblower and offers him a mug of ale (with just a drop of grog), Hornblower is not responding. Clayton calls out to him, Hornblower can only say \"death\" Clayton is terribly confused. Hornblower tells Clayton that he was thinking on death, Clayton sighs and asks whose death he was thinking on, Hornblower says he was thinking on his own. Clayton suggests that Hornblower desert, Hornblower says even if he were to do that he would not be free and that would give Simpson victory and THAT would surely be worse than death. Hornblower suggests that somebody should stand against Simpson, Clayton warns that the beating that Simpson gave Hornblower was nothing in comparsion to the other terrible things that he is very well capable of. After finishing off his warning, Eccleston and Simpson approach the two. Eccleston tells them that Simpson is take to a party of men ashore and rendevou with Lieutenant Chalk of the HMS Golilath and he gives Hornblower the order to accompany them, Hornblower agrees. Simpson, Hornblower, and some other crewmembers of the Justinina meet up with Lieutenant Chalk (Oliver Montgomery) who asks whom Hornblower is. Simpson introduces him as Horatio Hornblower, or he is better known as the Midshipman who was seasick at Spithead. Chalk looks a bit relcutant to accept Hornblower after hearing this fact, he tells them that they are to keep watch until they come across their allies. A few hours later, it seems that Hornblower is the only one whom is keeping watch as Simpson is inside The Lamb Inn and having a drink, Hornblower steps inside. Simpson tells Hornblower to give a toast to someone, Hornblower quickly says to raise a glass to the King, Simpson only chuckles. Lieutenant Chalk arrives with one of his lieutenants, he tells them that while they wait for word if they would care to join him in a game of cards to pass the time. Both of the gentleman agree to do so. As the men play the card game Robber, Hornblower begins to swipe the winnings when Simpson tries to stop him but he still proceeds as he folds out his cards, saying that the rest are his. Simpson is confused. Chalk says that Hornblower had five tricks, he reminds Simpson that \"the game is Robber. \" Simpson is still confused, Hornblower says it is only a simple mathmetical caculation, Simpson mutters \"He knows the back of the cards as well as he knows the front.\" Hornblower hears him and calls the remark out as an insult, Chalk defends Simpson and says Simpson can probably explain. Hornblower tells Chalk that he was accused of cheating at cards and that's a very hard thing to explain, Chalk continues to defend and says that Simpson was simply speaking subconciously and requests that the order another bottle of wine and drink it in the vanity of friendship. Hornblower says he will do, and with the great pleasure, if Simpson apologizes to him and admits that he spoke out of terms. Simpson smirks \"Apologize to you? Never the sight of Hell.\" Hornblower asks Chalk and the fellow Lieutenant if they heard it for themselves, Simpson had just insulted Hornblower again and refused to apologize. Hornblower says that there is only way \"that satisfaction can be given\" now.", "\"A duel? Are you mad?!\" Kennedy exclaims, Hornblower is back on the Justinina and has just told Kennedy and Clayton about his plans to challenge Simpson to a duel. Hornblower clearly tells Kennedy that this duel will be the end of it, whether he wins or loses he will be rid of Simpson either way. He notes that he has a pretty even chance of winning. Kennedy argues in saying that Simpson is the best shot in the Navy and that he will Hornblower for sure, Hornblower and Kennedy turn to Clayton who has remained mum. Clayton tells Hornblower that he will act as his second, of course but he must know if Hornblower has \"fought a duel before.\" Kennedy turns to a silent Hornblower, it is pretty obvious that he has not fought in a duel beforehand. The next morning, Clayton stands on deck and takes a drink from his flask as the longboats pull out. Clayton see's a special tool and picks it up, he heads below deck and finds Hornblower bracing himself for the duel. Clayton asks if he is ready, Hornblower nods his head. Clayton sighs and draws a bit closer, he asks Hornblower if there is any way for him to change his mind, Hornblower shakes his head. Clayton sighs once more and asks for Hornblower to hand him his cloak, as Hornblower reaches for the wrapping he is knocked out cold by Clayton. In the woods, a carriage speeds to the sight of the duel. Two people step out of the carriage, Clayton and Kennedy. They approach Simpson, Hether, Cleveland and Doctor Hepplewhite (Simon Markey). Simpson asks where Hornblower is, Clayton tells Simpson that Hornblower has met with an \"accident\" and won't be able to fight in the duel. Simpson smirks in saying \"You mean the little coward has pissed himself?\" Clayton ignores the remark and tells them that his duties as Hornblower's second means he will stand proxy, Hepplewhite doesn't understand. Clayton tells him that he will fight in Hornblower's place, he says he won't however if Simpson chooses to remove his accusation against Hornblower, Simpson says he will never do that. Hepplewhite tells Clayton that this is most likely illegal, Clayton says whether it is legal or illegal that it would settle the matter and says that he is here and that Simpson is not afraid of him. Back on the Justinina, Hornblower regains concious and instantly knows what has happened, he races off. Back in the woods, Clayton and Simpson are about ten steps apart from each other and have their pistols in hand. Hepplewhite goes over the rules and asks the gentlemen if they are ready, Simpson and Clayton both say they are. Hepplewhite calls fire and both guns shoot off, Simpson is shot in the shoulder and falls to the ground bleeding. Clayton tells Simpson that he got him, not aware that he has blood coming from his own mouth. Clayton falls to his knees and collapses, blood is spouring from his gut. Moments later, Hornblower is seen racing towards The Lamb Inn through a snow-covered England. He hears shouts coming from inside and steps into the inn, he see's Hether and Cleveland patching up Simpson's shoulder so he is clearly not the one he heard yelling. Hornblower fears the worse. Cleveland points up stairs, Hornblower storms up the stairs and charges into an open room where he see's a bleeding Clayton and a very dismayed Kennedy and Hepplewhite. Hornblower goes to Clayton's bedside and takes his hand, Clayton apologizes for not killing Simpson, all of the sudden there are shouts from outside. Clayton asks what they are shouting about, Hornblower says he doesn't know and orders Kennedy to go outside and find out. Kennedy leaves the room, Hornblower sits on Clayton's bed and asks him the pretty obvious question: \"why?\" Clayton tells Hornblower that he was right, somebody needed to stand up to Simpson but it couldn't be a boy. Clayton lets out a cough as Hornblower frightfully looks to a sadden Hepplewhite for answers, Clayton continues in saying that Hornblower shamed him and that they could have cowered together and runned forever, Hornblower shakes his head. Clayton tells Hornblower that he actually thought he could beat Simpson, after all he had \"an even chance\" Hornblower and Clayton smile until Clayton finds himself unable to breathe, he tightens his grip on Hornblower's hand and asks the young Midshipman if it is evening. Within that moment, Clayton dies. An upset Hornblower heads for the exit of the inn when Simpson calls out to him, he remarks that he isn't finished with him and that he will flail Hornblower alive. Hornblower quickly steps outside and tries to gather his thoughts, Kennedy approaches him with a smile and says that he is dead. Hornblower says yes, Kennedy says he wasn't referring to Clayton he was referring to the fact that the French have murdered King Louis and that means only one thing: war is coming. The next morning aboard the Justinina, Cleveland and Hether are playing cards while Hornblower seems too be in deep shock and grief over the recent death of Clayton. Kennedy comes down to the Midshipmen's corner, Hether asks what is happening. Kennedy tells them that half the crew is to remain aboard the Justinina, Cleveland and Hether look dismay. Kennedy says, however, that the other half are to transfer. Hether orders Kennedy to tell who got the transfer, Kennedy says that Keene has reccommended their transferral to the HMS Indefatigable. Hether hits the ceiling (literally), while Cleveland tells Hornblower that it's a frigate and it will mean prize money, Hornblower is unresponsive. Kennedy tells them that Clayton always wanted to sail on a frigate. Later that night, Hornblower goes to Keene and tells him that he wishes to remain aboard the Justinina. Keene says, that while he respects Hornblower's loyalty, this is a terrific opportunity for him and that he will accept it whether he likes it or not, he dismisses Hornblower. The next morning, half of the crew (that includes all midshipmen) head for open waters and spot the goodship Indefatigable, Hornblower can't help but smile for the first time in days. When they reach the ship, there is a speech held by the ship's captain Sir Edward Pellew (Robert Lindsay) that ends with a loud \"God save the King!\" from all the crew, that includes Hornblower who has finally found himself able to speak since the loss of his friend.", "Hornblower is sent to Pellew's cabin, Pellew is looking over Hornblower's letter of recommendation and tells him that Simpson has recovered but will remain on board the Justinina with Keene, Pellew asks Hornblower if that upsets him but Hornblower isn't sure how to answer. Pellew hopes that Keene will now be a bit wiser and now will be able to notice just what is going on aboard his ship, Hornblower defends his former Captain's actions. Pellew tells Hornblower that's it's not his job to \"damn him nor defend him\" Hornblower agrees. Pellew tells Hornblower to remember that while a Captain is aboard his own ship, that nothing is out of his control and he will do well to remember that, Hornblower says he will. Pellew goes on in saying that he doesn't judge a man from actions, but his actions have already cost the Navy two men: one injured and one dead. Hornblower protests in saying that nobody mourns Clayton as much as he does, and that he resents that comment. Pellew fights back with a loud (and probably the famous quote from the series) \"Damn your impudence,sir!\" Hornblower is silent. Pellew gives Hornblower a comission, telling him to never fight another duel and Hornblower agrees to it. Pellew continues and asks Hornblower if he has the opportunity of meeting the seamen aboard the Justinina, Hornblower says he hasn't but he has met them. Pellew tells him that they are all in his charge due thanks to Simpson's injury. Hornblower calls the seamen in for the role call afterwards, their names are as followed, Stevens, Williams, Oldroyd (Simon Sherlock), Matthews (Paul Copley), Finch (Christopher Barnes), and a white-flake-face Styles (whom we've already seen). Hornblower asks Styles what happened to his face, Finch is about to say something but Matthews nudges him as if he is saying for him to stop. Styles says it is only boils, Hornblower asks if he has done anything about them and Styles say he has. Hornblower wishes to know what he has done, Styles says he puts plaster on them. Oldroyd suddenly begins to laugh, Hornblower tells Styles that he and the others will obey him or they will suffer the consquences of disobedience, Hornblower snaps his head and asks Oldroyd what is so funny and Oldroyd says nothing. Hornblower asks Styles if he understands, Styles says he does. As Hornblower walks away, Styles whacks Finch's hat off his head as punishment for almost telling their secret. Suspecting their is something afoul amongst his new crew, Hornblower steps below deck later in the day to investigate, what he discovers is the seamen gambling and they are using rats as the dice, trying to kill them with everything but their hands. Which means that Styles was bitten and did not have boils like he said. Oldroyd says Styles' final count is five, Styles argues that it was six. Oldroyd protests, Styles says that the sixth rat is dead and waves him in front of Oldroyd's face to prove it. Matthews tries to step in between the argument, which almost leads to a fight between the men until Hornblower finally makes his presence known. Hornblower is solemn in expression as he tells the men that he expected more from the likes of them, Styles says they aren't on duty and Hornblower says that they are gambling which is clearly worse. Hornblower asks them if they know the consquences for gambling: they could be condemned or flogged or possibly worse. Styles gives him a foul stare, Hornblower tells him that if he gets one more look like that then he WILL go to Eccleston. Matthews orders for Styles to quit, Styles looks away from Hornblower. Matthews says to Hornblower that Simpson allowed this to happen, Hornblower tells him that Simpson is no longer in charge of them that he is and he wants to see them all on deck front and center. Styles is about to protest, when Hornblower shouts: \"I'VE SAID IT AND I MEAN IT\" Styles and the others are silent. Hornblower says he wants them all on deck, Matthews (or Styles) asks Hornblower if he is going to go to Lieutenant Eccleston, Hornblower says no because he will give them one last chance to earn his trust but if they do disobey him again then he will, he asks if he is clear and the men agree that he is. Hornblower tells Styles to replaster his face, for Matthews to get rid of the rats, he seems as he is about to order Oldroyd when he simply tells him that the final count was indeed six. Kennedy suddenly comes below deck and orders for the men to head for quarters, there is battle going on! The drums sound as Eccleston, Chadd, Kennedy, and Hornblower move alongside the cannons. They each call for the cannons to fire, they go off and the French simply fight back by letting off one large cannon which kills a few of the men aboard the Indefatigable, Williams has had his leg severed. Hornblower goes to him and orders for Styles to help move him down below, the two carry Williams off and take him below where they lay him on a table. Hornblower, who is getting cleaned up because of a terrible injury to the eye, orders for Hepplewhite to take care of Williams but Hepplewhite is busy removing a stencil from Chadd's arm. Hornblower tells Hepplewhite that if he doesn't do something now that Williams will surely bleed to death, Chadd is about to protest when Williams begins yelling. Chadd tells Hepplewhite to treat Williams, he can wait and Hepplewhite proceeds to do so. Styles and Hornblower return to deck when they realize that the Indefatigable has already won victory, Kennedy races up to Hornblower and tells him that they carried her by boarding and that he killed at least two men, Kennedy tells Hornblower that he should've been there. Hornblower once again finds his mind thinking on the loss of his dear friend, Clayton. Only a few hours later, do we learn that Hornblower's efforts were useless as see a funeral being held for only one man: Davy Williams. After Williams' body is condemned to sea, Styles thanks Hornblower for at least trying to save his friend's life and Hornblower tells him to tell the others that they are welcome. Styles salutes him and walks away, Hornblower says that a salute is a start. But it will take awhile before the seamen can trust him and he them.", "Later in the week, the Indefatigable comes across a French convoy. Eccleston, who we learn speaks French, tells them that it is indeed a French ship carrying supplies. After the ship is captured, Eccleston proceeds to tell Pellew that there is another French ship, the Marie Gallante, which needs to be under their command. Pellew orders Hornblower to take his men and take command of the Gallante, Kennedy congraluates Hornblower on his first command ever. Hornblower, Styles, Oldroyd, Finch, Matthews, and Stevens climb aboard The Marie Gallante, all they see is a very drunk crew and the stubborn Captain Forget (Vincent Grass). Forget says that he is already wanted in London and he refuses to return to a place where he will very hang, Hornblower says no matter what Forget says he will be sent back to London and he will be hanged, Hornblower orders Styles to stop drinking. Hornblower tells Oldroyd to take Forget's crew down below, Hornblower asks Matthews if he has been at seas the longest, Matthews proudly says he has served for 13 years. Hornblower appoints him as his first mate and orders for them to set sail, Matthews and Styles are not moving. Hornblower asks them what they are waiting for, those were his orders. Matthews suggests that they should put Forget's crew to work as well, Hornblower smiles and says that was his intention. Hornblower warns Matthews that since they are drunk they might refuse, Matthews assures that they can get them to work drunk or sober. A few days later, Hornblower steps into his cabin and something about his compass causes him to mutter a colorful vocabulary. He dozes off and dreams about a dreadful fate for Pellew, when he wakes up he discovers there's a problem. There is a hole in the ship, Hornblower dives in and tries to seal the hole off with netting. It works, for the time being. However, there's another problem arising. There is way too much rice on the ship, everybody knows in order to the survive that they must call \"abandon ship\" and Hornblower agrees. Hornblower is the last one into the rowboat as he gathers his compass and maps, every watches with heavy hearts as the Marie Gallante is condemend to the ocean depths.", "So now it's Hornblower & his men, and Forget & his men all in one rowboat. Forget's men are doing all the work, which displeases the French captain. Forget walks over to Hornblower, trying to get a good look at the compass. Hornblower quickly closes it, Forget argues with him and finally holds Hornblower at gunpoint, demmanding the charts & compass. Hornblower hands him the charts with no problem, but things get really heated when Hornblower deliberately tosses the compass overboard and suggests that Forget \"fish for it.\" Forget slaps Hornblower, Styles whips out his gun and is ready to shoot. Hornblower orders that Styles lowers his gun, and he does. Forget keeps a solemn face \"That was a foolish thing to do, boy. I might have killed you.\" Hornblower smiles as he wipes his lips dry of the blood and responds \"And forgo the pleasure of crowing at my discomfort? I think not.\" Hornblower & his men are now at the mercy of Forget, as they continue on their journey. One day, Finch is serving some water to all of the men when he accidentally trips and angers Forget. Forget's men hold Finch as they are about to execute him, Hornblower and the others take out their pistols and Forget argues for them to put them away and so they do and Finch is released. As night falls, Hornblower is awake when he see's the moon dissapearing behind the clouds and with a smile, he falls back asleep. The next morning, Hornblower's men are confused as to why Hornblower gave Forget charge in the first place as they note they are probably heading for France. Hornblower says they will never find the coastline to begin with, since Hornblower himself wrote the wrong direction on the chart meaning that Forget is sailing further away from his destination instead of closer. Suddenly, Forget and one of his men begin arguing and the man is hit and thrown to the floor. Hornblower grabs the pistol off the man and holds it to Forget, where they debate for awhile until the Indefatigable comes into view in order to aid our young Midshipman and take the Frenchies back to London. When they reach the Indefatigable, we see Forget & his men walk off to the brig as the seamen and Hornblower step aboard and congratulated on a job well-done. Hornblower goes to greet Kennedy, when he is suddenly called upon by Pellew. Moments later, Pellew is congratulating Hornblower on a job well-done. When suddenly, a French frigate named the Papillon is spotted. All hands beat to quarters, pretty soon the Papillon vanishes into the mist. When they spot the remains of one of their own ships, not knowing if there are any surviors: Pellew sends Hornblower and a few of his men to search the waters. Hornblower & his crew hop into a rowboat (deja vu) and row into the midst of the ocean. They find a couple of men, clinging onto their life as know it. They are pulled into the boat, Hornblower gives his coat to keep them warm. As he goes to pull in another survivor, he see's a very familiar tattoo spread across the man's knuckle. Their eyes meet. It is indeed Simpson, alive and well. ", "\nWhen they come back aboard, all the officers are called to Pellew's cabin where Simpson fakes a few tears and tells them the \"tragic\" story of how the Justinina was condemned to the ocean. Hornblower and Kennedy watch each other, aware of just how well Simpson can act. Pellew tells Simpson to not distress himself further and he pulls out his maps, saying that the only way to defeat the Papillon is to overtake it. As Eccleston discusses these plans, Hornblower and Kennedy alike begin to become haunted with the voice of Simpson as it rings in their heads. When the map rolls back up, the two jump, obviously coming out of their trances. Pellew orders for Eccleston to take the officers whom are under his command and attack the Papillon, Simpson insists that he comes along due to the fact that he was aboard and knows the ship well. Pellew asks Eccleston on Simpson's behalf, and Eccleston says they would love to have him on this mission and he insists that he will travel with Hornblower and Kennedy. Kennedy is obviously displeased, as is Hornblower. Simpson only shrugs. Later on, Kennedy goes below deck and see's his hat and as he reaches to grab it he hears a voice behind him. He turns to see Simpson, whom tells him just how much he has missed him. As he is about to advance on Kennedy, Hornblower enters the scene. Simpson tells Hornblower that he and Kennedy were only catching up on old times, Hornblower says that these are new times and he has no hold over them whilst aboard the Indefatigable. Simpson says no, he looks at Kennedy and repeats himself. Hornblower excuses himself and Kennedy and they walk away, Simpson watches them in the shadows. As night falls, everyone is preparing to sneak aboard the Papillon. Eccleston observes his men, to be sure they are well-prepared. Hornblower whispers to Kennedy if he is nervous, there is no answer. As the men pile into the rowboats and head for the Papillon, there seems to be no complication in their plan. Until, Kennedy falls to the ground and is obviously having another one of his fits. Everyone is aware if he keeps yelling then he will disturb everyone aboard the Papillon, Matthews and Oldroyd hold him as Hornblower urges him to be quiet and he is unable. Oldroyd gets his hand over Kennedy's mouth but it does not help in any form, Hornblower finally finds a tool, very similiar to the one that Clayton used on his own head, and he clubs Kennedy ultimately knocking him out. They finally reach the Papillon, all of the men begin to quietly climb up the sides of the ship as Hornblower makes it aboard. He tries to be as quiet as possible, however the silence is shortlived when he trips over a bucket. Two guards hear him, and he shoots them dead. The others come aboard and attack the crew of the Papillon, with all this fighting and shouting they realize the important thing is to set the sails. Eccleston sends Hornblower and some of the seamen up to perform this task. So, Hornblower along with Matthews, Finch, and Oldroyd climb up while Eccleston and the others continue to kill the men of the Papillon. While climbing, Stevens tries to get to the sail himself by jumping onto it but Hornblower protests. Stevens attempts and fails, falling to his death. The others make it to the top, and try to find a way across. Chadd and Eccleston are down below and growing deeply worried as to why Hornblower is frozen and not obeying his orders. Hornblower takes a deep breath and begins to walk along the sail, treating it like a balance beam. It doesn't help that he is deathly afraid of heights, or that he if falls he wouldn't survive. Eccleston smiles as Hornblower finally makes it to the other side and he and Finch begin to work untying the sail. Simpson looks up and realizes that Hornblower is once again doing something he finds displeasurable, being the hero. Simpson refuses to see the PERFECT man make it out of this alive, and he knows the perfect way to be rid of him. He grabs a knife off one of the dead officers and cuts the ropes that are keeping the rowboat still, and watches as the rowboat begins to move away with Kennedy in it! Hornblower finally gets the sail prepared when he see's Kennedy unconcious and inside a moving rowboat, this distracts him long enough for Simpson to lift his pistol and shoot Hornblower square in the brow. Hornblower falls into the water, and we believe him to drown. Simpson goes to Eccleston and tells him that the French have fallen back and that the ship is theirs, Eccleston praises God and tells Simpson to give his regards to Hornblower. Simpson reports that Hornblower fell into the water and is most likely dead, Eccleston seems suscpcious. We see Hornblower drifting closer to the bottom of the ocean, when Finch grabs him and rescues him.", "\nThe next morning, the Indefatigable is on the watch when Pellew see's that the Papillon is about to find itself in a horrid battle. Aboard the Papillon, Finch is cleaning Hornblower's wound when he says that while he was shot he will make a good recovery. Hornblower asks what happened to Kennedy, Styles and Oldroyd inform him that the rowboat nor Kennedy were found. Terribly distraught, Hornblower goes to see a bloodied Eccleston who tells him that those French will do anything to see victory, obviously referring to Hornblower's gun wound. Hornblower says it wasn't a Frenchie who shot him, it was Simpson. Eccleston warns Hornblower that he just made a serious accusation against another officer, Hornblower swears it's the truth. They can hear the sounds of distance cannons, Eccleston quickly tells Hornblower that he will address the matter when they get back aboard the Indefatigable. Suddenly, another cannon fires and hits the Papillon it sends Hornblower flying into the air and he lands. He's a bit brusied but overall in good condition, Matthews helps him to his feet and Hornbower rushes to see if Eccleston is all right. Apparently he isn't, both Chadd and Eccleston are crushed underneath a fallen pole. Eccleston is so out of it that he mistakes Hornblower for Chadd, Hornblower assures him that it's only him as in Mr.Hornblower, Hornblower yells for a surgeon. Eccleston wants to know if Chadd is all right, Bowles checks Chadd for a pulse and alas there is none. Hornblower tells Eccleston that Chadd is dead, Eccleston with what little strength he has leaves his final command. He tells Hornblower that he is Captain of the Papollion, and tells him to make it back to Indefatigable safely. With those final words, Eccleston dies in peace. Hornblower is upset by this sudden loss, however Simpson is less than sympathetic. He orders for both of the bodies to be condemned and to set the sails, Hornblower says that Eccleston left him in charge and tells Bowles to tell Simpson. Bowles reminds Hornblower that Simpson is senior officer, Hornblower argues since he was left orders by a higher ranking than they must fall out. Hornblower orders Matthews and Styles to take Simpson below, but Simpson protests and yells that he is charge. Hornblower stands his ground, he tells Bowles to be sure that Simpson arrives at the brig without a problem and if he gives anybody ANY trouble, he has his permission to shoot him. Simpson is taken to the brig, just as the Papollion is put under attack. With Hornblower as Captain, he barely manages to save the life of his crew & the ship. They arrive back aboard the Indefatigable, Pellew again congraluates him. He sadly says that judging by everything, that Hornblower is in charge and Eccleston is...Hornblower confirms that Eccleston is indeed dead. Pellew sighs and asks how Hornblower sustained such an awful injury. ", "\nSeconds later, we are in Pellew's cabin. Simpson accuses Hornblower of telling \"a damn lie\" he apologizes for using such language. Simpson accuses Hornblower of lying just because he cowarded when he was meant to face off with him, Simpson even says he challenged Hornblower once more but he refused. Pellew warns Simpson to not speak out of terms, he tells Simpson that he gave Hornblower a comission which makes him enabled to take part in any form of a duel. Pellew removes the comission but advises Hornblower against it. Hornblower has made up his mind and make this statement: \"I maintain the charge against Mr.Simpson, sir! However, since I cannot prove it other than with my body, I have no choice but to accept his challenge!\" The next morning, Hornblower is on land. Along with the seamen, Hepplewhite, and Simpson. Another duel is about to be taken underway. Simpson and Hornblower stand back to back, Simpson tries to distract Hornblower by whispering the terrible reminder of Clayton's death and how he will kill him just as he did him. Hornblower does his best to ignore it, trying not to think on Clayton. Simpson says he will also die just as Kennedy did, this gets to Hornblower but not enough to distract him on the task at hand. Hepplewhite tells the men to take ten steps away from each other, they do so. They face each other and lift their pistols, Hepplewhite goes over the rules and asks them if they understand. They both nod. Hepplewhite is able to count to two, before Simpson fires and shoots Hornblower in the shoulder. Hepplewhite argues with Simpson while the others check on Hornblower, Simpson asks if he killed him. Hornblower grunts and picks himself off the ground, he lunges himself at Simpson and attacks him and steals his pistol away. With two pistols in his hand, Hornblower is shocked when Simpson falls to his knees and begs for Hornblower not to shoot him. A sadden Hornblower, fires into the air which shocks Simpson. Hornblower tells Simpson he isn't worth the powder, he turns to walk away. Simpson takes this as an insult and finds his knife, as he races at Hornblower another gunshot rings into the air. Hornblower turns and see's Simpson is shot in the chest, he dies moments later. Who fired? Surely not Hornblower. The camera scans over to the rocks, we see Bowles and Pellew standing together. Bowles asks Pellew if he may congraluate him on an expectional shot, Pellew says he may. Aboard the Indefatigable, Hornblower thanks Pellew for killing Simpson. Pellew accepts his gratitude and then tells Hornblower his own words of wisdom: \"You have fought your duel. That is well. Never fight another. That is better.\" The film comes to its close as Hornblower and Pellew overlook the men of the Indefatigable and sail for another journey."]},

Olya the girl in the beginning of the movie features her personal weaknesses, or bad habits, or let's call it sins. She is craving for grandma's jam so much, that she discards grandma's word no to touch the jam, and breaks the can as she tries to eat some. Also Olya is recreant, lazy, irresponsible, sweet-tooth to the extent of forgetting about more important things. In other words Olya features a number of bad habits typical for children of her age. And through possession of these bad habits she becomes attracted to the fairy-tale surreal world of \"Kingdom of crooked mirrors\" which in fact is some kind of anti-world where all inhabitants bear reversed names to be read backwards to understand the true nature of the character. The kingdom is ruled by bizarre and evil characters featuring different animals like Parrot, Adder, Falcon, Toad (all shall be read backwards), and in fact represent a fake and gullish monarch Parrot, and three ruthless, cunning and power loathing tycoons: Toad, Adder and Falcon, who really rule the Kingdom. Played by people dressed and made up accordingly. In order to cement their power over the Kingdom they lean upon what probably should be described as total and systematic lying, or people's mass misinformation, by producing and disseminating only crooked mirrors. For this end they arrested the mirror-maker Friend who refused to produce crooked mirrors. So the CMK world represents where do Olya's weaknesses or bad habits would finally take her if not eradicated timely and properly. During her trip in the Kingdom Olya is accompanied by her mirror twin Yalio, who has no bad habits, but acts accordingly to her age. The main goal is to free the mirror-maker Friend from the Death Tower, which means the end of the Kingdom of Crooked mirrors. Olya has to overcome her own weaknesses and bad habits on her way to the goal, otherwise the ruling of Adder, Falcon, and Toad will never end. It is important to understand that in the USSR production of movies was controlled by Art councils, so the final product is kinda a balance between the movie director and Art council, therefore something resembling propaganda can sometimes be expected. But if you understand the entire story and the plot, you will see that Kingdom is a materialization of one's bad habits taken to the logical absolute to show to kids how important is to take an active and firm position in life and to stick to the truth, that in adult life you will have to take an active position, you will have to distinguish your friends from enemies, and you will have to act accordingly. Well, from the point of view of Adder, Falcon, and Toad this must be a very dangerous propaganda."]},

Dieter's past traumas and current stability (although he's still preoccupied by the idea of closed doors and is still hoarding vast unneeded emergency food supplies - the former seems a bit staged, but that's part of the intrigue) seem to chime with Herzog's own past glories and now relative reduced state, and the title with its obviously childish edge has an air of longing and acknowledgment of past fantasies and their fatal possibilities. But despite the true pain of the\tmonologue, Herzog doesn't dwell on adversity, but rather on the ultimate grandeur (for example, the final image of thousands of military planes parked in the desert) - in which context his movie seems to fall short of the true cosmic resonance of some of Errol Morris' work. But he coaxes Dieter's story expertly and has the classic strengths of a good story-teller, and the movie's quite fascinating even if it doesn't completely gel in all respects."]},

Slow paced with little action, and full of plot holes everywhere which are never resolved by the end, Midnight Warrior does not succeed in fulfilling its potential. A few explosions are thrown in for good measure.  Midnight Warrior had a great idea in its hands, but the overall resultant is a disorganized, unkempt hodgepodge. It's pure low budget silliness with an invalid script, plain and simple.

There's a modicum of full-frontal female nudity, this being 1970, but the loops seem to have been chosen randomly, with hardly any highlights to speak of.", "Only theme is a ton of footage set at the beach, both posed models going topless and considerable filler that merely shows gals sunning themselves in their bikinis or wandering around.

In the 1965 version Judy Adler stars, it's a talkie (NUDES INC. was shot MOS with narration added) and is a more honest presentation of the material.", "The b.s. level in NUDES INC. is very high, as our helpful narrator tells us at least a dozen times how legitimate this company is (transparently standing in for Mahon's own soft porn empire), how hard it is for women in New York to make a living, and the wonderfulness of earning $50 to $300 a day disrobing for the camera \"with no strings attached\". So patrons of Adult Theaters of the day were essentially subjected to an hour of self-serving propaganda justifying the pornographer's role in our society. It reminds me of the current \"job-creation\" statistics being cited anent the ongoing rush to legalize marijuana use not just in Colorado but everywhere.", "The upside of this exercise is the chance to see beautiful breasts and nipples in a movie theater in 1964, and Mahon doesn't' stint. Especially delivering the goods is lovely Gigi Darlene, whose orbs shot in low angle are still stimulating 50 years later, She is identified as Gigi by the narrator, and his reciting of her back story as a German refugee to America is surprisingly true. The Bennett twins also pop up, and while not drop-dead beauties the other gals all display attractive racks for our listening pleasure.", "The later film used melodrama to hold the audience, as Mahon's heroine Judy Adler suffered through the gropes, propositions and other man-handling by unscrupulous & horny photographers, ad men and huckster movie producers. A hint of that plot line is included in NUDES INC. as we watch in flashback brief case histories of other models getting the runaround.", "Some nice location photography of Midtown Manhattan circa 1964 is included to break up the repetition of girls disrobing & posing, over & over again.

The sex scenes don't work too well either, dragging on for 5-10 minutes at a stretch and featuring some uglies who should have been paid to stay clothed. The film would have probably worked better as a straight period piece, since surprisingly most of the cast are fairly decent in their roles. Rocco, although wooden as the Trojan Horse with his facial expressions, does the best among all the cast as Marc Antony. The film actually gets less comical as it rolls on, turning dead serious in the last 10 minutes! And most shocking of all, it actually seems to work better that way."]},

Ironically, the film's claim to fame, which Poole explains put him into retirement for good, was the early death from AIDs of one of its leading players, Dave Connors, whose typically unprotected sex in the video led to Poole being castigated in the Gay Community for supposedly spreading AIDs by shooting porn with infected players. He denies this charge, but I found his extremely lame description of followup damning: basically personally contacting the actor Steve Kaye who he cast opposite Connors for a sex scene but quickly losing touch with Kaye and having no idea whether he ever got infected or what happened to him.", "Beyond this dark cloud hanging over the project, the video itself is junk - more of the gonzo sex footage that Poole is so highly praised for, due to his pretentious presentation. It's merely three sex scenes, conforming to the title as solo, boy/boy and then troilism, followed by a 5-man circle jerk from the cast. Only interesting footage is provided by J.D. Slater, credited with a lengthy monologue which fits in with the performance art movement of the period - think of artists like Penny Arcade.", "What infuriates me is how Poole and his coterie of admirers try to make silk from sow's ears. This tedious exercise is shot entirely against black backdrops with harsh lighting, its minimalism supposedly some sort of artistic triumph. As in his prior pretentious films notably BIJOU, gimmicks and filigrees added to the loop level sex content represent The Emperor's New Clothes syndrome at its most obvious.", "The oft-repeated myth surrounding Poole, which he concocted himself, is that he was so disappointed at the poor quality of (gay) porn that he watched in the early days of theaters showing XXX material, that he, untrained in cinema, decided he could do better \"and the rest is history\". Yes, he scored a couple of hits with explicit homosexual themed sex movies, but no amount of revisionism can convince me that they are anything more than gussied-up examples of the same mindless gonzo content he decried."]},

Since I'm the first to review it on IMDb, one can deduce a certain lack of interest out there in preserving it for posterity, the revival undoubtedly spurred by the anonymous filmmakers' (only \"a De Soto film\" credit appears mysteriously at the end) failure to copyright the contents.", "Before the film devolves to the usual cheap interior \"sets\" (a couch and a mattress is about it), we are introduced to Richard wandering around presumably San Francisco, going to various bars and night spots as indicated by a montage of their marquees. It's good old Joey Silvera (billed as \"Buck Wuzz\"), comfortably playing an unsympathetic guy who (like Clint in the original) is a heartless womanizer, though in this opus he gets punished rather than dishing out his usual macho roughness towards womankind.", "The director does not include any transition shots or scenes, so without further ado he's chatting middle-Warhol-period on a couch with the unappealing Kris (ample breasted shorty Dianne Galke billed as \"Dy Anne\", sporting a severe Irish lilt if not accent to her way of speaking). Kris declares she's not interested in drink or music and refuses to talk about herself, so at an improvised verbal impasse Richard reaches out and grabs her breast. Her reaction telegraphs the goofiness of this flick, as she responds by reaching out for his crotch, and nature takes its course. Even odder is her toting a revolver, which takes Richard aback, but with the prospect of sex, he quickly ignores this aberration.", "The sex scene is scored oddly to Kris Kristofferson country-folk style music (perhaps because the anti-heroine is named Kris?). When she seems to have moved in the next day, waking him up with groceries and an offer to cook & serve breakfast in bed, Richard is gruff and practically throws her out of his place, claiming \"I don't want an old lady\".", "He's next seen on a pay phone calling Janet, telling her he's tired of playing the field and wants a permanent relationship with her. Their subsequent sex scene is scored to a French ballad. Janet is played by black adult star Desiree West (billed as \"Jo Jo Gumm\"), and refreshingly the interracial relationship is not alluded to at all in the \"screenplay\". Film really goes off the rails when Kris phones Richard while he's making love to Janet, he doesn't answer but leaves the phone off the hook (not to be disturbed by it ringing again) and Kris masturbates as she hears the sounds of sex.", "Richard gets mad when Jessica Walter-style Kris possessively visits him, and next thing you know she's trying to make him jealous my making love to Oscar (played by that prematurely balding porn stalwart John Seeman who vaguely resembles John C. McGinley, billed here as \"Jeff Box\"), phoning Richard again to make him listen to her having sex, while taunting him.", "All the while Kris keeps whipping out her revolver, which Oscar tolerates somewhat apprehensively. Film climaxes abruptly with Richard and Janet awaking handcuffed together, Kris holding them at gunpoint in a Sadean scene right out of PHILOSOPHY IN THE BEDROOM, as she orchestrates various sexual acts. At one point she nearly penetrates Janet with her gun barrel, foreshadowing the famous Elmore Leonard-meets-Abel Ferrara scene in CAT CHASER.", "Film ends cryptically with Kris carefully wrapping the fornicating duo in a blanket, neatly tying it up, and she leaves triumphantly.", "This farrago falls into the familiar movie category of \"insulting the audience\", a Brechtian format perfected by Jean-Luc Godard and little commented upon by critics. With the past decade or two's revival of so many thousands of \"disreputable\" titles there is a condescending attitude by their video distributors (and also by the so-called, self-appointed \"film historians\" paid like whores to write laudatory liner notes for the VHS and DVD covers/booklets) towards the original audiences for this material. They forget that serious film buffs (and I'm one of them) have had an independent streak and traditionally consumed all sorts of cinema, not just \"all bad\" or \"all pretentious\". I find it comical that the pseudo-sophisticated latter-day taste mongers, who were too young to view earlier decades' films first-run, are just as insulting as the untalented filmmakers who cranked out this material in the first place. ", "Both sets of boors like to look down their noses at the audience. In the '70s I was a drive-in devotee (no hardcore permitted, as neighbors would object), not a porn house maven watching Triple X rated stuff, but I'm coming to the defense of film buffs of all stripes, in-door as well as out-door. And when I was a professional film critic for Variety throughout the '80s, I never addressed the audience as \"slobs\", \"wankers\" or \"raincoat brigade\" but treated them with the utmost respect. And unlike these current know-it-alls, I was unafraid to tell a big shot filmmaker to get out of town (see my very negative pre-release reviews of GHOSTBUSTERS and von Trier's ZENTROPA) or praise a previously ignored potboiler (e.g., THE LOVE BUTCHER)."]},

Something about not having enough assertive women. Anyway, Chasey stars as the time-traveling alien who jumps from era to era and convinces some of history's most famous females to take matters into their own hands -- when it comes to sex, that is.

The erotic high point just might be the opening scene, though, in which Chasey plays Eve to Tom Byron's Adam. The pair engage in a high-pitched tryst in which Chasey is as enthused and energetic as she's ever been on camera -- it's a stupendously arousing scene for fans of the porno super starlet. There's plenty more sex along the way, including a pair of throbbing three ways, but this is basically a showcase for the irresistible charms of Chasey, one of the most gorgeous gals to ever sex for the porno cameras."]},

In another room, Andy (Randy Spears) is being coached by Canada (Victoria Paris). The actresses being interviewed give reasonable performances, especially Juliette (Kelly Royce). She should have been on screen a lot more than she was. The outstanding performance was the Victoria Paris and Randy Spears scene. A naked Victoria Paris spread out on a bed ready to receive a man has got to be one of the most iconic images ever committed to the screen. They acted as if they were really making love rather than just having sex and this intensity made the scene.", "This was a very enjoyable effort despite the censor's scissors and the clip repetition. Also, a bit more care could have been taken with the close-ups. Whether they were directorial or censorial pan and scan is a moot point.

T.

I prefer to watch it not as a \"classic\" but rather a demonstration of the merits of storytelling to (however uncommercial it might be) lift a porn project above mere documentary depiction of explicit sex acts."]},

I might rewatch this in a near future. But for the time being I keep with a down\nopinion about it.", "\"Pátriamada\" (\"BelovedCountry\" written altogether) tells the story of a conflicted love triangle during the final days of the military regime in Brazil when the nation was\ngathering for the return of democracy with the Congress voting on the issue of the direct vote for presidential elections in 1985. Key figures in the situation are a wealthy\nbusinessman (Walmor Chagas), a man who profited a great deal with the current political system but he's more inclined in changing the game and he declares support to the democracy,\nideas brought on by an idealist reporter (Débora Bloch) of whom he has an affair; and there's the third wheel, her political activist boyfriend (Buza Ferraz), and both follow the\npolitical movement on the streets and interview politicians and artists who reflect the new ideals of the period.", "That's the surprising and amazing part of the movie since the actual\nevents of Diretas Já campaign are covered and the characters interact with the real figures, the real artists and the real politicians interviewing them, or following their rallies\nacross the country, so you have a part fictional film mixed with a documentary that doesn't ring false in any aspect. It's the truth happening in front of you and you can get the\nzeitgeist of the period where people were excited about politics, they wanted to see change and you see everybody moving along, both favorable or opposed to a change in the game.", "Political representatives on the side of Diretas like Brizola, Lula, Dante de Oliveira, Ulysses Guimarães all appear as themselves being interviewed by Débora's character, and there's\neven time to include then president Figueiredo as part of the opposition trying to calm people's animosity (and we know back then the cold, at times violent, distance the military\nput journalists on. The infamous video of general Newton Cruz attacking a reporter is a classic example). The line between fiction and reality is so thin that for a moment you start\nthinking the actors are actually real life characters truly involved in this scenario. And it's thanks to the openness of the regime at the time that a movie like this could be made,\nand had it been just a documentary it'd probably never seen the light of day since censorship was still a thing.", "The ideas and its relevance for the period in presenting the importance of the direct vote's return and how the public perception was favorable to it, makes of this movie a\ntrue testament of its period, and it works a lot better than just seeing news clips that remember that era in countless documentaries presented. It isn't an overview seeing from the\ndistance; this is ground level, from the period and with many insiders who were part of that history. For those moments this movie succeeds in being a brilliant piece of cinema and\nhistory. But as the fiction progresses with the confusing love story and the fights between the businessman and his family of numb wife and spoiled brat of a kid who works with the\nman, the movie drags on and on without a satisfying note, without an appeal so we could care for those characters. They are not challenging enough, they are all very one-dimensional.", "Maybe it's a direction problem, I don't find Tizuka Yamazaki a strong name to carry a film like this, since she's best known for her box-office entertainment hits like the flicks\nshe did with Xuxa (sure, she has other serious and well reviewed films such as \"Gaijin\" but most people associate her with Xuxa films).", "It was a missed opportunity and with a more developed script it could turn into a 1980's classic. As said, I might return to it if I have the time and if feeling the need\nfor it (I usually do that with films I don't like at first glance, some film reviewers do that immediately and then create a defined opinion). Since it's still fresh in my mind, it'll\ntake some time. This downer review is just a way to form some thoughts and impressions about it, so I'm not suugesting you to avoid it neither being favorable enough to make you watch it,\nbut something tells me that viewers who are curious about that historical period won't find much of an enlightning picture here neither will find it a nice \"fiction\" to follow. For those\nwho lived those times, it'll be a fine nostalgic trip, slightly incomplete with something. But the passion, the positive feelings, the emotion from the crowd, is all there. If compared\nto what came in those 30 years later in terms of political engagement from the public, those were lovely and respectful times; the division that came after that became sickening, violent\nand the word democracy became a shameful term to be used. It became a fight to the death where collective ideals are seen as negative and personal interests dominate the discussion of\npower. We still struggle. 5/10."]},

By destroying her he hopes to obtain control of the millions and the immense munitions plant she has inherited. He learns that Elaine, a popular dancer appearing in the \"Midnight Frolic,\" is the exact double of Patria, and he conceived the idea of doing away with the latter and substituting Elaine in her place. Through Fanny Adair, a widow, intimate with Patria and who has lost all her money but still hangs on to the fringe of the society in which she once shone, Elaine is coached for her part. So complete is their likeness that when Elaine's manager sees Patria with Capt. Parr he attacks him in a jealous rage and tries to carry her off thinking it is Elaine. Parr follows him down the back stairs and after a fight overcomes him with Patria's help. Patria has planned to return to Newport with Fanny Adair and Capt. Parr on the Fall River Line boat. Huroki sends Elaine aboard disguised as an invalid in charge of a nurse. She has a stateroom next to Patria's and Fanny Adair. In the meanwhile Capt. Parr has been arrested on a charge of assault on the evening before, inspired by Huroki, and misses the boat. That night when Patria is on deck she is thrown overboard by Huroki's hirelings. Elaine slips into Patria's stateroom where Fanny, trembling with fear, awaits her, and the nurse gives the alarm that her charge has escaped and jumped overboard. Will Patria perish?", "Episode 5: \"The Island God Forgot\" Patria manages to keep afloat by means of the life preserver which Fanny Adair to ease her guilty conscience threw to her. Donald Parr flies in his hydroplane to Newport, where Elaine with her close resemblance to Patria has fooled her hostess. Donald is bewildered by Patria's refusal to see him. Receiving a suspicious communication, he follows the messenger and learns he is one of a colony of spies inhabiting an island twenty miles from shore, on which are stored munitions. In the meanwhile Patria has floated to this island, where a man named Juarez finds her unconscious on the beach and revives her. Haku, the commander, announces his determination to kill Patria in accordance with rules regarding all invaders. Juarez defends her by keeping Haku at bay with a can of nitroglycerin. In attempting to aid Patria's escape in an aeroplane Juarez is shot. With no other choice, Patria plunges again into the sea. Meanwhile, Donald, who has followed in his hydroplane, is startled by Patria's cry for help. Sweeping down, he rescues her. Haku pursues in the aeroplane Juarez had removed from the hangar, taking with him the nitroglycerin. High in the air he exchanges shots with Donald. One of the shots at Haku strikes home; his machine falls on the storehouse of explosives and completely demolishes the \"Island God Forgot.\"", "Episode 3: \"Winged Millions\" Patria and Donald return and find the secret service on guard at the underground entrance to the vault. They are joined by Ryley, Donald's assistant, and a mechanic. Neither Patria nor Donald suspect that Huroki has stolen the treasure but when they are fired upon by the house next door, Donald starts to investigate. He goes through the half-burned Channing mansion, and crossing to the next roof finds that the scuttle has been forced. On locating the room from which the shots were fired he jerks open the door, kills the gunman and rushes out to find the vans gone. He makes inquiries and goes in pursuit of the treasure. Patria has followed Donald into the next house. Her search leads to the cellar, where she discovers the breach in the wall and learns of the loss of the treasure. Huroki's henchman captures and ties her to a chair. He places dynamite and after lighting a time fuse departs. Patria screams and realizing that help cannot reach her from the outside gets her right hand free and severs the fuse with a shot from her revolver. Ryley and his mechanics cut through the steel door with an acetylene outfit and Patria is rescued. She tells Ryley not to bother about the money but to find Donald. Donald has followed the vans to a pier alongside which is moored the Japanese freighter Sandai aboard which the treasure has been placed. He slips aboard and conceals himself in the hold. The ship sails but a fog retards her progress. Donald gains the upper deck unobserved, and at the point of his big revolver compels the operator to send the following wireless to Patria: \"S.S. Sandai. Fog bound in lower bay. Advise Ryley.\" Before Donald can retreat to his hiding place his presence is discovered by Huroki and he is overpowered, beaten, and placed in the hold. Patria receives the message, and leaving directions that Ryley be notified, starts in a motorboat to overtake the Sandai. She succeeds and steers alongside without being seen, because of the fog. The exhaust of her motor has been heard, however, and when she climbs aboard is caught by the sailors and locked up in a stateroom. She manages to get out, dives into the sea, and swimming to her motorboat starts off. The fog has lifted, and those on the Sandai are alarmed to observe a U.S. torpedo boat. They try to put on speed but when a shot is sent across her bows conclude to sink the ship and take to the boats. The water pouring into the hold has reached Donald's neck when he is saved by American jackies, for the torpedo boat has picked up Patria, and she leads the search until Donald is rescued. It is then discovered that his peril was not extreme because the Japanese had sunk their ship in shallow water and she soon touched bottom. Huroki and De Lima with the Japanese crew escape and land on the Jersey shore.", "Episode 6: \"Alias Nemesis\" Patria being advised that Huroki's assassins may attempt her life, goes into hiding in a cottage at Sakonett. Meanwhile Elaine, still masquerading as Patria, announces her engagement to Senor De Lima. Elaine gives a masked ball at the Patria villa with dancing on the lawn by moonlight. Patria, accompanied by Donald, contrives to get in unnoticed, and goes to her room, leaving Donald concealed in the hall. Patria, wearing a mask, sends a maid for Elaine. When Elaine arrives she faces a revolver and is ordered to take off her clothes and change with Patria. Elaine's manager, Edouard, crazed by drink, end in a jealous rage, climbs into the window, shoots Elaine and disappears. Donald rushes in, advises Patria and goes out another door as Huroki, Senor De Lima and Fanny Adair enter. Pointing to the body of the dancer, Patria, assuming the part of Elaine, tells Huroki Patria is dead and that it is up to him to cover up the murder. Meanwhile Edouard rushes to the cliff and."]},

The backdrop of the film is the political unrest that followed the violation of the constitution by the then King and before the coup-d'etat of the colonels. This backdrop, however, is discreetly there in the background when the sound of demonstrations is heard in the salons of high society (a daily event then). The nouveau-riche character of Athenian high society (climbing the Acropolis at dawn to admire a view of the Hilton) is so real and it hasn't changed much. Some jokes are esoteric and would be lost today - for example the shipowner who drops a pocketful of coins on the couch (all but one of which are golden sovereigns): He keeps the sovereigns and gives the solitary drachma to the poor teacher of English sitting next to him saying \"this drachma is yours\". Nothing much but \"this drachma is yours\" was the slogan of the conservatives against the centre union party which the King had recently deposed."]},

She believes this because, when she was 14, she had a dream in\nwhich Elvis told her he was going into hiding. The next day, the news was\nall over that Elvis had died. Of course, the publishers to whom she is\ntrying to sell her story tell her that she is a crackpot.", "One day, as Iris and her goth friend Emma Cross are sitting at the\ncounter of the goth shoppe where they both work and discussing Iris's lack\nof a love life, Iris looks out the window and sees Elvis standing there.\nBy the time Emma looks up, Elvis has disappeared. Yeah, it probably was\njust a vision, Iris agrees. Later that day, however, as Iris walks home,\nshe bumps into Elvis again. It turns out that \"Elvis\" is really Eddie\nVincent [Paul Stevenson]. What Iris doesn't know is that Eddie Vincent is also a vampire,\nhaving been turned by his own brother Wrecks back in 1956 while on his way\nto an Elvis lookalike contest. Unlike Wrecks, Eddie doesn't like being a\nvampire, and he drinks human blood only when the craving becomes\noverwhelming and then only from drunks, thugs, and other undesirable\npersons.", "When Wrecks [Stephen Blackehart] and his two henchmen, T-Bone and Greasy, come looking for\nEddie (so Wrecks can bite Eddie for the second time, which will place\nEddie under his power for all eternity), Eddie goes on the defensive.\nAfraid that Wrecks might harm Iris, on whom Eddie is starting to get\nsweet, Eddie tells Iris that he and Wrecks are vampires and says a sad\ngoodbye to Iris...but not fast enough. Wrecks finds Iris at the local\ndiner, having a fried banana sandwich on Wonder bread, and can tell from\nthe smell that Eddie has been with her. When Wrecks begins to threaten\nIris, the diner manager chases him out. Iris pays her bill and goes\noutside, where she finds Eddie, bloody-handed and standing over the dead\nmanager, whose throat is equally as bloody. Eddie swears that it was\nWrecks who did the killing and pleads with Iris to hide him at her\napartment until they can figure out what to do.", "Eddie is beginning to get hungry for blood. When Lorenzo, a Beatle\nwannabee who is also sweet on Iris, comes to inform her that, if she\ndoesn't go out with him, he's going to get Juju the Voodoo Guru to put a\nlove spell on her, Eddie and Beatle Boy get into a fight, and Eddie ends\nup drinking his blood (Beatle Boy's final words, \"Help, I need\nsomebody...\"), finally convincing Iris that he's serious about being a\nvampire. Now believing that Eddie needs blood, Iris (and Eddie), wearing\nred bandanas over their noses, stage a daring robbery of a blood bank,\nmaking off with a pint. Unfortunately, the blood is bad and Eddie barfs it\nup. Fearing that Eddie is fading fast, Iris offers him her neck. The next\nmorning, Iris wakes up a vampire.", "Meanwhile, Iris's scuzzy landlord Benny Lawalski, whose father was\nrecently killed by what looks to Detective Crapoe like a vampire bite,\nnotices Iris reading Carol Page's book Bloodlust, and he begins to get\nsuspicious. While Iris is showing Emma the cool bites on her neck, Benny\nsuddenly shows up at the shoppe with a crossbow, intending to destroy\nIris. Benny forces Iris to lead him to Eddie, who immediately overpowers\nBenny and knocks him out. Eddie and Iris attempt to leave the apartment\nbut they are seen by Wrecks and his henchmen who follow Eddie and Iris to\nthe roof where they try to escape. Just as Wrecks starts to put the bite\non Eddie, however, Benny shows up and shoots a wooden dart through Wrecks'\nheart. Benny then strangles T-Bone with a string of garlic and sends\nanother dart through Greasy's heart. When Benny turns the crossbow on\nEddie, Iris steps in front of him and takes the dart herself. Wrecks wakes\nup just long enough to bite Benny's neck, while Eddie pulls the dart from\nIris's chest. Fortunately, it missed her heart. When Iris has healed\nenough to travel, Eddie steals a red convertible, and they both drive off\ntogether to find Elvis. [Original Synopsis by bj_kuehl]"]},

With their marriage begins Napoleon's arduous military career, in the hardships of which Josephine shares. The outcome of these efforts and privations is the Imperial Throne, with Napoleon as Emperor, and Josephine as consort. Their happiness is marred, however, by the fact that no son has been born to them, and thus the Emperor's dreams of a mighty dynasty cannot be fulfilled. Josephine sacrifices her position as Wife and Queen that Napoleon's desire may be fulfilled, and the haughty Arch-Duchess-Marie Louise, of Austria, reigns in her stead. To the successor of Josephine is born a boy. With his birth, Napoleon's career commences its descent. The retreat from Moscow is followed by an insurrection in Paris, where the crowd attacks the Royal Palace. Marie Louise, terror-stricken, seeks refuge in her boudoir, and only the arrival of Josephine quells the mob's anger and saves Napoleon's son. As a result of his failures, Napoleon abdicates, and his wife and son flee to the protection of her father in Austria. Exiled to Elba, Napoleon's dreams appear to be shattered, but later he is recalled, and for one hundred days is Emperor of France again. This brief kingship closes with Waterloo, and is followed by his second exile to St. Helena, where he died."]},

After failing to get a job as an actor in Rio,\nwhich was weird since he had the looks as pointed out by a woman who said he looked exactly like famous star Eddie Polo, he returns back to his state, buys a camera and\nstarts making his own movies with the intent of making and showing the good cinema of Rio Grande do Sul.", "His initial experiments are met with laughter due to the amateur quality of his productions, mostly made among friends, but he gets some encouragement from\naudiences who become his contributors for his next films and the loyal support of an experienced theater actress (Débora Bloch). A partnership is formed and they\nstart making more films, one of them being \"O Pecado da Vaidade\", a dense melodrama that was met with huge criticism by audiences claiming it to be imoral and against\ngood costumes due to a kissing scene (oh the times...). And with that, Edu begins to question if his art is valid or worth doing since audiences fail to understand\nwhat's he showing.", "This is a humored and interesting film on the pioneering days of a Brazilian filmmaker, a very encouraging story about pursuing a dream and fighting each and\nevery obstacle, and despite such description it's not a corny film. The period recreation of the early 1930's is very detailed and accurate. But the mystery as from\nwhere director Lauro Escorel managed to recreate Abelim's films remains since his films are all lost and even to find information on the internet about are really\nrare to find. He probably had read some news articles of the period or managed to interview people who watched those films back in the day. Since practically nothing\nabout the man can be found - unless some film library out there - but I'd really like to know about Abelim's documentaries covering the Vargas revolution in 1930 of\nwhich he joined to cross the country, where are those movies and what happened to him in later years (he died in 1984, two years before this movie's release and never\nreturned to make another film).", "I fascinated by this story from a different era when making movies were a fun and amateur experience, conducted by people who knew almost nothing about making\na movie yet they managed to create stories, become a little famous and improve each movie went by, without attending film schools or anything. It was all about learning\nas you go, and this is the kind of things that doesn't happen anymore unless if it's some video project here and there, or some group with resources who manage to\nmake their own pieces. This proves a great way that with creativity, enthusiasm and a passion one can find the ways and means to make their own art. It's inspiring all that much. 8/10."]},

Here's a few of them: a young man (Fábio Porchat, the comedian's father and the resemblance is uncanny) has a vivid nightmare of a naked woman (Annik Malvil) on a\nbeach who presents historical facts from the early 20th Century and how they could possibly be the beginning of a potential 3rd World War; an old businessman\n(Jofre Soares) panicks about the plane going down; a nun (Talula Campos) questions about God and her devotion to Him and the church, making a series of\nphilosophical questions. At times, there's some small interactions on the plane, mostly related with the men's desire for the beautiful advertising girl\n(Karin Rodrigues) or some talks about a soccer player problematic deals.", "The problems are everywhere. As people embarking on the same voyage they don't interact much with each other, and when they do it's all empty conversations\nwith no depth. And when the plane finally gets where it needs, some of the characters simply disappear from view and we didn't even know why that trip was so important. As they\nimmerse themselves in their own little worlds, the chaos and confusion is rampant with a downer mixture of literature and magazine references that only keeps on\ncomplete doubt about the meaning of life, the obsession for consumerism and the hopelessness of it all. No solutions were given neither some theory as to how\nthose men and women will go on with their lives.", "I think Campos tried too much, succeed it very little with all this existential quest. When Bergman or Tarkovsky does that, they reach something and they give\nus some breathing space rather than just throwing and spewing words after words that one can't find ways to pause, make a reflection and move on. I won't complain\nabout the editing, the images (there are amazing archive images and the collage between them are superb) neither the use of many Caetano Veloso songs, that add\nsome humor and some idealism coming from the counterculture of the period. But, sadly, I felt lost and confused for most of the time, and didn't get a higher\npersepctive to the hopes and fears of those characters. I might be wrong, maybe one day I might return to it and find something special there. For the time being,\nit stays as a disappointing effort that had a nice material but just wasn't well connected. 3/10."]},

This almost cynical disregard for respecting the author's true vision of his own work is pretty sad, as every nuance of Huxley's story has its meaning and characters stomped upon with references to rave culture, soap opera scandal type revelations and media blitz culture. The video and vocal overlays that are supposed to drive us through the films locations....superfluous. THe concepts of life inside the Brave New World become so much pseudo intellectual rambilng, the characters merely philosophical mouthpieces. If I didn't know any better I would have thought this film was French in origin. One can almost sense a level of shame being heaped upon us, the viewers as if this is the world we want and the writer and director know what we WILL become in the future. How odd.

Southfork is decidedly empty these days, and having Sue Ellen living back there at all and on (almost) friendly terms with J.R. is, to my mind, stretching credibility to the limit, even by the standards of U.S. soaps.

Even today, that title demands attention (likewise, today most mainstream distributors would still opt for the less salacious subtitle). The trailer is equally titillating, opening with scenes of the star, Libertad Leblanc, being raped, followed by a shapely stripper strutting her stuff as a female voice invites us to \"Come to the Pink Pussy—where SIN lives!\" Based on the trailer alone, I was sold on this Venezuelan import with its promise of sex, crime, murder, and fights in a sky cable car, made extra spicy with some 1966 shot-in-New York footage of stand-ins enacting what director Alberto Dubois could only hint at in 1964.", "And \"The Pink Pussy\" delivers all that, but most of it is delivered in the third act. The trailer leaves out all the driving around Caracas, the singing, and the obnoxious children that fill out its first two acts, and with good reason. Not only is it not what the target audience would want to see, these elements act as big, chassis-bending speed bumps to what should be a rollicking thrill-ride of a story, about an \"American\" singer, Mara (Leblanc), who signs a contract to perform at the Pink Pussy nightclub in Venezuela only to encounter one misfortune after another: her contract is fake; her jewelry and passport stolen; no one will give her a job; and just when it seems like things couldn't get worse for our heroine, she's kidnapped and raped. Luckily, Alex, a suave older gentleman (and, unbeknownst to Mara, a local crime lord), comes to her rescue, not only wrapping his coat around her and giving her a ride back to her hotel but securing for her a valid contract at the Pink Pussy. Elvira, Alex's cokehead ex-girlfriend, is none too pleased about being kicked to the curb and is determined to disrupt Alex's and Mara's very slow-burning relationship, which appears to be pretty much transportation-oriented as Alex does little more than drive Mara to and from her hotel. Further complicating matters is Mara's growing attraction to Ernesto, who is also smitten by the hapless \"American.\"", "Leblanc is shapely and pleasant looking, and though New York stand-ins provide most of the skin she does get naked on the beach with a fully-clothed Ernesto. Unfortunately, her hairstyle is a bit distracting, being reminiscent of the awful wig Chesty Morgan wore in \"Deadly Weapons.\" At times her acting is also reminiscent of Chesty Morgan, though Leblanc is usually adequate in her role. The actress playing Elvira (Eva Moreno), on the other hand, is a far livelier presence with her seething, shouting and screaming. She's not on screen nearly enough. Not only would beefing up her role treat us to more of Moreno's hysterical performance, it would have really beefed up this movie as well, something the filmmakers seemed to have realized too late as Leblanc is quickly pushed aside in favor of giving the grand finale to Moreno.", "Sin does indeed live at \"The Pink Pussy,\" but expect to wait in the bar awhile before it finally gets home. If you don't have the time, just seek out the trailer instead, which, as is so often the case, succeeds in being far more entertaining than the actual movie."]},

The characters were well developed, individual, and full of potential and humanity.  The relationships were actual and realistic, a wonderful break from the Fantasy of Sleepless in Seattle (or You've Got Mail, pick the title you want).  The presentation of people with problems and realistic responses to these problems and the people who are affected by these problems really makes this movie more than a past-time; it is a gift, showing us what we are and what we can become with some work and maybe a small paradigm shift.", "\nEveryone did a wonderful job of presenting real people, Sean Connery found a role which allowed him to be his age but not loose that which he is loved for: sinful good looks and flawless composure. Gillian Anderson was so good that by the end I had almost stopped waiting for Molder to arrive. But for me Angelina Jolie was the centerpiece, as she showed the greatest degree of development and growth, epitomizing the struggle that each person was going through.", "To me, the plot was a lot more complicated than just the feelings that develop from watching the movie, and the depth of perception is honestly presented in the comments of the other reviewers; most seem to have watched the movie with so much intensity that they got up 35 minutes into it to go and tell the popcorn boy to give them a new bag because they had specifically asked for NO butter.  This movie is cognitive to the degree it is affective.  It takes one relationship and divides it up into several stages (seen as the family members' relationships), and in doing so it allows us to see relational development in ways we normally can't, just as we repeatedly see the time of day change against the buildings.", "\nIt is funny, it is romantic, but it is true. And I am thankful for its gift of sight: into life, into death."]},
