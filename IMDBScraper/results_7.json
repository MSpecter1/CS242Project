Bugs Bunny is one of my favourite characters in animation and ever and Mel Blanc was one of the greatest voice actors ever.", "'How Bugs Bunny Won the West' is not bad at all though, if slightly too slight and episodic in story, with it basically a series of cartoons that fits a theme.

If more in the featured cartoons edited in than in the additional scenes. The music is lively enough and doesn't sound too cheap in the additional scenes, while being outstanding in orchestration and how it adds to and enhances the action in the featured cartoons.", "All the characters featured are always worth watching, and that's an understatement, being widely considered classic characters in animation and ever more than justifiably. Mel Blanc shows a mastery of bringing individuality to multiple characters that few others managed, being the heart and soul. The dialogue is sharp and witty and the gags are fast paced, beautifully timed and animated and very funny. Most of the characters are not wasted at all, Bugs and Daffy are especially well handled.", "The classic era cartoons featured are colourful and are amusing to hilarious, with great dialogue and gags and iconic characters not wasted at all, they fit with the theme too, and like to love most of them. Though too many of them are on the too short side and a few are introduced and rounded off in a slightly jarring way.", "Overall, decent. 7/10 Bethany Cox"]},

Yes Dany Carel and Bernard Blier shine in a couple of Audiard trademark rants. Yves Robert is great also in another scene, but this one was actually in the book and is only a rare example of a fine adaptation work in the movie.", "Indeed these Audiard rants are simply out of pace in an already badly paced adaptation. The first few scenes, actually a narration disjointed in vignettes, introducing Goubi before he goes to Paris, are just a total failure. They miss the point of setting the countryside reference to the journey. Ironically Yves Robert is around for a couple of minutes as I mentioned, and he did know how to shoot the countryside to express what makes people free and happy there. As such the movie starts off with the ideas that countrymen are restless thick people whereas the point of the story is showing a poor naive character lost in the frantic Parisian merry-go-round.", "Serge Korber was never a good director either, and yet he was handed material with potential, starting with this movie and ending with vehicles for top stars de Funès and Girardot - which bombed, prompting a somewhat disillusioned porn stint. The young director's assignment excuse doesn't stick since his name is listed as a writer too. A good example of a poor director's job is how Korber directed André Pousse in his debut as a rude cab driver. Audiard had chiselled a fine rant for his friend, the monologue is funny, but Pousse is simply given too little direction to make this look good.", "Above all most of the harm comes from casting Jean Lefebvre as the lead. Whoever pushed the idea forward simply didn't understand that playing a dumb character requires a very talented actor (think Rain Man, Forrest Gump), not just one that already looks dumb. Bourvil comes to mind here but he was certainly too expensive. Fernandel was too old but the part here is not too dissimilar to the one he had in Le Schpountz - an obvious reference in the novel when Parisians on holiday talk Goubi into believing he would be a sensation at the Olympia concert hall.", "It is difficult to recommend this movie. You can enjoy the best parts elsewhere, yet these Audiard tidbits do little if anything to lift the movie out of its utter mediocrity. To see Bernard Blier, Dany Carel wasted in this missed opportunity is really painful as the story hops along with other fine supporting characters including Yves Robert, Jean Carmet, André Pousse and Pierre Richard."]},

He later also executes the title song \"Yeh Jawani\" in his unique comic style (Kishore was said to have the unique ability to put himself right in the shoes of the actor for whom he was doing the singing). However, it is the combination of Kishore with Asha on \"Aa Jane Ja\" that creates one of the most memorable songs of Indian cinema. The picturization of the song is perfect, there is a sense of mystery in both the setting, the voice and the music. This one song will keep on ringing in your ears long after hearing it and, to my knowledge, is being remixed now over and over again by so many.", "In so far the plot is concerned, this is the simple story of boy (Randhir Kapoor) meets girl (Jaya Badhuri) at school, with the usual problems with parents. However, the acting is great. A special note goes to the great Satyen Kappu who gives, in my opinion, his most comical performance ever (as the DJ friend of Randhir Kapoor) in two scene-stealing pieces: first, when he impersonates Randhir Kapoor's father to meet the boy's teacher, and later when he meets Jaya's father.", "In short, you have here everything that a great Indian movie is made of: a good story, very good acting and excellent music."]},

I think part of its appeal is that it's a darker comedy, like \"Heathers\"--though this movie certainly isn't in the same league. Everybody in the cast gives fine performances. Rose McGowan's is a little over-the-top, but I think it fit the tone of the movie. The running time is about 85 minutes, so it doesn't go on long. There are plenty of funny moments that keep it entertaining. You can argue that the Karen Carpenter joke was too cruel, but that joke alone didn't ruin the film for me. The ending is certainly a cop-out. There could've been a MUCH better pay-off! But despite the fact that \"Jawbreaker\" is undoubtedly a flawed film, it's energetic and fun. There are much worse teen movies out there."]},

He awakens to a special alarm clock that activates his home stereo system, waking him to his favorite music. Along the way, Bill looks at photographs of his deceased wife, who apparently used to be part of his act. After breakfast, Bill goes to the supermarket, driving his unique classic automobile, a meticulously preserved 1930s model Pierce-Arrow; he compulsively takes two orange parking cones out of the trunk and places them in the two parking spaces next to his, to block anybody from parking near his car. Inside the market, Bill interacts in a friendly way with two employees, charming them with a magic trick.", "Kate (", ") is a young teenage girl who is in a domestic squabble with an intimidating man named Demesta (", "). Kate, who is apparently nude and is wrapped in a towel, has locked herself in a bathroom to hide from Demesta, who pounds angrily on the door and demands to know the details of a drug deal that Kate has fouled up. He screams at her to give him either his money or his drugs. Frightened, Kate escapes through the bathroom window, still wrapped only in a towel, while a policeman suddenly knocks on the front door of the apartment and grapples with Demesta. The policeman chases Demesta down the street while Kate goes in a different direction, slipping down over a hillside staircase and losing her towel in the process. She runs away totally nude.", "Bill comes out of the grocery store talking to the bag boy about magic tricks, but when he opens his trunk to replace his orange parking cones, they both see Kate lying naked in his trunk, covered only in a deflated tire tube. Stunned and suddenly in a very compromising position (with a naked teenage girl in his trunk), Bill convinces the bag boy that it was just an illusion and he drives away. He stops on a secluded side street to question Kate, who asks Bill to take her to his house. He reluctantly agrees.", "Bill tries to get Kate to tell him what's going on, but she avoids all his questions, telling him crazy things like that her parents died on the Titanic and that she has no last name. Bill responds sarcastically to her jibes, but he also does his best to help Kate with whatever trouble she may be in. Instead of going to the police, he allows her to take shelter in his home, allowing her to choose some of his clothes to wear and even altering them so they fit her better. Kate refuses to answer any of his questions, and she attempts to escape Bill's house by dropping out of an upstairs window, spraining her ankle in the process. This attracts the attention of Bill's neighbors, Stan (", ") and Sue (", "), a nosy couple who try and figure out who the strange girl is at Bill's house.", "Bill goes to visit his friend Max (", "), who is a resident of a nursing home. Max apparently lived with Bill before being confined to the facility due to his despondent condition; Max has retreated into his mind and hasn't spoken a word in years, refusing to react to external stimulus. Bill still makes a habit of visiting him daily, cheerfully telling him about everything that's going on. He tells Max about Kate, saying that he feels as if he has to help her, although he doesn't know how. Later, Bill also receives a visit from his daughter, Shirl (", ") and her husband, Harris (", "). Shirl feels Bill is becoming senile and she tries to get him to sign a document that will give Shirl control over his bank account; when Bill refuses, Shirl becomes furious, complaining that Bill is giving away all of his money, but Bill angrily rebuffs her.", "Meanwhile, Demesta is in a rage about Kate's betrayal. He questions Roy (", "), a teenage friend of Kate's, in an intimidating way and tells him that he'll find Kate wherever she is. When Bill goes to get a prescription for painkillers refilled, Demesta sees him in the pharmacy, but is unaware that he is connected to Kate.", "Stan and Sue step up their interfering and call Shirl to tell her they saw a young girl in Bill's house. When Shirl returns, she demands to see Kate but Bill refuses to let her in the house. He also refuses to acknowledge that he's harboring a juvenile, denying anything is wrong, much to Shirl's dismay and fury. Shirl suggests to Harris in a private moment that her father has been unstable ever since his vaudeville career went bad, identifying a disatrous show in Pittsburgh as the turning point. Harris thinks Shirl just misunderstands Bill, and encourages her to accept Bill's eccentric ways.", "Bill and Kate have a conversation where she reveals to him that she's on the run from a drug dealer. She claims Demesta gave her money to make a connection and pay for a cache of product, which she then threw into a sewer in a moment of panic. Bill tells her to go to the police, but Kate is afraid to do this because of the consequences for herself. Bill is happy that Kate has opened up to him finally; he genuinely likes her and feels that she has never had a nurturing home, being shuttled between foster homes. He invites her to come live with him, but Kate tells him that one has to be a certain age to be a foster parent. \"I'm not old enough?\" he jokes.", "Bill's poker buddies, whom he calls the \"No Shirt Gang\", all arrive to play cards at Bill's house, and he introduces Kate to them. They promise to be discreet about her presence, and the evening is interrupted when Shirl makes good on her promise to return with the police. The No Shirt gang hides Kate with a magic trick, levitating her up to the ceiling. When the girl can't be found, Shirl is even more furious.", "The next day, Bill leaves for his daily visit to Max, and he has a conversation with Kate, explaining Max's situation to her. Kate feels as if Max may need some tough love, recalling a young boy she once knew who also refused to talk. Kate tells Bill that the boy started talking once all the other kids ignored him. When Bill visits Max, he tells Max that he will never come to see him again; unless Max talks, it's goodbye forever. As a result, Max breaks down and begs Bill not to leave, and they embrace. Bill returns to the house excitedly to tell Kate the good news, but he finds that Kate is gone and the house is empty. Bill is despondent.", "Meanwhile, Kate returns to her foster home and gets a few of her belongings. She meets up with Roy at school, and Roy warns her that Demesta is looking for her. Then Kate reveals what really has her scared: she never made the connection in the first place, and still has the $20,000 cash that Demesta gave her to pay for the drugs. Roy is shocked and tells Kate that Demesta will kill her if he finds her, but Kate plans to leave town with the money. When Roy tells Kate that Demesta has been questioning everybody about Bill, Kate is horrified that Demesta knows where she was hiding, and that any moment now he will track down Bill's house and confront him.", "She returns to Bill's house, unable to leave town without making sure her new friend is aware of the danger he's in. While she is there, Demesta forces his way into the house; Kate has the $20,000 in her teddy bear, but she and Bill manage to subdue Demesta. After a chase through Bill's house, Bill holds Demesta at bay with a sword, forcing him into a large bag covered in padlocks. When they have him incapacitated, Bill reveals that the sword is a fake, one of Max's props from his magic act.", "With the police summoned and Demesta arrested, Bill and Kate celebrate by drinking tomato juice. Shirl arrives and is terrified when she sees the police at Bill's house, but Bill talks to her about the strange events that have been going on. Then he asks Shirl a favor.", "We then see Bill back at the rest home; Max is packing his belongings, preparing to go back home with Bill. Bill explains that Shirl and Harris have agreed to act as foster parents for Kate, and that Kate will stay with Bill and Max on the weekends. The film ends as Bill and Max walk out to greet Kate, who is guarding Bill's car by making sure nobody parks near it."]},

The Man himself Mr. Feroz Khan,the undisputed king of Curry Westerns.Here he finally gets to play out a full fledged Indian interpretation of Mr. Clint Eastwood's character from Sergio Leone's Dollar Trilogy.He's a nameless,smooth talking,no-nonsense gunfighter clad in a black poncho out for revenge against Jhanga.Quite a few elements are \"borrowed\" from For A Few Dollars More(1965).Mr. Khan's theme,the pocket watch motive and the settling of accounts in the village circle are all here but they are Indianized and that's where this film scores. Also it's full of humour with all the five city thugs(who usually played villains)adjusting to the village life n' customs creating some hilarious situations.All in all one of the best Curry Western's ever made and it predates Sholay!"]},

This same channel showed other late 1960s and early 1970s French Canadian films which I decided to tape. I must say I loved them all: \"Loving and Laughing\" and \"Love in a Four Letter World\" being the best of the bunch. The others included \"Valerie\", \"The Awakening\" and \"Two Women in Gold\". \"Love in a Four Letter World\" is about a family (husband,wife and daughter) who have become disillusioned with one another. The father has an affair and his daughter catches him in the act. She has already hooked up with the neighbouring free-love hippies who live next door. When her mother realizes her love has gone out the door she too travels next door for some lovin. This movie leans more on the serious side and can not be considered a comedy. \"Loving and Laughing\" is about an upper-class, young man named Reggie (played by one-time actor Gordon Fisher) who is enlisted to help a family friend's daughter in Vermont learn French over the summer. The only problem is that Reggie's car dies on the way south and he is then taken on by a travelling group of hippies escaping the law. Reggie is the straight-laced type who at first interacts rather uneasily with his hippie counterparts. But soon he learns to bond with his new friends and actually becomes a leader in their commune. The former leader of the commune is played by the great Andre Lawrence (of \"Love in a Four Letter World\" fame). His name is Luciean Leplame- a wanted drug infringement criminal. Both he and Reggie hatch a plan to cover up their tracks. Soon Lucien is headed for Vermont instead of Reggie to teach French lessons. The fun is only just beginning for both young men. There is lots of nudity in this film and some subtle slapstick as well. I would consider this movie a comedy for sure. The only real drawback with this film and the others (especially \"Love in a Four Letter World\") would have to be what appears to be voice-overs. In reality, the voices are the actual actors voices (in English) but the tracking is a bit off. AS well, the actors voices don't seem to be presented in a proper acting tone. They seem to be very loud and over-the-top. I wonder if this was done for a reason? Anyway, for me, the scripts in all of them are wonderful and the lines have a deeper meaning than the actual acting. Just listen to the words that are spoken to Susan Haven in \"Love in a Four Letter World\" to her dad when she catches him cheating on his wife, or the words spoken at the end of this movie when a local spiritual preacher on the streets of Montreal is talking to some locals. Great stuff!!"]},

Although I was born a year after this was released, I grew up seeing this on our television along with the other 90s flicks. I knew it was a cult classic but I never really remembered what it was about. In celebration of Peque Gallaga's life, I jumped at the chance to watch it again on iWant. I'm telling you, I was captivated at the first minutes. In an instant, I got transported back to the days where my cousins and I would watch movies at the Cinema One early in the morning. But more than the nostalgia, I was amazed how well-made it was. The music was so moving! Cinematography was therapeutic. And the writing was truly comforting. I just think that some action sequences were too dragging and that it lost its momentum several times in an effort to expand the world. Nevertheless, it's a landmark film through and through! I'm just utterly sad because they don't make it now like they used to!", "Today, the Philippine mainstream cinema is flooded by stories of teenage romance, adult crisis, and mindless comedy disguised as family movies. A futile attempt in one size fits all approach that continues to kill the audience and paralyze the art of filmmaking. What happened to the stories of the children? We are fond of saying that the children are the future of our country but what can they hope for when their sense of heritage and nationalism are replaced by quick and irrelevant entertainment. How will their creativity get honed when they are dispassionately exposed to technology without a solid root of their homes? I firmly believe that it's high time to revisit what the new generation of young Filipinos are consuming.", "In Magic Temple, we were reminded how we led our lives with strong regard for the Filipino values. We defy anyone who harms our friends or families. Our culture of respect recognizes the differences and acknowledges our shortcomings. Learning is a vital tool in our survival that provides us the experience to champion our struggles. Now, everything is turning blurry. We openly welcome the tyrants in our homes. The sense of unity is nowhere to be found as every Filipino fights for themselves and terrorizes others. Respect is nothing but a strange concept now for many. Clearly, more than building life for the present and future Filipino children, all Filipino adults must look themselves in the mirror and reflect on their own upbringing. Have we lived up to the values of our Magic Temple days? Will Jubal, Sambag, and Omar be proud of how we all turned out? We all once dreamed of an adventure like them and now that we have our own missions to accomplish, we must keep in our hearts all the lessons of wonder and bravery they left us.", "RIP Peque Gallaga."]},

It is a slow paced drama with touches of romance and a bit of fantasy set in a small Swedish town in 1820. The slow way the film carefully unfolds the story is very different from the modern films and has more in common with melodramas of the 60s and 70s. It is definitely an Old School style of film-making that, while at first sight it may seem outdated and slow, it fits perfectly the tone and mood the filmmaker Morten Henriksen wants for his film.", "Based on the novel by Per Olov Enquist, the movie is about the arrival of a mysterious stranger to a small village in Sweden. The stranger, Friedrich Meisner (Ole Lemmeke), claims to be a \"magnetist\", able to cure what medicine can not cure using his powers. Dr. Selander (Rolf Lassgård), the most respected physician in town, is reluctant at first and considers Meisner a fraud, but after witnessing what seems to be a miraculous cure, he decides to take his blind daughter Maria (Johanna Sällström) to see if Meisner can cure her. Dr. Selander's assistant, Dr. Stenius (Gard B. Eidsvold), becomes angered at this decision as he watches a romance in bloom between Meisner and Maria, whom he wants for himself.", "Henriksen takes its time to explore the characters of the story with great detail, but still the movie is never boring or tiresome. His camera-work and overall style of film-making is very reminiscent of the classic European melodramas, but still he has a distinct mark of his own. The movie is a great take on the typical plot of an isolated town turned upside down by a mysterious stranger.", "The acting is mostly good, with Rolf Lassgård giving a great performance as the sympathetic Dr. Selander. His great ability is displayed as he goes from a sheer reluctance to believe in Meisner to a devotion to the man who cured his daughter. Gard B. Eidsvold is great as Stenius, and portrays the bitterness and jealousy of a man obsessed with proving that Meisner is a fraud. However, the true star is Ole Lemmeke as the charming Meisner, a man with a dark past and surrounded by the mystery about his powers, but who can't help but falling in love with the Doctor's daughter.", "Despite its apparent low budget, the movie looks very good and really captures the feeling of an old town in North Europe. The cinematography may not be as lucid as in other films, but still makes every frame as beautiful as a postcard and it makes the best of its snowed locations.", "Probably the main flaw of the movie is a the same its major merit, its slow pace and rhythm may turn off viewers not used to this kind of movies. However, it makes a very rewarding experience as the plot is captivating and very well constructed. Also, I have read reviews stating that Johanna Sällström's performance is the weakest link in the cast; I think she did a good job although it is true that she is overshadowed by her counterparts.", "To summarize, \"The Magnetist's Fifth Winter\" is a movie unlike most modern melodramas. It is done in an old school style that is rarely seen these days. While its slow pace may be a turn off to many, I think this movie is an overlooked gem and one of the best Swedish films of the 90s. 8/10"]},

The bad news is that Vivid, on its way from being Adult Cinema's top label to a whimpering death 16 years later (today it is merely a lameduck arrow in web pornographer Bree Mills' quiver), saw fit to ruin the movie just a couple of years later, cutting out 1/3 of its running time in transitioning from VHS to DVD format. (IMDb insists on displaying 78 minutes as the original running time: Wrong and seemingly impossible to fix!)", "The original's two hours of action had four sex scenes dropped and numerous characters jettisoned. The thinking, which has become dominant in porn by now, is that viewers expect and require nothing more than sexual stimulation from Adult Cinema, and anything approaching storytelling or involvement with characters is a waste of time.", "This explains why pornographers who fluorished during the VHS era, say for example Michael Zen, Michael Ninn or Michael Raven were soon headed for early retirement. And even Paul Thomas, Vivid's wonder boy, days were numbered as increasingly his work veered toward all-sex junk in the 21st Century.", "The original VHS \"Mission: Erotica\" stands up well thanks to that great cast, even though I have recently seen it sloughed off by barbarians as \"Asian girl porn\" by clowns who reduce all Adult content to crude stereotypes. Yes, Vivid girls Kobe Tai and Asia Carrera have the lead roles and run with them.", "Seeing the movie for the first time at this late date (2022), I was enthralled by the quality performances and the conceit that one cannot know for sure who are the bad guys (and gals) or who are the good ones. Kobe and Asia are on conflicting trajectories, with Asia the big cheese at a government spy agency seemingly up to no good, or is it really a watchdog? Kobe is an action anti-heroine, subjected to manipulation but emerging as a timely La Femme Nikita figure, oddly presaging one of the better inheritors of that mantle, namely Maggie Q's TV incarnation.", "Supporting cast is terrific, ranging from superstar Missy and in a key pair of roles her hubby Mickey G, to some of the best performers of the day: Chloe, Stephanie Swift, Heather Hunter and Sindee Cox."]},

This is basically an educational short where the viewer learns about the various rules of the sport as the narrator explains them while we see reenactments. MODERN FOOTBALL got a lot of media attention when it was bought at a Kansas City flee market nearly fifty-years after it was last seen. The discover of any lost film is always a great thing but sadly the film itself really isn't all that memorable. In fact, if this thing wasn't directed by Altman then there really wouldn't be much to talk about. I've read several reviews where people thought Altman's touch was all over this and I've read how you can see certain techniques here that would appear in later films. I personally didn't see any of this with the brief exception of characters being introduced and eventually coming together. For the most part I found this short to be rather boring but perhaps this was mainly due to me already knowing the rules of football. At such a long running time I just didn't think it was entertaining enough to really work so perhaps those unfamiliar with the sport might get more out of it. It's certainly well shot and edited so the director at least showed he could do this type of thing."]},

Bhagyaraj created a rage with this sentimental tale sprinkled with doses of humour of a widower caught in the line of seduction and celibacy. Parimalam (Urvasi) is a notorious prankster creating a variety of mischiefs along with her gang, which often end up in the village court. Bhagyaraj enters the village with his infant child to take up the vacant teacher post in the local school, but isn't spared from Parimalam's pranks upon his arrival. He takes up the job with one hand holding the book, and the other rocking the cradle in the classroom much to the amusement of local folk in the village. Parimalam's playful nature transforms into love when she learns that he's a widower. She tries many ways to win the teacher's heart, but fails every time. The teacher believes that a stepmother would not take care of his child, and thus even rejects the offer to marry his dead wife's sister. As a last hope to attain him, Parimalam blames the teacher for molesting her and even swears on it by crossing over his child in front of the village court. Petrified, and with the whole village surrounded, he's left with very little option than to marry her. But vows never to touch her and remain in celibacy. But Parimalam doesn't give. She relentlessly tries to seduce him by unconventional methods that prove to be testing times for the teacher. With the chances of winning him slowly decreasing, Parimalam comes to a conclusion once and for all Hailed as one of India's premium screenplay writers, K.Bhagyaraj narrates the story with flowing visuals. The producer A.V.M. Saravanan confessed that Bhagyaraj's 2 hour story narration to him was the best ever he heard from any director. It's hard to believe this being Urvasi's debut film. She effortlessly dons the role of a notorious girl and changes gear to a sensitive wife quite brilliantly. The film ended up with a celebrated 25-week run in theatres and turned out to be one of Bhagyaraj's biggest hits in his career. With its perfect blend of humour and melodrama, and supported by good performances this is a must see if you're in mood for a good laugh."]},

And plenty more besides! The scene where she leaves her baby in the woods coming as it does at 65 minutes in is pretty harrowing stuff, she takes the easy solution but finds almost instantly it was the wrong one and ultimately nearly impossible to live with. On the other hand her ex's original decision to walk out and marry another is not considered as inherently wrong and is something he could live with. There's all kinds of social, political, religious and personal commentaries going on, too many to mention – the previous excellent comment covered it all well – and everything dovetails at the end to a fairly logical conclusion. The only minor niggle I ever had was that no matter how logical the last section dragged on for far too long. The songs were by Vayalar and M.B Shreenivasan, my favourites being Braahmama Muhoortham, entrancingly sung by Manoharan; and the beautiful Chandrothsavathinu sung by Yeshudas with an unusual middle section by Manoharan seldom looked more exquisite or regal, the whole song being a a wondrous piece of poetic sound and vision. I do confess to preferring happy songs with no dark clouds! All the leads seem incredibly photogenic with some marvellous photography and generally excellent production values; in fact some of the sets and costumes would have looked gorgeous in colour. Lakshmi's anguish was perfectly portrayed, especially with Yeshudas' Mounanghal Paadukayo – how is it she never achieved wider recognition? Although filmed a couple of generations ago now, the concepts and lessons of To Err Is Human that are expounded are sadly still to be learnt today by huge sections of humanity."]},

It seems like the director ended up a male chauvinistic figure. I think there was a caste angle to the story which was not explored further. Acting wise, Vinod Mehra gives the best performance of the lot with a subtle and dignified role. He was one of the finest actors in supporting roles. Mithun was good especially in the emotional scenes and his chemistry with Tanvi Azmi is really nice. If only his charcater was not so uni dimensional and problematic. Tanvi Azmi gives a really nice performance on her debut. Padmini Kolhapure doesn't have anything to do in the first half and she appears to be a dumb glam doll but in the second half she appears to be the only sensible character in the film where others fell prey to patriarchal cliches she appears to be the voice of reason and is able to stand against his own husband to secure marriage between Vinod Mehra and Tanvi. Shakti Kapoor and Deven Verma are adequate even though unnecessary comic scenes hampers the flow of the film and action scenes were also not required. Music is pathetic to say the least.

Performances are convincing throughout, with relative newcomer Muramatsu more than keeping up with the more experienced Hiroyuki Sanada, who plays Yuki's love interest Eiji.", "Where the movie does stumble badly is with its bear. Actually, it's less of a stumble, and more of a head-first fall off the edge of a mountain. Wherever possible, footage of a real bear is used, but all too often Chiba is forced to resort to a stand-in, a man in a really unconvincing bear costume, which is hard to take seriously. If only they had found a more realistic solution to the bear problem, I suspect that the film might have been better received.", "6/10. Worth watching to see just how bad the fake bear is, and for cutie Muramatsu stripping down to a skimpy outfit to lure the creature to its doom."]},

This version is also available for streaming on some platforms.", "Edited into ", " (2007)", "Whether it's among the Flesicher Brothers' best is up for debate, but it does have some significance for being the first telling of the Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer story on screen and it is difficult to resist it really. It is in the shadow of the classic 1964 version and is not quite as good, but that means no disrespect because it is a winner on all levels. The animation is so beautifully done, you can tell from the very first moment that it is Fleischer Bros animation. The backgrounds have a lot of fluidity, the character designs are appealing at least and the colours are warm and vibrant and gets even more so as Rudolph The Red Nosed Reindeer(1948) progresses. The music is very lushly orchestrated performed just as much by the orchestra and the chorus singing for the title song brings such a nostalgic warmth, a refreshingly different way to a song that is often jazzed-up or played on the piano(not a problem at all). The introduction section of the title song has rarely been more beautifully sung than here, some may find it mushy and saccharine depending on tastes considering as it has been done in a more accessible way since and that's understandable, with me it's one of my personal favourite renditions of the song(which is one of the catchiest, most instantly recognisable and all-time great festive songs). The narration is written and voiced with dignity and knowing, and the storytelling has all the elements of this well-known story and does it with so much heart-warming charm and poignancy, also wisely doing it in a simple but never simplistic way. Rudolph always has been a relatable character and he is here, you feel for him as he's bullied and you cheer when he overcomes what he's been through, which is why this cartoon and the story is and can be seen as an inspiration. If you've ever been bullied you'd understand completely and also if you haven't but know or have seen anybody go through it. All the other characters, especially jovial Santa, are engaging as well. In conclusion, a beautiful and inspiring cartoon that deserves to be better known, that it's not quite in the same class as the 1964 classic shouldn't be a detriment. On a brief note, some may have seen it for the first time as a fan of Fleischer animation, my case was somewhat unusual in that the cartoon was used to accompany the song Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer(in a different and not as nice rendition) in Very Merry Christmas Songs in the Disney Sing Along series, despite the fact that- as later found out- that it wasn't Disney. That over, from personal rating this rates 10/10. Bethany Cox"]},

This film has a few nice things going for it but not the items you might expect. Payne, before becoming a star, manages to be pretty good here even if his line reading is a tad bit hollow. The rodeo stuff is rather bland as we've seen the stunts done various times before and there's really nothing new added to them here. Where the film does succeed is with the music, which includes tracks such as 'Yankee Doodle', 'Oh! Susanna', 'The Good Old American Way' and a couple others.

Bapu with his genius creativity has taken this epic in the most simplest way possible with a awesome narration. To understand the epic the movie is to be seen. the performances of the Shobhan Babu (Rama in the movie) and Ravana (SV Rangarao) are simply outstanding. Watch this movie for its direction and performances by the above mentioned actors. Rama who was the incarnation of Lord Vishnu comes to earth with the intention to kill Ravana the demon king of Lanka. Rama gets married to Seetha. On the day of his Pattabhishekam ceremony unfortunately he has to leave the Kingdom of Ayodya and goes for Vanavasam along with Seetha and Lakshmana(Brother of Rama). during the vanavasam period Seeta was abducted by Ravana the king of Lanka, How Rama gets his wife back is the rest of the story. Indian Epics with great spirit are far superior than any other epic in the globe."]},

Its concept is clever and the episode ideas are frequently intriguing, but it suffers from poor execution and from literally being a vehicle for its star. I find myself watching it just to see how they screw up great themes.", "EXECUTION: The series characters are more like caricatures. The security chief of this super-secret US project is barely competent and frequently childish. (More caricatures below.) The show is filled with unexplained \"conundrums\". For instance, what happens to the seven-days-ago Parker when the current one \"backsteps\"? I've seen perhaps 20 episodes, and I don't recall any attempt to explain this. The explanations they do give really make you appreciate Star Trek writers' efforts to make sense (or at least to be self-consistent in their nonsense). And many episodes require absurd events in order to reach their inevitable resolutions. The Secret Service accidentally leaves behind the man with the President's nuclear \"football\". Parker impresses Vancouver citizens and police with his *American* NSA badge. (The X-Files-like location overlay says Vancouver is in \"British, Columbia\", as if it were an area called \"British\" in the state of \"Columbia\", rather than the Canadian province \"British Columbia\".) And that same episode gets the \"Battlestar Galactica\" award for copying the movie \"Run, Lola, Run\", right down to the techno songs!", "STAR POWER: LaPaglia out-Shatners Shatner. This billion-dollar project permanently sidelines its original \"pilot\" because Frank has to do *all* the backsteps. Dr. Olga Vukavitch constantly bounces between cold-shouldering Parker's advances and demonstrating unreasonable and unprofessional jealousy. (Justina Veil must have cringed her way through the series with the erratic and silly behavior her storylines required.) Every woman Parker encounters is madly attracted to him. And Parker *always* solves the problems; no other character is permitted to make a meaningful contribution. (One exception: when Donovan quits Backstep and Parker retroactively tries to convince him that's he's important. But it was hard to pay attention to the Donovan character in this episode -- I kept seeing actor Don Franklin instead, trying to make something of the pitiful bone the writers tossed him, probably to keep *him* from quitting.)", "In all, it's fascinating but painful to watch this show flush away the good ideas with such poor writing and directing. I wish Mystery Science Theater 3000 had gotten their hands on this show. They would have made it hysterical instead of pathetic."]},

Realizing a doomed love triangle is repeating itself, they try to stop the actions that originally killed the group from harming each other. Overall, this was quite the enjoyable opener.The fact that it plays with familiar tropes here by featuring the localized version of the Ouija Board makes an identifiable connection to dive into the rest of the story. As the wild sequence displays all the usual attributes from the area around them being affected to the game being obviously manipulated by outside forces with the pieces shown moving about, this here is a fine start to the romantic payoff. The story isn't that interesting or impressive during the flashback moments showing the original characters before the possession of the Independence War-set scenes add no horror to the proceedings. However, it picks up again in the finale to offer some nice visuals through their brawl across the different time-zones. The replication of their events is quite a cliche but is not all too bad of a sequence the way it plays out which makes this a nice introduction piece, and while it's not necessarily the fastest-paced entry for an anthology opener this was enjoyable nonetheless.", "Pridyider-Moving into a new house, a series of strange events and happenings around the central refrigerator causes a teen to believe the object is cursed. As the device starts haunting the family in increasingly deadly manners, they try to stop its evil influence from affecting the family. This was an absolutely spectacular entry. Although the premise might not really support it, there's some absolutely chilling atmosphere derived from the titular device which manages to include a host of shocking flash-jumps to the contents within. From bloodied appendages appearing on the shelves to raspy demonic growling emanating inside and even having the controls move around on their own, this segment generates a fine atmosphere that's all the more chilling once the events start picking up. Taking the time to establish the machines' use and importance to the family, that familiarity and prominence gives way to several chilling attacks that are quite frightening coming from an immobile refrigerator. Despite a languid pace through the investigation scenes that make this longer than it needs to be, this was a really enjoyable segment.", "Manananggal-Traveling to his girlfriends' house, a young man hoping to win her over inadvertently stumbles onto the fact that she's a vicious, winged creature preying on the community. Getting back to the safety of his house, he and the rest of the family must fend off the creatures' attacks. Frankly, this was an enjoyable if slightly flawed finale. When this one works, it's due to the exploitation of the forest setting as there are some utterly chilling and creepy settings that really sell the isolation of their location. The forest around them is rife with thick, densely layered underbrush that's impossible to look deep, which means the scenes of the unearthly roaring and screeches throughout here are just utterly terrifying. Hearing those noises emanate from the deep recesses of the jungle is a truly terrifying setup and the reveal works nicely with that. The last half, which is a series of attacks by the deformed creature has some great moments as it's tearing into the house forcing them to defend themselves and there are some fine attacks here with that. The only real issue is the opening song he tries to sing to win her over, which is a real momentum-killer to start this off with a down-beat intro, but overall it ends this one on an incredibly high note.", "The Bad Stor(ies): None.", "Rated Unrated/PG-13: Brief Nudity, Violence and Language."]},

After all, many of the public domain films on the site have links on IMDb...and I followed the links to the site so I could download the pictures for free. In this case, however, there is no link on IMDb and I found \"Victory of the Faith\" by looking about archive.org. It's certainly NOT a typical film for the site and the story behind it is listed here on IMDb. This is apparently Leni Riefenstahl's first propaganda movie she made for the Nazi party and she would later go on to make the notorious pictures \"Triumph of the Will\" and \"Olympia\"...and effectively curtailed her career because she appeared to be a Hitler-lover. Sure, she later went on to make some small films but her days as a mover and shaker in the industry were gone after the war. Plus, no matter what she later said, she certainly did seem to admire Hitler and did her best to show him and the party in the best possible light! I've seen just about all her other films (including the two others I mentioned) but until I recently found this one, I assumed \"Victory of the Faith\" was a lost film. Read the IMDb trivia to find out how it became 'unlost'! After reading, you'll understand why this copy is a bit poor as well as how historically significant it is.", "What follows is a long and relatively dull film showing the Nazis at their rally at Nuremburg, just after Hitler and the Nazis assumed power over Germany. You'll see a veritable smorgasbord of evil Nazis, though for some reason Heinrich Himler is absent. Additionally, a delegation of Italian Fascists are on hand to sing the praises of Hitler. And, of course, there's Hitler doing what he does best--whipping up the crowds. ", "Much of the film is essentially silent with added martial music. According to the film's intro, Riefenstahl didn't film the events herself but pieced together footage from the German press. Regardless, it's effective propaganda by some evil folks that is mostly of interest to historians or those who are intrigued by Rieenstahl and her sad legacy. Hard to rate...but interesting."]},

Let's face it: this was essentially something produced for a budget of a few thousand bucks by a group of ambitious teenagers a year out of high school themselves. Which makes it both rough and authentic. ", "Jacqueline McKenzie is great fun to watch as the smart sassy bitch slut Pandora, and the other actors in it, albeit less well known, are still believable in their roles. (Richard Bootle as the snarling Sebastian, Tim Hemingway as smartarse Leo, Tina Hoffmann as ingenue Kathy, Graham Wood as big dumb picked-on Simon, and Chris Reynolds as Cassius the teacher-from-hell.) Writer-director-cameraman-editor David W. Williams might have benefited from hiring a script editor- certainly he could have used a sound recordist- but his camera-work and editing is really pretty good, and he writes and directs like someone to watch. He certainly has plenty to say. ", "For me, this movie swings from very good to very bad then very good again. What makes me forgive it- indeed really like it- is the way it puts you back at school, and back in that schooldaze mindset: \"If I don't pass this exam my life will be over!\" That's exactly how it feels to any schoolkid. Powerful stuff."]},

The characters are shallow (particularly Jeanne herself, who is a pretty good indication of what would happen if Lynn Minmay were made a military commander), and their development seems forced. Key moments (such as Bowie and Musica's romance) are flubbed poorly. As for the plot, it was unsatisfying in some ways, particularly at the end of the series. There was no real exploration of who the Zor were and the subplot with the flowers was left unresolved. Hinted romances (between Marie and Charles and Lana and Lt.

The concept was as follows: A mystery guest (still visible to those at home) would be hidden from the view of the panel, who would have to find clues by asking the guest a time-limited selection of questions. Whether or not the guest's identity had been found out, the panel would have the opportunity to interview the guest briefly. Usually each half-hour show consisted of two mystery headlines for the panel to solve.", "The curmudgeonly Gordon Sinclair would always ask the first question, which was always \"How much money do you make?\" Once that was out of the way, it was over to YOU, Betty Kennedy, who filled the chair of glamorous actress Toby Robins later in the life of the show. Betty, herself a real hottie in her youth, could be relied upon to ask hard-hitting journalistic questions like if the guest was married, if they had children, or who was their favorite Beatle. Then Pierre Berton would impress everyone with a smarmy fact he uncovered while researching his latest book, but before he could really get into the interview, the theme music began to play and studio lights dimmed, followed by host Fred Davis' goodbye.", "Speaking of the flavorless host Davis, he appeared only to be there to direct traffic on the show, not impress anyone with his sharp wit, or willowy stage presence. The non-descript show, which was evidently done before a live audience, seemed somehow to have enough relevance to hold the interest of most who tuned in. The impressive mystery guest list included such luminaries as Pierre Trudeau, Malcolm X and Ed Sullivan. Often the guest panelists were quasi-famous Canadian actors, or journalists.", "While Front Page Challenge' production values aimed not to overshadow their famous guests, they probably 'blanded' themselves right out of work. This was a pretty good concept for the late 1950s, but it was really wearing thin by the time it left the airwaves for good in 1995. No matter - by that time it was the longest continually running non-news program in Canadian television history."]},

He eventually gains allies and they all travel together with him to find Reflex Point while sometimes having dangerous skirmishes with the Inbit.", "Sounds good right? Well it's alright to be honest, but could have been a lot better at least in my opinion. The problem I had with this series, and it was a really big problem, was that instead of focusing on plot and story elements, like most series of this nature, a good 80% of the episodes are very episodic based. Meaning, for those that don't know, those episodes don't advance the plot too much at all. There are a few episodes here and there that are story and plot oriented but a majority are about random adventures that have no significance and can easily be done without. I wouldn't say that there is no story but I can say is that the ratio of episodes you need to episodes you don't need is very high. The reason why that's a problem is because the series establishes itself at the beginning as a story based mecha anime series, but as soon as establishing that it ends up turning into a random space and futuristic series that comes on Sci-Fi, and then back into a story based mecha anime series toward the end. Some of the episodic episodes are horribly painful to watch as well. I know I could've finished this series within a weekend but the episodes became chores to watch and felt draining after watching only 1 or 2 episodes.", "There are some good things about this series. The Seiyuus (Japanese voice actors) really play their parts well. They actually helped me to continue watch this series. If it wasn't for Bin Shimada and Hirotaka Suzuoki, I don't think I could've finished this series. The Mecha designs are nice. Though the Legioss is completely ripped-off from Macross' Valkyrie. The Mospeada bikes are great they were very innovative. Same with the music. Though it sounds goofy and dated at first it really fits the mood of the series and is very fitting at all times. And Yellow Belmont's vocal songs are amazing.", "Overall. I really wish that this series wasn't lacking in plot. If it had more of a story then I'd easily love this series but the episode structure and lacking story elements only make this more of a average Real Robot anime series that happened in the 1980's. It's a shame really I was gunning for this series the entire time. I know somebody'll like it though, it just wasn't for me.", "6/10"]},

Of course this is all cliché by now, and some viewers will bemoan that fact and give up right there, but the TV film \"A Change of Heart\" addresses these issues with a lot of forceful emotion and realistic exchanges. There's hurt, and anger, and tears, but it doesn't sink into sap. The male lover isn't given any dimensions--and seems to have a great home of his own, so why were they meeting in a hotel?--and the teenagers involved are tiresomely belligerent, but Jean Smart is the acting centerpiece here and she does the movie a world of good. Her speech to the board of directors where she and her husband work is flawlessly handled, and her bravura spirit at the end will give a lot of viewers hope. A good actress can do that."]},

Other than the similarity in look and title, it has no connection to \"Macross.\" \"Orguss\" was one of the first anime TV series released on video in America (by U.S. Renditions in 1992), although only 17 of the 35 episodes actually got released. ", "\"Orguss\" shows us a future (2062) in which the accidental detonation of a Space Time Oscillation Bomb causes four different parallel universes to overlap. This puts hero Kei Katsuragi, a Japanese space pilot, on an Earth where everything's a little...umm...different. He winds up in the hands of a group of Emaan, a humanoid race dominated by pretty girls (a fact which pleases Kei no end), and finds himself on board a trading ship equipped with powerful fighter craft, including the Orguss, a Macross-like transforming vehicle which Kei pilots and makes his own. The Emaan engage in constant battle with the Chiram, another humanoid race, but with inverted triangles on their foreheads. Kei has a link with two of the Chiram dating back to before the Bomb went off.", " There is some urgency in the plot about the need to restore the dimensional balance and Kei's specific role in the process, but several episodes at a time go by without addressing it. There are all kinds of side trips including a harrowing battle with barbarians from an ancient era who fight on horseback with axes, rocks and bows-and-arrows. At one point Kei and the crew visit an alternate dimension Paris, France to find an oppressed, poverty-stricken people who unite under Jeanne D'Arc to fight Marie Antoinette (and, yes, the \"let them eat cake\" line is voiced, in paraphrased fashion). In between the action, there's plenty of romantic angst on board the ship as a love triangle forms when Kei comes between the pretty young Mimsy and her sullen boyfriend Slay, one of the few men on board.", "It's an exciting series with frequent battles between the Emaan and the Chiram, all expertly designed and staged. The character design is similar to that of \"Macross\"--simple, but effective. The character animation may seem a little stiff in parts, but the mecha action is fluid and plentiful. While the overall character interplay is not as complex as it was in \"Macross/Robotech,\" making this just a tad less dramatically compelling, the series still holds a lot of value for fans of 1980s anime shows. Two of the most important of the \"Macross\" creative team are on board for this one: co-director Noboru Ishiguro and character designer Haruhiko Mikimoto.", "\n\"Orguss 02,\" a sequel, was made ten years later as an equally imaginative six-part OAV (Original Animated Video) series which picks up the story some 200 years later and involves the return of one of the key characters from \"Orguss 1.\""]},

Still, as a viewer commented on the French website Allociné, \"I feel this film does not betray the book.\" Apparently not shown widely or at all in the US. Beautifully done with excellent restraint, true to the book's muted style, a minor triumph for the underwhelming Miller, whose last admired film was The Little Thief/La petite voleuse with Charlotte Gainsbourg in 1988. Tied for Jury Prize at Cannes, nominated for Golden Palm. ", "I wanted to see this because I'd read the book. Easy French. This brought it all back, but wasn't quite as disturbing because you know the fantasies are fantasies, every time. In the book it's from the boy's point of view and you aren't always so sure. Lots of closeups of ven den Bergh's face don't make us see entirely through his eyes. It's all more externalized.

She seems unable to clear herself and matters commence to look black for her. Temple Trask has never seen Helen since their chance meeting on the train, but has continued a search for her. He is amazed to see her picture in the paper as the girl accused of the crime. He is furious and swears the girl is innocent and that he will prove it. He goes to her grandmother's and learns of her old-time quarrel with her grandmother. Failing to secure any help in this direction, he meets with failure after failure to establish her innocence and is about to give up the case when he happens to see a photograph of himself dressed as a girl for some of the college theatricals. This gives him the idea of following the crooks, dressed as a woman. He learns they are taking passage to South America. He is amazed to find that Helen is also on their track. Temple greatly amuses himself at Adrian's expanse and as \"Mrs. Carfax\" plays cards with the crooks, gaining their confidence. At the South American destination, Adrian and Rena and \"Mrs. Carfax,\" now pals, plan all sorts of ways for fleecing their fellow-guests at the hotel until Temple decides he has enough evidence. He plans an interview wherein he will wheedle Adrian into a full confession of the robbery of Helen's grandmother. He arranges with the American consul to be concealed behind a screen. Adrian's confession is recorded by the consul's stenographer. In another moment the handcuffs are on Adrian's wrists and Temple, wig snatched off, is running down the stairs three steps at a time to find Helen."]},

The highlight of the movie is the clarinet played in this movie by the legendary clarinet-player, Ustad Bismillah Khan Saheb. Though bollywood is a never-exhausting treasure of love stories, very few love stories have portrayed the depth of this sublime emotion in such a realistically penetrating way. This outstanding movie pronounces loud and clear that the true love is for the soul and not for the body.", "This is the story of the immortal love of Gopi (Ameeta) and Kishan (Rajender Kumar). Kishan is a clarinet player and learns the same from his Guru, Raghunath Maharaj(Ulhas) whose daughter Ramkali (Anita Guha) has a strange love for him. She knows that Kishan loves Gopi and has complete sympathy for them. Kishan's poverty does not allow him to marry Gopi whose matrimonial alliance is fixed with Shekhar (Pratap Kumar) who does a decent job in the radio station of Lucknow. The exposure of the love of Kishan and Gopi in the village compels Kishan to leave the village but Ramkali being concerned for his well-being, goes alongwith him. Kishan meets Shekhar in Lucknow and starts playing the clarinet on radio. Now he gets name and fame (and money too) but when he returns to get his lost love back, he is shocked to see that Gopi's wedding is taking place with Shekhar (despite herself being in a partially fainted state). Broken-heart Kishan is back now, only to find solace from Ramkali. On the other hand, Gopi has got insentient after separation from Kishan and in such a condition, her maternal uncle(Manmohan Krishna) who has always been sympathetic to her, does not allow her to be sent to her Sasural (in-laws' home). Ultimately she comes to senses by listening to Kishan's clarinet only. But knowing that she is a wedded woman now, she, as per the Indian Samsakaras and traditional norms embedded in her, starts her journey to reach her husband, leaving Kishan behind. However this separation is not acceptable to the souls of these lovers and that forms the climax.", "The movie contains several melodious songs but they are aptly placed and does not block the flow of the story.", "I highlight certain significant plus points of the movie separately :", "1. The complex character of Ramkali (Anita Guha) : Ramkali loves Kishan, that's clear but what's the type of her love ? The director has not replied this question directly and left it for the audience to search an appropriate answer for it. She knows about the love of Kishan and Gopi, yet there is no womanly jealousy on her part. When Kishan is compelled to leave the village, she is so concerned about his welfare that she also runs away with him. People in the village, as expected, tarnish her name and character, linking her relationship with Kishan to the usual male-female sexual relationship. But while living with him (imagine this live-in relationship in India in that period of the fifties), she cares for him like an affectionate mother and supports him like a loving sister.", "2. The climax of the movie : In the climax, when Gopi starts her train journey to reach her husband, leaving Kishan behind, he falls from a hilly point and dies. In the morning when Gopi's husband receives her on her destination station, Lucknow, he is able to receive her dead body only. When he asks her maternal uncle (who was accompanying her) - 'MAMAJI, YE KYA HO GAYA ?' (How's it happened ?), he replies - AATMA JISKI THI, USSE JA MILI, SHAREER TUMHAARA THA, ISLIYE TUMHAARE PAAS PAHUNCH GAYA' (the soul met whom it belonged to, you had a right over the body alone, so the body has reached you). So touching ! ", "3. The music : Bharat Vyas has penned down great lyrics and Vasant Desai has composed great melodies for them based on the Indian classical raagas. Tere Sur Aur Mere Geet, Jeevan Mein Piya Tera Saath Rahe, Ankhiyaan Bhool Gayeen Hain Sona, Dil Ka Khilona Haay Toot Gaya, Keh Do Koi Na Kare Yahaan Pyar etc., are all timeless classic songs and a priceless gift for not only the cine-music lovers but also for the lovers of the Indian classical music.The music of this movie is a part of the rich Indian cultural heritage.", "Performances are simply great. The romantic hero of the fifties and the sixties, Rajender Kumar has done a great job in the role of the Shehnaai-nawaaz (clarinet-player). Ameeta has acted in very few films but this is perhaps the best movie of her career. In the role of first the true lover, then the the girl who has got insentient due to emotional shock and ultimately the married girl mentally bound by her Samsakaraswho knows within her whom she loves but still understands her social duty to move to her husband; Ameeta has delivered a praiseworthy performance. Anita Guha in the difficult and complex role of Ramkali is just superb. Other actors are also perfect.", "The dialogues are also admirable. Ramkali's repetitive monologue - this I know, this I do not know - is quite situational and allows the listener (and the viewer) to have a peep into her heart.", "The cinematography, art direction and other technical aspects of this B&W movie which has a rural backdrop for its major part, are all well-placed. The narrative flows smoothly and able to keep the viewers tied with the moving storyline.", "And finally the enchanting Shehnaai (clarinet) played in the movie by the legend, Ustad Bismillah Khan Saheb which makes this movie all the more special. It is a treat for all the traditional music lovers. Goonj Uthi Shehnaai is for all the people who believe in true love which is for the soul and by the soul."]},

His blonde wife Lissy is much younger, pretty and vivacious. Since Eickmeyer can't keep up with his young wife, he commissions a companion for her in the form of a life-sized talking clockwork man, purchased for 5,000 deutschemarks ... to be shipped to his home immediately it's assembled.", "Speaking of money, Max von Storch is a handsome young baron, noble of title but short of pfennigs.

(We're not told what he does about his toilet needs.) Eventually, of course, the real clockwork man arrives; now the baron abandons his disguise but is unable to leave. Various bedroom-farce complications ensue...", "'Der Hampelmann' is deeply contrived in its situations. So was 'Die Puppe', but that film was set in a fairytale mise-en-scene that blatantly contradicted reality. 'Der Hampelmann' takes place in a somewhat more realistic milieu than Lubitsch's film, so the contrivances are more awkward here. It's worth noting that 'Die Puppe' was a silent film, whilst 'Der Hampelmann' is a talking picture ... and an early one at that, suffering from the unwieldy camera techniques of the time. Silent films had a basic air of unreality that worked very much to the benefit of 'Die Puppe', whereas the guttural voices of the actors in 'Der Hampelmann' keep us grounded in reality. Ossi Oswalda's clockwork doll didn't speak; in 'Der Hampelmann', the mechanical men -- the real one, and the fake -- both speak mechanically, and the effect is not charming.", "In the leading role of the counterfeit clockwork man, Max Hansen gives a lively and extremely physical performance, but fails to ingratiate. The story might have worked better if Baron von Storch had money, so that we would accept that his interest in Lissy -- apparently equal parts lust and romance -- has no mercenary subtext. The best performance in this film is given by Szöke Sakall, better-known to fans of 1940s Warner Bros films as character actor S.Z. Sakall. As the wealthy Eickmeyer, 'Cuddles' Sakall is in fine form here, doing all of his beloved physical crotchets. At one point, he even clasps his fists to his cheeks, as he did so memorably in several Hollywood films. I was also pleased by a too-brief performance by Peter Lorre's wife Celia Lovsky. Less pleasant is this film's musical score, which sounds more mechanical than may have been appropriate for a story about a mechanical man. 'Der Hampelmann' is a very enjoyable film, which I'll rate 7 out of 10."]},

Kalpana's father (Om Prakash) disapproves their marriage but lovestruck Kalpana listens to her heart and marries Rajesh. They start living in a different city and carry on with their conjugal life blissfully. Kalpana gets adjusted to the modest earning and resources of her husband without any complaint and regularly writes letters to her mother that Rajesh is earning well and there is no monetary hardship for them. Within a year of their marriage, Kalpana is blessed with a son. Now comes the comic twist in the tale which leads to a stream of laughters for the audience.", "When Kalpana's parents are informed of her delivering their grandson, they become just too eager to visit their daughter, son-in-law and grandson, forgetting all the erstwhile bitterness in their hearts. They inform Kalpana about their visit to her house. Now Kalpana is in trouble because she had written false things about their financial soundness to her mother in the letter whereas the fact is that still herself and Rajesh are not so well-off. She asks Rajesh to manage a camouflage of affluence through hired items and servant just for a couple of days so that the false impression of their richness on her parents remains intact. Rajesh believes in truth and he straightaway dismisses the idea. When Kalpana remains hell-bent upon going ahead with that idea, Rajesh shows his resentment and leaves the house. Now Kalpana has a new trouble due to the absence of her husband in the house.", "However since her parents have never seen their son-in-law till now, the solution to this problem that illuminates in her mind is to arrange a fake husband the same way she has arranged a fake scenario of affluence in her house. She asks the brother of her friend to pose as her husband in front of her parents and to help her. He agrees. However later, Rajesh realizes that when he loves Kalpana so much, then it's his duty to stand by his wife and he comes back to the house. By that time, the fake husband has already appeared before Kalpana's parents. Now Kalpana asks Rajesh to pose as the newly appointed servant of the house. Rajesh does it albeit with a lot of pout. And this situation in the house triggers a chain of laughter-generating scenes continuing till the climax. Finally, Kalpana's parents come to know the truth and they accept their son-in-law as he actually is.", "Joroo Ka Ghulam has a well-written script that has been equally well-directed on the screen. It's a neat and clean healthy comedy sans any vulgarity or indecency. The story idea itself is good and the director (A. Bhimsingh) has presented it on the screen very well. The negative character of Kalpana's cousin (Ramesh Dev) has been inserted to take the story to its finale which is a bit irritating but can be tolerated as a necessary evil to conclude the story. The story starts routinely but once the first and the most important twist arrives, it takes off like anything and thereafter the audience experiences laughs and laughs only. Now it's upto the viewer whether he prefers to laugh out loud or just keep smiling but the rib-tickling drama continues on the screen.", "It is not a slapstick comedy but a situational comedy. The inherent message silently rendered to the audience is also great that it's no use showing off what you actually are not. Present yourself and your life to the world truthfully. Possession of precious items does not matter, possession of virtues in your personality matters. False pride and fake lifestyle yield nothing in the end. These things are realized by Kalpana (also her parents) in the end and should be taken to heart by the viewers for their own good.", "Technically the movie is good. It's not unduly long either. Dialogs are hilarious and in sync with the comic mood of the movie. Music by Kalyanji Anandji is quite good with the lyrics of Anand Bakshi. The best song is the laughter-provoking song sung by Kishore Kumar - Aaiye Aapko Main Apne Banglay Ki Sair Karaaoon. Among the others songs - Baras Gai Re Taras Gai Re (Lata) and Naino Mein Nindiya Hai Maathe Pe Bindiya Hai (Kishore-Lata) are also quite good to listen (and to watch).", "Fondly known as Kaka, Rajesh Khanna has showcased his comic talent in this movie and underscored that he was apt not only in tickling the hearts of the spectators but also their ribs. He has performed quite naturally without any undue effort and the result is a laugh-riot for the audience. Nanda has played a loving wife as well as a daughter who is not willing to hurt her parents with utmost efficiency. Among others, seasoned actor Om Prakash has delivered a highly comic performance as Kalpana's father and complimented the lead pair in their part very well.", "Joroo Ka Ghulam is a family entertainer and the whole family can watch it together. It may not be a classic comedy but definitely an underrated one which is relatively unknown to today's generation. If you are fed up with mindless and irritating movies shown to you in the name of comedy and willing to relief through watching a clean comedy, then this movie is just for you."]},

The movie begins with a young Sanjay Dutt (still known as \"Sunjay\" in those days) covered with blood, with four bullets in his chest and one in his head, trying to save himself. The rest of the movie lives up to the expectations raised by its catchy prelude.", "Ravi (Sanjay Dutt) and Ranjit (Raj Babbar) are brothers. Ravi is a good-for-nothing without a job and without a purpose in life, Ranjit is a successful lawyer who works for the local don, Velji Bhai (Paresh Rawal). Velji Bhai wants to purchase a piece of land owned by Ustad Ali Mohammed (Alok Nath) at any cost, but the latter intends to use it for building a children's park instead, and thus refuses. When Ravi is sent out by Velji Bhai to persuade Ali Mohammed with violence, he is so impressed by the man's kindheartedness that he starts protecting him instead. Velji Bhai, of course, is furious...", "The story is very similar to that of another movie, Ghulam, made ten years later by Mahesh Bhatt's nephew Vikram Bhatt. Both movies are based on (let's avoid the word \"remake\") Marlon Brando's all-time classic \"On the Waterfront\". Whatever one may think of Bollywood-style remakes, it means at least that we can't complain about a bad story. And indeed, unlike many other Bollywood movies from the same period, Kabzaa is a movie one can watch without ever getting bored: the tempo is decent, drama and action sequences follow each other quickly enough to keep one's thoughts from drifting away. Fortunately, Bhatt refrained from inserting obnoxious comedy elements, and the obligatory love stories are kept to a minimum. Still, it is the actors that make this movie worth watching. Sanjay Dutt, Raj Babbar, Paresh Rawal and Alok Nath all give fine performances. The two female roles, played by Amrita Singh and Dimple Kapadia, add little of value, but at least they don't spoil the movie, which is already an achievement in itself."]},

This time, not only was everything cool-looking, colorful and action packed, but you could relate with the characters!  Sure, Takeshi Hongou brooded over the loss of his humanity after being transformed into a cyborg grasshopper by Shocker (the first show's villains), but there was never really any depth in his character.  On the other hand, Shirou Kazami (the show's hero) was hell bent on wiping out Destron (the show's villains) because they killed his whole family!!!  In my opinion, Kazami has more depth and dimension than the first two Riders ever did!  The same is said for the show's later antihero Riderman, who's basically the Masked Rider equivalent to \"Phantom of the Opera,\" only instead of losing his face and music, he loses his right arm and his old job at Destron!  The conflict between him and V3 is quite intense, and even so, you'll still be attached to both characters!", "Also, not only that, but the show was allowed to develop itself without any inside problems (which plagued the first show), which makes MASKED RIDER V3 one of the more consistent shows!  I'd also suggest skipping over from episode 4 to 41 (the introduction of Destron commander Marshall Armor) for an even more straightforward storyline (and avoid the pointless resurrection of the first two Riders later in the series, which was obviously done for ratings and to keep a franchise going)!", "In summary, MASKED RIDER V3 is indeed one of the best Japanese superhero shows!

I also said that I hoped he'd get back in track soon, to what he does best. \"Life/Drawing\" (or \"Apartment 12\") is a film every fan of the actor's got to watch. Ironically, it is a comedy (with a slice of drama), but it remains far away from the big studios.", "Here they'll find Ruffalo at his best acting qualities; with the show all for himself, the camera right on his head, the simplicity in all its extensionAn actor like Ruffalo looks for movies like this one, about frustrated artists and lonely human beings. This was four years before \"Just like heaven\", but his character also has a breakdown here, and stays in bed watching television and eating ice-cream.", "Other than Ruffalo's fantastic character driven performance as Alex, there's nothing much interesting inside this picture. Directed by a now disappeared (did nothing after this) Dan Bootzin, the piece shows the lives of several person that inhabit the same building. Ray (independent figure Alan Gelfant), the manager who's a sexist scumbag; Sylvia, the crying neighbor who cooks and desperately seeks for love and the new girl Lori (Beth Ulrich), who captures Alex's heart.", "A mysterious tall guy who speaks Spanish is always standing and wandering mumbling things in his own language that try to explain a lot. A prostitute who lives besides Alex goes out every night and does this with a different outfit (nurse, police officer). Bootzin observes quietly, slowly. His camera is omnipresent and not at all ambitious; it lays back, creates the environment, and moves faster in a very funny scene where every inhabitant does his thing rapidly. His edition is quick and easy; it leaves a lot to desire.", "Bootzin's screenplay, which he wrote alongside a female colleague, is flexible as life itself. It allows us to watch his characters sitting down in the porch with a cup of hot coffee at 10 a.m. in the morning. It allows us to see how culture and education influence a relationship; because Lori went to the army and Alex paints, and Lori doesn't know how Jackson Pollack was. In fact, as Ray correctly observes: \"Nobody knows who Jackson Pollack was\".", "This artistic side of the main character played by Ruffalo, which seems to be the core of the character piece, is not extensively developed. His painting is, as many say, \"soulless\"; or at least at the beginning, because then Alex finds the artistry inside his feelings.", "Even when in the end every character has a big smile in their face, the music inspires happiness and the whole ride has been pleasant, there's a feeling of disappointment. A feeling related to things that could have been present but weren't; to a depth that was intended but didn't appeared."]},

A Scientist professor is trying to create a remedy in his laboratory for the treatment of Cancer. He experiments all such medicines on his pet cat (Who perhaps is suffering from Cancer). When the professor makes the cat to drink the newly prepared medicine, the cat becomes invisible. Then he realizes to his surprise that by mistake he had created a medicine which when taken makes a person invisible. The Hero (Ashok Kumar) is in love with the daughter of Professor (Nalini Jaywant). By mistake Ashok Kumar also drinks the medicine and he also becomes invisible. As the professor had not invented the antidote for his newly prepared medicine, the hero can not come to its live form, and others cannot see him (Hence Mr X). With a view to make others feel his presence he wraps a black bandage tape around his body, which others can see. There is a criminal minded villain (Pran), who is trying to marry Nalilni Jaywant. He commits a lot many crimes, which are all attributed to Ashok Kumar, as he (Ashok Kumar) is termed as an absconder after such crimes. All strange incidents like a car running without a driver, or a girl flying in air etc. are due to invisibility of Ashok Kumar. With lots of misunderstanding & confusion, Ashok Kumar is finally able to prove his innocence when the Professor is able to invent an antidote for his earlier medicine, that can make the invisible person as visible. Hero takes revenge with Pran, who is punished. Ashok Kumar's friend Johny Walker acts as a comedian, who runs a laundry. The famous song \"Lal Lal gal\" is picturised on Johny Walker, when he is ironing the clothes. While doing so, he starts dozing off and then he imagines that he was in a Paris Night Club and singing the above song there. He wake s up when the ironed cloth starts burning. With beautiful music, and very interesting story line, the film was a great hit. This was the first Hindi Movie on the theme of invisibility, which gave follow up themes for other such movies like \"Mr 'X' in Bombay\", Mr India.", "Author: Bimal K Srivastava (bksrivastava2000@gmail.com),\""]},

However, given that the choice between watching films like this and the likes of the 'The Phantom Menace' would have yielded the same conclusion whatever language it was to be viewed in, I am pleased to say that my embryonic graspings of the Dutch language were sufficient to cope in this particular case. Whether this can be put down to simplistic subtitling, the succinct approach to dialogue of Russian films, or director Alexei Balabanov's grasp of the fact that in the hypothetically visual culture of cinema, actions speak louder than words, is debatable. Whatever; I came, I saw, and I enjoyed.", "Director Alexei Balabanov, whose 1997 debut was 'Brother' ('Brat'), has here created a fascinating tale around the subject of pornography in turn of the century St Petersberg. Johann (Sergei Makovetsky), a purveyor of salacious erotic autochromes of staged flagellation scenes, along with assistant Victor, worms his way into the lives of two noble families, drawing adopted Mongolian conjoined twins Kolja and Tolja and the delicately beautiful Lisa (Dinara Drukarova) into his enterprise as subjects for his short erotic films.", "From the early blue-tinted scenes detailing the birth and background of the twins, set to a soundtrack all but silent save for the presence of hisses and scratches, to the vivid invocation of a feverish preoccupation with all things sexual welling beneath the austere trappings of the Russian bourgeoisie, Balabanov lyrically invokes the spirit of the times. 'Of Freaks and Men' is nothing if it is not beautiful and evocative, crisply photographed in monochrome by cinematographer Sergei Astakhov. There is dark quirky humour here, and a host of eccentric periphery characters, from the lustily compliant serving maid, to a blind wife, and Johann's snaggle-toothed henchman. Visually the film is consistently rich and fascinating.", "The premise, of course, is guaranteed to offend the more conservative of viewers. The numerous whipping scenes as well as the portrayal of Johann's treatment of the twins are sure to prove distasteful to those approaching with a more polically correct viewpoint, though the studied art direction and period stylistic veneer distances the viewer to some extent. This, after all is a film about the origins of pornography, and it is not really pornographic in itself. It also touches on a fear of technology (in this case, the emerging medium of cinema), and how that new technology can either empower or enslave. Despite the rather flaccid denouement, and at times seeming slightly overblown in its characterisation of Johann (whose dominance is more usually manifested by means of a handgun rather than a camera), the intriguingly original premise and stunning sepia-toned cinematography should prove ample reward for the curious viewer. After all, there are not a lot of Russian films getting shown over here at the moment."]},

But you'd think there would've been some attempt to at least make this movie funny, it being a comedy and all. You would also think there would be some attempt to make this movie coherent, and the filmmakers don't bother with that, either. Instead, this gay biker movie — the concept is meant to be a punchline in and of itself — is like a bunch of random scenes haphazardly edited into a vague narrative about our heroes riding their ugly purple-gray bikes, complete with sidecars, to L.A. for a drag ball, because, as everyone knows, all gay men live to wear women's clothing. While our bikers are picking up clueless hitchhikers (\"You're all a bunch of f-gs!\"), having condiment fights (\"Look! I'm a hot dog!\"), buying soup (?), recoiling from a group of cackling hookers, tangling with a group of straight bikers, and dress shopping, there are scenes of a bumbling General (George T. Marshall) who spends most of his time barking at his big-haired secretary and pointing to a map. The two independent \"storylines\" (for lack of a better term) come together in the movie's climactic moments when our gay bikers, now in drag, are picked up by the \"straight\"—and evidently blind—bikers and taken to the General's mansion/headquarters for a shocking finale that would've offended me if I weren't so busy pondering questions like: Are we to assume the straight bikers were working for the General? Was the General hosting the drag ball? This ties in with the prologue how, exactly? ", "So, yeah, \"Pink Angels\" is a big, swishy mess, and I suspect director Larry G. Brown knew it given that his screen credit is several point sizes smaller than everyone else's. A Margaret McPherson is blamed for the script, though many of the scenes play like they were improvised. Not surprisingly, \"Angels\" marked the end of Brown's and McPherson's respective movie careers, at least according to their IMDb credits. Exploitation movie veteran John Alderman, as the leader of the gay bikers, manages to maintain his dignity for most of the movie (that is, until he dresses in drag), and Tom Basham, as the clumsiest of the gay bikers, has a few genuinely amusing moments in spite of the material. But ultimately this movie's only redeeming quality is a pre-\"Grizzly Adams\" Dan Haggerty as one of the straight bikers, looking his most f---able. He doesn't do much beyond ride a chopper and wrestle around with one of those hookers, but he makes a favorable impression all the same, especially if you're into muscle bears."]},

The mantle of the Phantom was passed down from father to son through four hundred years, leading people to believe in a single, immortal figure.", "In 1938, Kit Walker (Billy Zane), the Phantom's descendant, finds a man named Quill (James Remar) leading a mercenary group in the jungle. The group is searching for one of the Skulls of Touganda, which grants its owner a tremendously destructive power. The Phantom saves the native boy they have kidnapped to be their guide and captures Quill's men, leading them to be picked by the Jungle Patrol. Revealed as a member of the Sengh Brotherhood and the man who killed Kit's father (Patrick McGoohan), whose ghost frequently appears to Kit to give him advice, Quill escapes with the Skull and returns to the United States.", "In New York City, Kit's former girlfriend from college, Diana Palmer (Kristy Swanson), is a frequent traveler whose uncle, Dave Palmer (Bill Smitrovich), is the famous owner of the World Tribune newspaper. The newspaper has been investigating power-hungry business magnate Xander Drax (Treat Williams), a shady character with a reputation for dealings with criminals. Palmer has managed to uncover that Drax is connected to a mysterious spider web symbol, which he traces back to the Bengalla Jungle. He sends Diana to investigate, but makes the mistake of informing New York's corrupt police commissioner, who is allied with Drax, of Diana's trip. The airplane is hijacked by Drax's female air pirates led by Sala (Catherine Zeta-Jones); Diana is abducted and taken to their base on the waterfront in Bengalla. Having been informed of Diana's abduction by the Jungle Patrol's captain Phillip Horton (Robert Coleby), the Phantom rescues Diana and escapes from Quill and his men to his secret base, the Skull Cave.", "Back in New York, now dressed as his civilian self, Kit meets with Dave Palmer at the World Tribune and once again meets with Diana, who has mixed feelings about him since his sudden disappearance several years before. Diana's would-be suitor Jimmy Wells (Jon Tenney) mentions he has seen one of the skulls in the Museum of World History. Kit and Diana hurry there and are captured by Drax and his men, who steal the second Skull and unite it with the first, revealing the location of the third Skull on an uncharted island in the Andaman Sea known as the Devil's Vortex. Kit manages to escape from Drax and his henchmen and, as the Phantom, evades the police outside the museum. Meanwhile, after Sala reveals that Diana is his girlfriend, she flies Drax, Quill and Diana to the Devil's Vortex, unaware that the Phantom has managed to hitch a ride on one of the plane's landing pontoons.", "On the island, Drax meets with the pirate Kabai Sengh (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa), direct descendant of the Sengh Brotherhood's original leader, who possesses the third Skull. Sengh warns Drax of the existence of the Fourth Skull, which controls the power of the three. The Phantom appears and battles both men, with Kabai Sengh killed by his own pool of sharks, and Diana and Sala cooperate to defeat the other villains. Drax unites the three Skulls and turns their power against the Phantom; in the process, Quill is accidentally disintegrated after the Phantom recovers his father's gunbelt. The Phantom uses the Fourth Skull - his own ring - to turn the Skulls' power back against them, destroying them and Drax in a powerful explosion. As the island is destroyed, the Phantom narrowly escapes with Diana and Sala.", "In Bengala once again, Diana reveals to the Phantom she has figured out his secret and his double identity. Kit removes his mask, informing her that he is allowed all of his secrets to only one person, the woman he intends to marry, but she leaves again for New York. Kit's father laments his son's failure to pursue Diana, but states that she will return to the Phantom's jungle, and to Kit, one day."]},

The actress ", " played the same role in the Telugu film ", ". Both films are remakes of the Hindi film ", ". Laxmi and Sridevi played sisters in 1975in the Hindi hit film ", ".", "Remake of ", " (1972)", "The bitter experiences of my life have shaken my faith in ethics, goodness and the sublime values of life. However the movies like Raagam (1975) is one such phenomena which reassures me that these noble things have not vanished altogether and one should not allow his faith in them to be evaporated.", "The decade of seventies when medicine had not made much progress in our country and the persons who happened to have caught some lethal decease, were seldom able to survive; Mollywood presented many movies whose protagonist was a Jeevikkunna hridhayamulla person with an ever-present smile on lips and possessing a jolly nature with a never-say-die spirit but suffering from a lethal decease. Such protagonist, but natural, died in the end, leaving all his loving ones as grief-stricken behind him. Chithrashalabham (1998), Ithu Nhanghalude Katha (1982) and Daisy (1988) were certain movies in this genre. Raagam also falls into that category only. The difference is that this movie presents a child suffering from cancer who donates his eyes to a blind girl so that she could see the world through his eyes after his demise.", "This kind-hearted and nice child of Raagam (Melody) is Babu (Nataraj) who is the grandson of Vishwanatha Menon (Adoor Bhasi) who has already lost his son and now invested all his love in his little grandson Babu. He lives with his widow daughter-in-law (Sharadha) and sees the shadow of his lost son in Babu only, teaching him all the virtues and noble values of life. Babu happens to come across a blind girl Shreedhevi (Luxme) who lives in a charitable home meant for girls like her only. She is a good sculptor and through Babu, she comes into contact with Babu's mother and grandfather on one hand and a nice boy Madhu (Mohan) on the other. Madhu falls in love with her and decides to make her his life partner. However his father Dharmmapaalan (Shankaradi) gets ready for their marriage only when Shreemathi gets her sight back. It is known after her relevant medical examination that it's possible only when some donor gives his / her eyes for transplantation in her body. Suddenly Babu is found to be suffering from cancer which has gone beyond the stage of treatment. Coming to know this truth, Babu decides to donate his eyes to his loving Chechi, i.e., Shreemathi and finally Shreemathi is able to see this world through Babu's eyes. The movie gets emotional and turns into a tear-jerker in its final half an hour only. Prior to that, it's mainly a feelgood movie which producer-director A.Bheemsingh has made in the style of the prestigious Jammu Films of Mollywood. Certain(both tragic and comic) sequences of this movie remind us Shafi's blockbuster movie – Kalyaanaraaman(2002). The story is flat and told as such only. We see good people with their good thoughts and gestures only. Except for the caricaturesque character of Madhu's father who is a miser but ready to spend money for the sake of fame and honour, all the characters shown are completely positive and virtuous. Prior to the tragic twist in the story, the narrative consists of comic situations and dialogs which may not be able to provoke laughter in the viewer but certainly brings a smile to his / her lips.", "The incident of Babu's trying to understand how it feels to be blind reminds me of a story 'The School for Sympathy' read by me in my English textbook when I was in my secondaries. His deliberately not solving all the questions in the examination so that another boy who is needy of scholarship, is able to get the first rank, also reminds me of a similar story read by me in my Hindi textbook during my primaries. Through these episodes, the filmmaker has highlighted the virtues embedded in the character of this child which touches as well as inspires the audience.", "Raagam is a simple movie, not lavish. It is technically good all the same and every frame of it is beautiful. It is a compact movie which only was the right thing to do for the filmmaker considering its wafer-thin storyline.", "Salil Choudhari has composed good music for the movie with the help of the beautiful lyrics of Vayalar Ramavarmma. Devoid of any chartbusters, this album contains ear-soothing and soul-soothing songs like Aa Kayyilo, Ambaadi Poonkuyile, Guruvaayoorappan, Ivide Kaattinu Sugandham and a very good lullaby - Naadan Paattile Maina.", "Child artist Nataraj has performed very well in the pivotal role whereas Tamil actress Lakshmi has also done satisfactorily in this debut Malayalam movie of herself. Seasoned actors Adoor Bhasi, Sharadha, Shankaradi, Mallika Sukumaran, Bahadoor, Jose Prakash etc. all have done their parts satisfactorily alongwith the romantic hero Mohan. A.Bhimsingh's favourite actor T.P Madhavan has delivered a touching performance in his special appearance in the role of flower-seller Gangaraam. Raagam won the State Award for the best movie which is surprising as this movie is a very simple movie and was not a blockbuster as well. All the same, it's to be admitted that such movies emphatically underscore that goodness does exist even today which is to be preserved and nurtured. The good and virtuous people as shown in the movie may be difficult to find in today's selfish times but their race has not gone extinct. The dumbfound(with grief) character of Adoor Bhasi rightly asserts that God forces the strictest of tests of life on such people only. And it's their greatness that even then they do not give up their goodness and noble values of life adopted by them.", "I recommend this lovely and inspiring movie to one and all.h"]},

He believes he is living a wonderful life, but the audience can see exactly what is happening. There is only a person who lives in the kingdom of Victor and the rest of humanity is out of it. Bajo Ulloa was able to show us the feelings of this young man and how they interfere with normal life. It's something similar to what he did in his two first long films, Alas de Mariposa and La madre muerta. All of them were dramas, incredible ones to be sincere. But suddenly, some chip in his head exploted and he changed to slapstick Spanish comedy, something unusual and much boring. Maybe some day Bajo Ulloa is to see again his first movie and is going to rediscover himself, and everyone is to have back one of the most promising young directors of Spain."]},

And Bhatt later refused to direct 'Khilona (1996)' for this reason.", "Last week, I just happen to rediscover this film directed by Mahesh Bhatt and I must confess that I still can't get the film out of my mind. To me, it's a solid piece of 90's film-making in India. The film is loosely based on the film Scarface (1983) which was directed by Brian De Palma and was written by Oliver Stone. Though, the similarity between the two films is just restricted to the 'rise of a gangster' part. Saathi, essentially is the story of Suraj (Aditya Pancholi) and Amar (Mohsin Khan) and their friendship which also reminds me of Sholay's Jai and Veeru in a vague manner, especially the earlier part.", "The film chronicles the journey of both the friends together from street urchins to petty thieves to life of some serious crime. At a certain point Amar refuses to tread this path of crime and Suraj is hell bent on going on and on. The characterizations of Amar and Suraj also share similarities with Ravi and Vicky respectively from Bhatt's previous film Naam (1986), incidentally written by Salim Khan.", "The strength of the film lies in its brisk and relentless narrative, good performances and good music. The way Bhatt has used the songs to take the narrative further is also commendable. Every song adds up to the narrative in its own way despite of there being six songs in the film. 'Yaarana Yaar Ka', 'Aisa Bhi Dekho Waqt Jeeven Mein Aata Hai' and 'Zindagi Ki Talash Mein' are among the best of the songs in the film. ", "Aditya Pancholi's Suraj and Mohsin Khan's Amar balance each other quite well. Aditya's reckless, impulsive and nervous portrayal of Suraj is one of the actor's best till date. Mohsin's mature, restrained and underplayed interpretation of Amar compliments Suraj quite well. The highlight of the film is the scene where Suraj goes way out of control and shoots the policeman who was responsible for his father's death. ", "The explicitness of violence and drugs portrayed in the film is typically 80's-early 90's which was very much required by the film to make its point regarding connections between poverty, crime and class conflict."]},

In the city of São Paulo she finds the perfect location to film but then everything starts to go wrong: she gets trapped in a elevator with a dead man's corpse and the three guys who want to take him to the coroner; Magda's friend tries to help her and calls 'The Birdman of Alcatraz' (reference from Burt Lancaster's film), the guy who takes care of countless birds and the only one who can repair the elevator; the commercial's director tries to shoot it but the people around him (his crew, the angry building residents, a lady with a dog who thinks her animal will appear in the advertising and many others) will give him some trouble. And the drunk caretaker (Vandi) who does nothing but get more and more drunk avoiding work, not knowing what's happening downstairs.", "The film directed by Ugo Giorgetti is simple, funny, entertaining, it only gets critical on the view that he presents us of São Paulo as a confused city filled with thieves (Magda's friend is robbed on the building several times), hungry and disrespectful people (some of the curious who are watching the commercial being filmed are hungry homeless people who simply entered the building), Fellinian's characters and troubles which are quite comical when they're not overreacting or downplayed. As a São Paulo resident I must say that the movie is totally accurate about the city's downtown decadence where many of the ancient and majestous constructions of the 20th Century ended ruined, old, without care, a real shame. That was true back in 1995 and it still true even now on the 21st Century although now this trend seems to be disappearing a little, downtown is more revitalized, there's some good real infrastructure to welcome visitors in cultural events but there's some abandoned buildings and abandoned spaces too.", "My disappointment with \"Sábado\" is that the film doesn't features many exterior images of the city even though the city is referred a lot, that might bother the viewer who wants to know the things about the city, see it how it was in the 1990's. These exterior scenes doesn't appear much because this movie is like a play, with one scenery and we must live in this place, feel suffocated with it just like the characters in the elevator, trying to get out, to breathe.", "The movie deals with the absurd and the troubles that many people might have witnessed and that's why the comedy is appealing, charming, very odd. The main characters are well performed by a talented group of actors that includes singer Tom Zé, Otávio Augusto, Décio Pignatari (who is the best on scene playing the Birdman of Alcatraz), Giulia Gam, André Abujamra and Jô Soares in a funny brief appearance as a man who lives in the house of machines of the elevator.", "Here's a funny urban chronicle about the problems of a busy world and just when people have a good day to take a rest they need to get up and work for things to get right. And who wants to work on a Saturday afternoon? 10/10."]},

Balu then tells him the truth about Indra, her blindness and Velu's son and cautions him not to talk with her as it might cause both Janaki and Indra to die. Janaki comes to know that Balu has a son and Saro loves Balu. She thinks that Balu is a married person ashamed of his blind wife and hence trying to cheat her sister. She hates him and cautions Saro against him. Saro comes to Balu's house, sees Indra's son Babu, calling Balu as his father and thinks that Balu has cheated her. Indra, on hearing this comes to Velu's house to meet Saro and clear the confusion. Velu, however, on seeing his blind wife pleading for Balu's innocence cannot contain himself and tells the truth to everyone. Janaki on hearing that Indra is her husband's first wife, cannot take the shock and dies. She unites Balu and Saro before dying and apologizes to Balu for having suspected him and thanks him for all the sacrifices he has made for her husband and family."]},

Shannon Tweed is looking a bit ragged at this point and doesn't seem to put in as much effort here. Advice: shut the movie off after Shannon and Rena drive off in the car.

In that statement it almost didn't matter whether the connection to her primary thesis--that advertising is the nemesis of this richness--was made; it was still good to be reminded.", "Been meaning to learn a little more about advertising and the media?

SUN (1956), THE STRANGE CASE OF THE COSMIC RAYS (1957), HEMO THE MAGNIFICENT (1957), THE UNCHAINED GODDESS (1958) - quickly became schoolhouse favorites, where they were endlessly shown in 16mm format.", "The star of the series was Dr. Frank C. Baxter (1896-1982), an affable English professor at the University of Southern California. This avuncular pedagogue proved to be the perfect film instructor, genially imparting to his audience the sometimes complex facts in a manner which never made them seem dull or boring. Dr. Baxter, who won a Peabody Award for his achievements, continued making high quality instructional films after the Capra quartet were concluded.", "THE STRANGE CASE OF THE COSMIC RAYS, which was produced, written & directed by Capra, tells of the search to understand the makeup of the Universe by revealing its most basic components: electrons, neutrons, protons, etc., using experiments, animation and gentle humor. Film star Richard Carlson appears as the Fiction Writer, who presents the story as a scientific mystery to Bil and Cora Baird's marionette figures of Charles Dickens, Edgar Allan Poe & Fydor Dostoevski.", "The devotional sentiments voiced by Dr. Baxter at the end of the film are completely in tune with the tenor & tone of the production."]},

Then I did not even suspect about the film adaptation, as well as the fact that the film would subsequently amaze the imagination and be remembered so much.", "I must say that screenwriter Albina Shulgina created a real miracle from Astafyev's text, worthy of the greatest award. By the way, the book of V. P. Astafiev in 1978 was awarded the highest award of the USSR - the State Prize, albeit with significant censorship exemptions, which subsequently greatly affected the health of Viktor Petrovich, already undermined by the war. And a year later, the same adaptation of Vl. Fetina (real fam. Fetingof) is the director's penultimate film, only this can explain its great quality. Filming a movie in an acute shortage of funds and time pressure. Apparently, for this reason, the so-called. \"Moscow scenes\", for which Tatyana Piletskaya was invited to the role of the mother of the main character. Contrary to popular misconception on the Web, the film is not based solely on the events of the chapter \"Dream of the White Mountains.\" It would be more correct to say that it was filmed based on the entire story of \"Tsar Fish\", which is clearly stated in the opening credits. For example, Akim's famous monologue \"Why did my mother give birth to me? ..\" is borrowed from the chapter \"Wake\". As it happened with the literary source, the film was pretty battered by the Soviet censors (Astafyev even claimed that he was put \"on the shelf\"). At the box office, it was shown with bills, and in the post-Soviet period several minutes of timing \"disappeared\" from it (the scenes are mainly associated with Goga Gertsev). An attentive viewer will surely notice that the key scene with the overturning of the raft into the icy water is missing from the film. Subsequently, the taiga masterpiece was safely forgotten - and only this can explain that it has never been restored or published on DVD.", "The music for the film was written by the legendary Soviet composer Solovyov-Sedoy (the last work for the cinema). This work was carried out during a period of serious illness, and the composer did not live to see the premiere for only a month. By the way, in the scene with the feast in the winter quarters, where Elya turns the radio up louder, a slightly modified melody of \"Moscow Nights\" is heard - one of the most recognizable motifs of the 20th century, which became the call sign of the radio \"Mayak\". This is a rather subtle allusion to the merits, without a doubt, of the great melodist, who has worked very successfully with Vladimir Fetin in recent years.", "The Tale belongs to a number of outstanding adaptations of Russian classical prose. She practically has no equal neither in the genre of an acting duet, nor in the genre of films on the taiga theme. She, one might say, has no analogues in both Soviet and post-Soviet cinema.", "And further. Perhaps the most important thing. This is a very Russian film."]},

And staying true to his promise never to direct another film after Fanny and Alexander, he couldn't have picked a better director for his script than his protege and long-time colleague Liv Ullman. So, what we end up with in Faithless, is a true-to-form Bergmanesque tale that runs a bit too long and has one too many tragedies.", "For the most part, the film is pretty much saved by excellent performances, especially the portrayal of Marianne by Lena Endre. The plot is a tangled web of infidelity and its consequences, punctuated with as much heartbreak, pain and suffering as any Bergman opus, and certainly as much as the average viewer can imagine or tolerate. To be sure, Bergman isn't for everyone. But if you enjoy an occasional catharsis, immobilizing intensity and walking out of the theater thinking your life isn't as bad as you thought it was, this film's for you. For those of you familiar with and amenable to Bergman trademarks, you won't be disappointed. There are plenty of long facial close-ups, monologues, ghosts as figurative demons, and a character that represents Bergman himself. This last feature is one of the machinations I feel we could have done without. It adds a character who is not really part of the plot and does little more than listen. There's also a heaviness to the plot that kind of hits you over the head. Major drama is all right with me, and Bergman is one of the best in that genre, but it was dangerously close to the saturation point of redundance and pretension. Nevertheless, for all you Bergman fans, foreign film lovers and wanna-be celluloid asthetes, you really should add this title to your repetoire. Bergman is truly one of the greatest filmmakers of all time, and considering his very advanced age, this could be his last outing. Then again..."]},

Vendedora focuses on girls equally affected by poverty, ignorance, abuse and neglect. It earns a place next to Mira Nair's Salaam Bombay and Hector Babenco's Pixote, excellent urban youth films in the tradition of Bunuel's Los Olvidados. Vendedora does not shy away from depicting the effects of drugs, violence, and family dysfunction while allowing for  brief moments of tenderness and solidarity, even joy. Gaviria has enlisted street kids in enacting events from their daily lives, during 48 hours preceding Christmas. The film refuses to cheapen their plight with plot contrivances or stylistic flourishes. The spanish spoken is specific to the youth of Medellin, a welcome challenge to most native speakers. The fate of the characters evolves naturally from earlier scenes, without being predictable. I recommend La Vendedora de Rosas to anybody who considers film a window to the world of folks we wouldn't otherwise be able to access and an opportunity to understand it."]},

They have lost touch as they became adults as often happens until one day two of them get news that the third is homeless and living in Coney Island. so the two take off from work \"on a mission from God\" (their code to play hooky from school as kids) to find their friend. So the stage is set for a journey of friendship and discovery as we see how these grown men have faced adulthood and its challenges, or more importantly, run from them. We experience their childhood through a series of flashbacks from which we gleam information that directly impacts the present day narrative such as that their missing friend may not have been heterosexual, though they knew him as a ladies man and how this led to a huge tragedy in his life. This kind of movie is hard to pull off and could easily fall into Hollywood schmaltz with a lot of weeping and teary-eyed falsehoods. But this movie avoids all that and keeps a rather hard edge at all times. Understanding that the subject matter is serious and never makes fun of its characters, or looks down on them to pull at your heart strings. The terrific acting goes a long, long way to make this all work with kudos to Cryer who essays the less flashy role of the nebbish. Newcomer Rick Steer is really good as well as his angry, alcoholic friend who has tried to hang onto their youth for all these years. Rafeal Baez is very good as the lost friend too, in a difficult role, having to play both repression and mental illness without over doing it. he does a fine job. Ione Skye is on board in a supporting role and it is always nice to see her too. Overall this is a little gem of a movie that has for some reason been overlooked for almost ten years now. Time to rectify that situation."]},

I could see why Babsy is so popular because she is so much fun. Sadly, Sid James died in 1976 and he was the king of the Carry On playing the dirty old man most of the time. The lovely Dame of British comedy, Joan Sims, never got to be a dame, a CBE, An OBE, or an MBE during her lifetime but I hope somebody out there would consider an award named after her for women who provide lifetime achievement in comedy. Even though, most of us known Joan from As Time Goes By as Madgie. She was truly a gifted comedic actress worthy of such honors that was never properly bestowed upon her and it is pity. Maybe it's because Carry On stars like Barbara Windsor and Kenneth Connor were finally awarded MBEs but it was something. Maybe the honors committee don't consider the Carry Ons to be anything to be proud so they knight and Dame those Shakespearan actors and actresses instead but I bet that they don't have as much fun as the Carry On Gang does here. Carry On isn't classless but a teaser of a show for everybody involved. They appear to have a lot of fun making it without getting awards. Maybe that's why they don't matter as much."]},

Three characters--Gilly, a photographer, and two of his friends (neither of whom have many distinguishing characteristics, other than looking like the human characters in Scooby-Doo from a distance)--work for a magazine that does exposes into supernatural phenomena. They are assisted by a quirky dog, Goober (voiced by Paul Winchell, as are many of the minor characters on the show also), who becomes invisible when trouble arises. He also makes asides to himself as the action unrolls. In these mysteries, about half the time, they are aided by the four YOUNGER members of the Partridge Family (in other words, NOT Shirley or David). Three of the four of them are not developed in any way or given many lines. The only Partridge heavily involved in the plots and given a lot of lines is Danny Bonaduce, which is good since his sarcastic and witty remarks are like having a member of the Little Rascals along for the ride. The plots are somewhat similar, although they work as mysteries aimed at the seven-year-old intelligence. This series SOUNDS more interesting than it is, when one reads a description of it on a history of animation website. It's not really worth finding a copy unless you are a serious Scooby fan or a student of early 70's Hanna-Barbera animation. I showed an episode or two of this to my teen-aged children, both big fans of the original Scooby-Doo, and they thought even less of it than I did. The usual professional H-B product, but just uninspired."]},

Some veterans claim that the pilots of the RAF never behaved in such a loutish manner, while others say that \"Piece of Cake\" is closer to the truth than most people would like to admit. Robinson researches all his books, and states that everything in them actually did happen at some point, and that he only dramatized reality by putting all the characters and events into one story. Characters like the cad Moggy Cattermole, the unbalanced Flash Gordon, or the abjectly terrified Pip Patterson are the same kind of people you'd find in an English public school -- just like the real pilots of the Royal Air Force.

The flawed humanity of its characters makes the sacrifice of the real pilots much easier to understand than if they were portrayed simply as selfless heroes, even if we would be more comfortable remembering them that way.", "The flying scenes in this series are definitely above average and should be enough to recommend it to aviation enthusiasts. A few clips here and there come from 1969's \"Battle of Britain\", but for the most part the scenes of Spitfires taking off and landing or flying in formation are all brand-new, including some low-level stunts involving bridges. These were real stunts performed by a real pilot -- they found the longest single-span stone bridge in the country, and flew a real Spitfire under it. It's a hell of a scene.", "Apart from all that, the series is very well done. The acting is great all round, particularly Neil Dudgeon as Cattermole and Richard Hope as Skelton. The script is funny and extremely quotable.

Ms. Bockrath is one of the loveliest blondes to ever grace the pages of Playboy. Here she is at her most beautiful, prancing around a house, and sponging her body in a tub. The other Texan, Karen Foster, would later be featured in her own Video release, with Deborah Driggs. Suffice it to say, you have never met a blonde baton twirler with the physical assets of Karen. In between is Canadian superwoman Peggy McIntaggart. She looks like a Greek goddess, really. The blue-lit sequence with her in bed is more erotic than anything you will see out of Hollywood. The remaining playmates are all wonderful, too. Lisa Matthews would go on to become playmate of the year. Renee Tennison was the reigning pmoy. The video closes with a delightful sequence involving Jacqueline Sheen. Wearing a derby and a black vest, she is disrobed by men(?) wearing white gloves, each attempting to touch her supple, warm body. You have never seen a cabaret number like this, and you probably never will in a film. But Playboy videos are another matter. The best are in a class by themselves. You don't need to watch them because of their power to arouse; you watch them to appreciate female beauty in visually stunning, mood-inspiring settings. L'art de la femme, 10+++."]},

There's no dialogue, so there's no language barrier. Unfortunately, the lack of dialogue calls attention to the fact that this is basically a home movie, not a documentary. Kren shows no interest in (or no ability for) shaping his footage to make a point or convey information: he's basically just showing us some of the things that his troupe experienced.", "Much of this movie seems to have been filmed with the camera at crotch level, which I don't think is meant as a sexual comment.

There's a reason for conventional film-making techniques: most of the time, the tried and true methods of telling a story on film really *are* the best methods. Kren seems to want to tell stories in an unusual way, but hasn't bothered to come up with stories that demand unusual narrative techniques.", "I'll rate '23/69: Underground Explosion' 5 out of 10, because it's interesting to look at for the few minutes of its running time.

What we are reviewing here is the tv version which is less successful. Some shows don't translate well to television. Applause is one of them. To have seen it in person & felt the joy of a live performance & then have to compare it to this version is slightly sad. It's still a tight show & Bacall is magnificent. (in spite of the nasty queen's insulting review here. He apparently has no taste. Just a viscous tongue & poor eyesight) But it's all we have & if we can stretch our imagination, we can still see how thrilling it must have been on Broadway. It won several Tony awards including Best Musical & Best actress for Bacall which it deserved. We have no other version left for us other than a cast album and so I am grateful for this flawed time capsule video version. Flawed? Yes but still, I love it."]},

All age groups will love it and you'd want to watch it over and over. Dharmendra and Hema do an excellant performance (whilst maintaining their passion) and a little appearance from Shammi Kapoor livins up the film abit. The film starts off with a little 'Mask Of Zorro' style genre, Dharmendra is dressed in a cape and sets off to save a young girl. Dharmendra is a mischevious lad in this film who is living with his bhabee. His name is Ashok (Azaad) and goes around villages helping others and giving little 'freddom speeches' while creating havok. He then comes across a princess (Hema Malini) who has set a farm on fire, Dharmendra beats up the princesses guards which leads to his bhabee leaving. Instead Dharmendra leaves and reaches his bhabee's brother's house where he lives with his sister. He soon realises he's in the region of the princess (Hema) and a little hilarious intro starts his stay off. He finds a job at a beer factory which is owned by Hema, but this is just a plan for her to get her own back, and so she does by making Dharmendra ride a drunken horse (without him knowing), but Dharmendra returns and captures the princess and makes her live like a tramp but being clever Hema chucks him into a well. To get a taste of her own medicine she is pounced upon by a tiger but Dharmendra saves her, they fall in love. The film goes on to show other plots but that would be destroying the fun for you, you have to see it to have loads of laughs! My fav parts are the beginning (Dharmendra dressed like Zorro), Dharmendra swinging through the tress while singing to 'Mein Azaad' and Dharmendra rading the princesses camp before kidnapping her (alot of laughs in this part). Trust me you'll enjoy this one, excellent and enjoyable for all the family!"]},

Thanks to Severin Films & Ryko Distribution, fans of schlock Italian B grade genre cinema can finally get to revel in the supreme awfulness that is Alfonso Brescia's BEAST IN SPACE, the \"adults only\" capstone on his Italian STAR WARS ripoff epics: BATTLE OF THE STARS, COSMOS - BATTLE OF THE PLANETS, WAR OF THE ROBOTS and last but not least STAR ODYSSEY. And while they aren't particularly \"good\" movies they have a certain special something about them that fans of this kind of junk will feed on like a fat guy at Wendy's.", "The premise behind the quintuplet of films is simple: Take the look of STAR WARS, cheapen it down to the production design standards of community theater, come up with four or five scripts that make provisions for recycling the same sets, costumes, props, actors, and special effects sequences (usually consisting of poorly made models being swung across a star field with odd sound effects), get Marcello Giombini to compose a couple hours of seemingly random yet listenable synthesizer music and audio washes, then edit the results together into segments of about 90 minutes, each with it's own title so that audiences know which installment they are watching. Presto.", "BEAST IN SPACE can be properly referred to as the porno one, and does indeed exist in both standard and full-blown XXX versions that literally does go where no man has gone before. Even FLESH GORDON looks sophisticated compared to this lovable mess which exists not so much to be \"enjoyed\" as to be marveled at. You sort of wonder what the heck they were thinking, as the film apparently has no specific intended audience: Since the emphasis often revolves around space couples having space sex in their space beds the film is removed from the kind of juvenile dreck that excused the other four films from the \"series\". You can't just plop the kids down in front of this and let the laser beams and disco space costumes wile away a rainy afternoon. But since the production design is so schlocky and minimalist, grown-ups used to a higher layer of gloss on their disco era science fiction craptaculars will find the results laughable at best.", "So that leaves us with the porn, which manages to be even less erotic than such contemporaneous Italian excesses as \"Emanuelle in America\" or everybody's favorite, PORNO HOLOCAUST, which were at least sick enough to engender a bad laugh every once in a while, and which are about the only things that BEAST IN SPACE can be accurately compared to. Other than it's namesake of course, Walerian Borowczyk's THE BEAST, which apparently was part of the inspiration for the film since we are likewise treated to extended sequences that feature horses copulating. Gee.", "Just how such a spectacle is worked into an ultra low budget Italian STAR WARS ripoff is just something you'll have to figure out for yourself -- I am more interested in the \"Buck Rogers in the 25th Century\" era disco space fashions, the clunky production design, the absolutely meaningless plotting and over-use of blended color schemes. These films exist as sort of visceral experiences to be witnessed rather than discreet stories to be digested, and if anything can be said about the new DVD versions is that they look spectacular. ALL of the Alfonso Brescia STAR WARS ripoffs deserve this kind of treatment, and it is perhaps a sad testament to the state of today's DVD industry that the only one some reputable company thought worthy of restoring to it's anamorphic glory is the one with the tits.", "If anything here is yet another culmination of the Italian B grade genre cinema years when they pulled out all the stops of pretending to be anything but sex films and went straight for the gutter. The results will be amusingly refreshing to any fan of European cult cinema, though the non initiated might want to think about trying these out as a rental first. Bring your own towel.", "4/10"]},

The rest of the cast is equally well chosen: Maurizio Arena (a chubby song-and-dance man in a run-down variety act), Ettore Manni (a henpecked and alcoholic restaurant owner), Marisa Merlini (Arena's possessive mother), Susan Scott (as a prostitute and Chiari's old flame), Vittorio Caprioli (an irritable wealthy industrialist whose son is the kidnap victim), Franca Valeri (his wife, who strikes a deal with Chiari's gang for half the ransom price!), Venantino Venantini (as the French gangster behind the kidnapping and who has a penchant for S&M games  the most memorable involving his private parts and a suitcase!  which Scott is all-too-happy to oblige).", "Chiari devises an elaborate scheme to double-cross the kidnappers by following their every move via a number of vehicles (car hidden in moving van, motorcycle stashed in car boot, etc.); the film's comedy quotient (both verbal and visual) is consistent and generally inspired  with perhaps the most hilarious running-gag being the car about to pursue the kidnappers tumbling sideways out of the van onto the pavement. Though suffering from the occasional longueur due to excessive length, the film is buoyed by a most pleasant score from Gianni Ferrio; ultimately, THE RIP-OFF emerged as a more satisfying effort than the gialli for which director Ercoli (whose last film this proved to be) is best known!"]},

The first, a young, Downs Syndrome child who had been brutally raped and murdered and a grown man found in a river. I felt his frustration as he tried to work through this resistance of the people to solve the murders and his friendship with a little boy that everyone picked on.  It was a dark movie about how violence can lead to violence and how a group of people can band together to convict a person before a trial and take it out on his family.  In the end, the towns people were right, but their vigilantism was wrong and led to the death of one more young person.

The majority of the film was intense verbal fighting between Ramm and the towns people as he met with their resistence. Though there is one scene that I would seriously caution the viewer on. Ramm finds a video cassette with the rape and murder of the child on it and watches it.  Sorenson brought Ramm to tears as he watched it.  It brought me to tears as well."]},

With too much unnecessary glamour, body expose, theatrical performances and average musical score, MPKDH did not have anything worthwhile to offer to the audience who approached the theatres with high expectations and quite naturally, it bombed on the box office. However anybody who has been following the movies of Sooraj's banner (actually his grandfather's banner) - Rajshri Productions, could easily see that MPKDH was actually an urbanized remake of an old classic of this banner which kept the flag of simplicity, high values of life and Indianness high in Hindi cinema for around two and a half decades. The original classic movie in this context is Chitchor (1976).", "Chitchor (heart-stealer) is a lovely movie which got turned into an unforgettable one by the brilliant performances and the excellent music. The pivotal character of the story is Geeta (Zarina Wahaab) who lives with her parents in a small town. Her father, Pitambar Chaudhary (A.K. Hungal) is a schoolmaster who alongwith her mother (Deena Paathak) is concerned about her marriage (like any traditional Indian parents). Her married elder sister, Meera (Ritu Kamal) informs them from Mumbai (then Bombay) a suitable boy who is an engineer, is coming to their place for work and he should be welcomed and treated properly by them to woo him for consenting to marry Geeta. The parents do the same. The arriving person is Vinod (Amol Palekar) who does not know the background behind his welcome and hospitality but through his nature and behaviour he is able to win the hearts of all including that of Geeta. But the twist in the tale comes when the case turns out to be that of mistaken identity. Actually, the person who was suggested by Meera as the prospective groom for Geeta is Sunil (Vijayendra Ghaatage) and not Vinod who is not engineer but his subordinate overseer. Sunil also arrives at the place and now Geeta's parents are in a fix as to how to deal with Vinod whom they had been treating as their prospective son-in-law because quite naturally, the (more) suitable boy is the engineer and not the overseer, forg tting the fact that the heart of a girl once gone for a boy, it's gone. She cannot change her feelings according to the post and the status of the boys. After an emotional drama, the movie reaches its happy ending when Geeta asserts herself and disallows others to decide her destiny.", "This simple yet highly touching love story has been penned by Subodh Ghosh which ace director, Basu Chatterjee has adapted for the screen with finesse by writing the screenplay and the dialogs himself. It's the simplicity of the story, the characters and the complete milieu which makes this movie a winner all the way. The characters are innocent ones with hearts of gold and they effortlessly take the viewer away with their talks, gesture and activities towards the desired culmination of the story. The spectator becomes a part of their psyche, desiring the same which is bound to happen ultimately.", "This was the first movie of Vijayendra Ghatage whereas Amol Palekar and Zarina Wahaab too were in the initial phase of their respective careers only. And all three have delivered outstanding performances with ample support from seasoned character artists like A.K. Hungal and Deena Paathak and also from the number one child artist of his time, Master Raju. ", "This movie despite Rajshri's penchant for the traditional social values prevailing in India (which expect the daughter of the house to bow before the decision of her parents regarding her marriage), surprisingly makes the audience hear the footsteps of the woman-lib movement in which the girl wants to decide her groom herself. Zarina Wahaab with her girl next door looks, has delivered a highly confident performance in her role which, in the climax, set the bells of woman-lib ringing for the middle class Indian girls who wanted to be the decider for their fate but could not, being caught in the shackles of social tradition where the parents only could decide what's good for them. This way, it was a path-breaker in the regular Bollywood cinema.", "The movie could not be such a grand success as well as considered a classic if not for the unforgettable music of Ravindra Jain. This blind music maestro not only composed great melodies based on classical Raagas but also wrote heart-soothing lyrics of high literary quality for them. Gori Tera Gaaon Bada Pyaara, Tu Jo Mere Sur Mein Sur Mila Le and Aaj Se Pehle Aaj Se Zyaada Khushi Aaj Tak Nahin Mili. If you ask for my favourite song from this movie, it's Jab Deep Jale Aana, Jab Shaam Dhale Aana which is based on Raag Yaman. Ravindra Jain introduced K.J. Yesudaas and Hemlata as playback singers from this album.", "True to its title, this movie is a CHITCHOR who will steal your heart."]},

The print that was shown on TCM was a little dark but there was still plenty of detail in the colors and what really jumped off the screen were the orange and pink colors that really looked good.

The film's saving grace is some beautiful photography of the villages and coastal areas of southern Italy. There are several visually striking moments that linger in the mind after the film is over. There is also a typically Italian musical score, lush and somewhat overwrought, that nevertheless heightens what drama there is. It is particularly effective at the film's conclusion just before the final credits begin. The opening sequence is also very well done. Seberg and Stafford are off-camera arguing about where they will spend their vacation, while Cestie listens in. As the credits begin there is a cut to a 747 lifting off a runway during the twilight of early evening. When the film's title appears on screen there is then a cut to the sun-drenched seaside cliffs of the Italian coast. The set-up for the entire film is beautifully established in the course of a few minutes.", "The performances are acceptable except for Seberg. It is easy and very sad to see why her acting career ended only a year later. She seems barely able to move or deliver her lines, let alone create a convincing character. It is nearly impossible to believe that this is the same actress who only ten years earlier gave such a powerful performance in the film \"Lilith\". Both Seberg and Stafford died in 1979."]},

The cast list alone was enough to draw my attention to it.  I watched it a week or so ago when it was screened on television and I must admit that I was rather let down by it.  The main failing is in the plot, it is not as interesting as the subject matter suggests it should be. The plot concentrates on the English more than the Hindus and this takes away from the supposed focus.  It really should have done more to show one incident of sacrifice rather than trying to present a fuller picture in a short running time.", "Aside from the specifics I found it annoying that the film simplified the history to make a film that seeks to apologise for the bad treatment that no one questions was dished out - however things did not happen like this. The Hindu soldiers deserve their story to be told, but they deserve a better film than this to do it.  This main weakness makes the rest of the film even more wasteful - for the actual production is very good.", "The cast is pretty good and features an early (and rare straight) role for Sanjeev Bhaskar, who does pretty well.  The rest of the cast has quite a few big names in it (for a short) but they are not very well used.  Branagh and McGann are both good actors but they have little to do.  The production values of the film are also very high with a very realistic sense of time and place.  The fact that this effort was put into a story that doesn't engage, doesn't resemble what really happened and is far too apologetic in nature rather than just letting the facts speak for themselves.", "Overall, I am always willing to give any short film a try - whether it be student animation or an all star production, however this really needed more than a name cast and expensive production to draw me in.  The history behind this story is far too interesting to be delivered in a manner such as this. I rarely say this about a short film, never mind a short film that had so much effort put in, but this film is not worth watching which is a shame because the production is good, the cast impressive and the actual story very worthy."]},

Among the list of demands was $100,000 bail for a Black Panther, and 10,000 free tickets.", "Nonetheless, the fences fell because of the demonstrations, and the venue was overrun with freeloading gate-crashers. As a result, many performers refused to play, even though they were paid half in advance. (One scene has a wimpy exec having the unenviable task of telling the ugly crowds that Sly and the Family Stone wouldn't be showing up.)", "In order to pad out this documentary, some fictional footage was shot years later, featuring DJ Murray the K taking calls from people relating what's going down at Randall's Island. Also, there is an actor who portrays the concert promoter. In one pivotal scene, he meets with the demonstrators. And since he is an African-American who has worked his way out of the ghetto, he asks why he is the one who has to solve their problems (remembering that these groups feature a lot of well-fed white people).", "And truthfully, he has a point. This is a volatile argument in one angry, sarcastic movie. THE DAY THE MUSIC DIED is perhaps the best film I've seen that describes the dichotomy of 60's counterculture.... where hippies who utter peace and love, or people who take the stances of radicals, use these identities as excuses to freeload off of other people's hard work. What is even more incredible is that this documentary makes this point with its ridiculous fictional footage!", "And amidst the documentary footage of people bitching that they paid 21 dollars for this event, and some random clips of the performers who did play, -Mountain (\"Mississippi Queen\"), Van Morrison (\"Come Running\")- we see footage by artists who were never there! The Doors' \"People are Strange\" performance film (later featured in their \"Dance on Fire\" video collection), is prominently featured. While at first this seems like a silly way to give more running time to the movie, it nonetheless makes sense featuring Jim Morrison, the poster boy of chaos and disorder, amidst a backdrop that is out of control. ", "Similarly, we see snippets of Angela Davis, Richard Nixon, Vietnam, The Red Berets and Malcolm X interspersed throughout, and the choice of music becomes more symbolic. When we hear Steppenwolf, the song is \"America\". The movie concludes with Jimi Hendrix's \"Star Spangled Banner\", which although played at Woodstock (3 Days of Peace and Love), is in a perfectly Satanic context here.. summarizing this hour-long treatise of a nation (and a generation) out of control.", "Sometimes the most profound things occur by accident.

Up until this time, sex, drugs, adultery, abortion and so many other taboo topics were anything but taboo. But starting in 1934, filmmakers were in a quandary...how could they appeal to the baser instincts of many folks? The answer were so-called 'educational films'....movies that purported to warn parents against various sins but were mostly just excuses to SHOW all this vice! And, since many theaters refused to show these films, folks often made the films and drove across the country showing them in special engagements in a wide variety of venues. At least 90% of these movies were garbage...with abysmal acting and writing. They also often gave false and confusing messages that either actually ENCOURAGED the sinful behavior or dispensed 'facts' that were completely ridiculous. Some of the worst of them were \"Sex Madness\", \"Reefer Madness\" and \"She Shoulda Said No!\"....but these are just a few of hundreds of terrible exploitation films of the era.", "Is \"Devil's Harvest\" one of the terrible exploitation movies that strange people (like me) enjoy laughing at today because they are so inept and silly? Well, it's not good...nor is as laughably bad as some of the more egregious examples.", "This film is about the evils of marijuana and a gang who have infiltrated a town and are corrupting the youth. At a local 'dance club' young people dance....and succumb to the evils of pot! In one scene, a huge fight breaks out...caused by pot. So the police investigate and send in an undercover agent to flush out the demons responsible for wacky tobacky.", "As you'd expect, the acting looks unprofessional and is highly uneven. A few of the 'actors' aren't bad...but most obviously are NOT professionals and it shows. Additionally, the effects of marijuana are greatly overstated (not surprising) but don't sink to the level of the piano playing guy in \"Reefer Madness\"!

Many others, which he had known as a child, were already gone and vanished for ever: the \"calabaceros\" who passed gourds of water up the hill with their arms, women that collected petals for making flower carpets in Mazo, the water-men who carried ice and water in jars form the tip of the mountains to the valley on mules...", "Siro Manuel's interest for color and light, that made of him a watercolor painter, is also visible in the documentary \"En el corazón de la Atlàntida\". Intens red, black and ochre in volcanic soil, bright blue and green in the Atlantic ocean, light yellow and blue in the deep sky above the mountains, with thousands of colours of flowers, are visible on the screen, like several paintings in a sequence of beauty.", "He was married to Isabel Galés, a Catalan university teacher connected to literature, and he knew well enough the Catalan poem \"l'Atlàntida\", by the poet Jacint Verdagué i Santaló. The title of the documentary is joking with the mystic Canary beauty, the secret strange flora and fauna found deep in the volcanic valley and above the clouds at the highest peaks. At the same time, it tries to promote reflexion and interest for the archaeological features, the unknown origin and culture of the old inhabitants of the island.", "The reference to lost Atlantis is also an allusion to his childhood in the islands, a reference to his nostalgic sense of lost paradise in his native land. His esoterism was connected to his interest in transcendence as an artist, as much as to his sense of theatrical language and cinema production.", "Siro Manuel,dead in January 2003, belonged to the same generation of painters as Raúl Tabares, Manolo Sánchez Mario Baudet, González Bernáldez and others, with whom he was good friends. With many of them he shared affinities for painting, radio, television, cinema and audiovisual sciences. He always regretted that computers and Internet arrived too late for him, although he was still interested in the possibilities of digital image treatment at the end of his life, as much as he was for water color when he started to paint, back in the Spanish postwar era, as a child in La Palma, \"la Isla Bonita\".", "The film \"En el corazón de la Atlàntida\" was evidence of his creative force, an example of his shared dream with some of his journalist friends: to dedicate a TV series to the Canary Islands and its secret beauty. It was never achieved.", "On March 20th, 2005, the Canarian journalist Francisco Padrón Hernández wrote about Siro Manuel Lorenzo: \"We wrote a series for TV together when these events (mysteries) were not as fashionable as they were later. This was also a series exclusively dedicated to explaining strange facts and events that happened in the Canary Islands. A complex challenge. impossible to produce. Complete interference.\" (http://www.atravesdelcristal.com/Noticias.htm) ", "Those of us who met Siro Manuel and shared dreams with him, know that he was in love with the Canary Islands and their colours, with light and beauty, with literature and challenges. This film is a clear example of all this."]},

He wrote the brilliant expressionist play 'Gas', which is now recognised as a crucial influence on Fritz Lang's 'Metropolis', my nomination for the greatest movie ever made. Kaiser also wrote 'The Coral', a somewhat more realistic stage play -- about a disaffected industrialist who swaps lives with his employee, then murders the employee so as to fake his own death -- which I found deeply moving.", "'The Farmer from Texas' involves a life-swap similar to the one in 'The Coral' -- at the beginning of life, rather than at the end of life -- but this movie impressed me far less than 'The Coral' did.", "The Count von Stjernenhoe (Christian Bummerstädt) is a German nobleman who has married Mabel Bratt, the daughter of a wealthy American farmer. She is bringing her father's wealth to the marriage; this being a German film for German audiences, it's strongly implied that the blue-blooded count brings his superior Übermensch genes to the marriage. Indeed, the marriage soon produces a strapping infant boy. However, for deeply contrived reasons, this kid gets switched with the young son of Mrs Appelboom, an impoverished widow. Each son gets raised in the wrong household.", "In young manhood, Erik (Edmund Burns) is the American farmer who's actually heir to a German earldom, whilst the more effete Akke is the false heir who doesn't know he's actually the son of a hick. Naturally, this German movie assumes that nature trumps nurture, and Erik is a true exemplar of the master race despite his upbringing.", "The movie is meant to be a comedy, but I didn't laugh once. I do give the film some credit for attempting to guy both of the cultures depicted here: the Old World as well as the New. I've seen or read several of Georg Kaiser's plays, but I'm not familiar with the one that this movie is allegedly based upon. As such, I felt as if I was watching a rip-off of 'The Prince and the Pauper' or 'Pudd'nhead Wilson', both of which feature a premise similar to the one in this movie.", "This film was directed by Joe May, a Jewish colleague of the half-Jewish Fritz Lang who fled Europe at about the same time as Lang for similar reasons. Both men ended up in Hollywood, but Lang's Stateside film career is far more notable than May's. Shortly before 'The Farmer from Texas' went into production, Joe May's 22-year-old daughter shot herself to death, apparently an intentional suicide. That might explain why this movie (allegedly a comedy) isn't very funny. My rating is just 4 out of 10."]},

One more thing, the whole thing had multi-cuts that kept things moving along. For the most part, I was pretty entertained though part of me wanted to hear some of the songs performed at the Garden. (even Yoko's!) On that note, I highly recommend Happy Birthday to John."]},

As you'd expect from a short narrated by Smith, there's quite a bit of comic tone thrown into this but for the most part you get a pretty good idea of what it takes to get a horse ready for racing. We see how they break the horse to get it prepared for racing and then we get to see what it takes to train him. We also get a slow motion look at the harness itself and how it's constructed to make sure the horse races the right way. I'm going to guess that some animal lovers might not agree with this but there's certainly nothing graphic or harmful here. For the most part I found this to be an entertaining entry in the Sports Parade series, which kept up a good pace for its 10-minutes. The film manages to have a couple good laughs, a great bit of educational purpose and the finale gives us a pretty exciting race."]},

The film does not feautre gunfights, wild car chases, or exotic locales. Instead, it features some hard-working, unglamourous French police officers working on a case step-by-step, slowly, carefully. Each \"shady\" character has an interesting story and each witness has some kind of personal agenda. The police officials are not supermen or Bogart-like; they are office-based men who are professionals. In the US, the film was redubbed, changing character names, although I haven't viewed the French original, so I don't know if plot elements were changed. It was also released as an exploitation film, which is really a stretch. There is a white slavery element to the plot, but it's not sexy at all and there are NO scantilly clad women anywhere to be seen. Anyone taken in by that advertising angle had better like routine police dramas, or he will be let down! Overall, an interesting police detection drama, but no cheesecake and definitely not \"shocking\" or \"daring\" as advertised on the risque poster used to promote the film originally!"]},

The film is semi-comical as the man finds himself frustrated by the lack of co-operation from his idol.  He begins excited by going to her home or even to talk to her on the phone, but leaves jaded - his image of her tainted forever. She died less than a year later.", "The film basically tells us about Gardner as she got older but it also says something about icons generally.  If we find out too much then they lose their mystic and become flawed.  Wouldn't we rather be left with a handful of images and tales of legend rather than the truth which causes them to lose their shine?  This film shows that well in the eyes of the lead actor as he is forced to do a joke of an interview with his icon over the intercom!", "The film is well directed with cool black and white working very well. The use of old dialogue from The Barefoot Countessa is very good and generally it's shot well.  The lead actor does well to transform childish excitement and elation into a dull disappointment that you can feel through the screen.", "Overall this is fascinating because it is a true story of an icon changed by knowledge.  However it is also a very good short that has a good idea as it's backbone and delivers it with style."]},

Also venturing to the island are a slap crew of short-term convicts and their overseers (assigned to grave-digging) and Soto - a missing persons investigator with a slightly mysterious past. Things start to go very very wrong after about half an hour, and people start to die and decay at a supernatural pace. I won't spoil the film by continuing my discussion, but I will say that although there are no zombies in the film, and virtually no special effects and minimal makeup, there are aspects of this film's atmosphere and basic dynamics which are very reminiscent of George A Romero. But this is very much a New York film.", "What got me was not the acting, though there's nothing really wrong with it. Burce Ramsay is very likable and so is Soto. McDowell has a few inspired moments, but this is not one of his best roles. The script didn't quite do it either, since there are at least a couple of spots where the behavior of the characters seems quite ludicrous.", "What got me was the way the film was made - the directing and photography, to be More specific. This is a very visually interesting film, involving simple visual ideas, metaphors and symbols which are eerie, creepy, but not at all heavy-handed. And Some truly wonderful decaying urban landscapes.", "Island of the Dead is absurd, noticeably low budget, and not very original in most ways, but it also reaches beyond its apparent potential and will entertain you if you let it - and if you like this sort of thing."]},

It is a lighthearted story about three guys, one of whom (Dharmendra) is heir to the throne of the murdered King Maharaja. He disappeared in childhood, and the king's extremely loyal assistant (Pran) still looks for him, as much as he does for his own son (Mithun) who disappeared on that same day and who happens to be one of the trio. Well, the film follows the story of the three guys (the third being Danny, by the way), their stories, their struggles and their romances. Amrish Puri plays the typical villain who killed Maharaja and who is also the father of Mithun's love interest Usha. Well it will not look that complicated when you see the film as much as it sounds now. The story is refreshing, well-narrated and interesting. It's essentially an action film but has its substantial share of drama and romance. The visuals are great - there's buried treasure, underground houses (located under a cemetery!), the cinematography is good, and the film is set in modern-day Calcutta (well it's 1982 of course). The actors do a good job. The three guys are great, the two girls (Zeenat Aman and Shoma Anand) look good. Pran and Amrish Puri are as always terrific in their respective roles and actually those whom I liked the most in this film. The best thing about the film is in my view R.D. Burman's exceptional soundtrack. The songs are fantastic - and I must note \"Aaj Ki Raat\" and \"Chor Tera Naam Hai\" which are my favourite. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this film, and I recommend this to those who enjoy Hindi commercial flicks."]},

Bundy is what true nightmares are made of, I would of loved to be the one frying him. The final words from that Judge left a lasting memory. Starting with a police shootout, and ending with John's Lennon's vigil, TKOA is that truly one time shockomentary pic, where age in no way has dampened it's impact. Like a scar, it never gets smaller, or goes away. It's there for life. This is the lasting impact has. This well made doco, is not one I'd opt to watch again.

Asha runs away after she discovers that the two men have cooked up a fiendish plot to get their hands on her sizable inheritance.

The movie has subplot involving a friend of Ashok's named Mahesh (popular comedian Mehmood) who comes to Tokyo to marry a woman from a higher class.

However it's important to remember that Bollywood is not Hollywood and moviegoers in each country have different expectations.", "The film contains two of the most beloved songs from Indian cinema: \"Love in Tokyo\" by Rafi Mohamed and \"Sayonara\" by Lata Mangeshkar.

Rich girl poor boy. Conceited boy getting smitten by a simple girl or vice versa. We have seen so many stories in Indian movies. Such a hackneyed plot can also entertain when well-developed and skilfully presented on the screen. Magroor(1979) is one such movie only which is quite entertaining. It stars Shatrughan Sinha and Vidya Sinha in lead roles.", "Magroor(conceited / haughty) is the story of Ranjeet(Shatrughan Sinha) who is a rich businessman as well as a rich brat considering every girl as a sex-object and available against generous consideration. He is not having parents and in his house, he is surrounded by many relatives who are having no affection for him and are only greedy of his wealth. When a hotel receptionist Anju(Vidya Sinha) hurts his ego, he gets her expelled from her job. Still when she is not ready to bow before the might of his wealth, then he decides to get her through a scheme. Entering into a bet with his good-for-nothing friends in this regard, he approaches Anju under the fake identity of a motor-mechanic Raaju and starts wooing her while working as the assistant of his inefficient motor-mechanic brother Raakesh(Paintal). Gradually he is not only able to win Anju's heart but loses his own heart also to her. Now he is no longer after her body but wants to make her his life partner. However Anju who has never seen Ranjeet in his true self, still hates him for getting her expelled from the job. Ranjeet alias Raaju also comes to know that due to his mistake only, the little sister of Anju and Raakesh had lost her voice. Pent-up by his guilty conscience, now he wants to bring the voice of the little girl back as his penitence. However by this time, already a large conspiracy has started against him in his home for the sake of his wealth. Ranjeet is aware of the conspiracy but not the mastermind behind that. Everything is set right in the climax.", "The story of Magroor has been written nicely and despite lifting many things from different Bollywood movies, it renders a feeling of novelty also when its rom-com track takes off. The romantic track of Anju and Raaju(Ranjeet in disguise) is hilarious as well as touching. This part of the movie has a repeat value also. However the writer(K.K. Shukla) and director(Brij) could not resist the temptation of giving the final reels of the movie the form of a suspense-thriller. This part though interesting and intriguing(because of the suspense regarding the identity of the mastermind of the conspiracy against the hero) spoils the pleasure of watching a good rom-com.", "Many characters of the movie(who are the greedy relatives of the rich hero) have been introduced in the opening but their roles get activated much later in the movie which is a flaw of the screenplay. The entry scene of the hero is good. And the ending scene showing the union of the hero and the heroine, deserves a lot of applause.", "By the time of this movie, Shatrughan Sinha who used to do negative roles in the initial few years of his acting career, has established himself as a hero in Bollywood. In a scene, this fact has been highlighted through his dialogs only that he's no longer a villain and turned into a hero. I found it as ridiculous but his admirers may find it hilarious.", "Technically the movie is okay. Due to poor quality film used for the movie, the colours of the prints now available for watching have faded a lot. Laxmikant Pyarelaal have composed ordinary music for the movie.", "Shatrughan Sinha has done well in the title role with his mannerismic performance which had become the trademark of his personality during his heyday making him immensely popular in the Indian movie buffs. Vidya Sinha was the perfect girl next door in the Bollywood movies during the seventies. She was a good actress who seldom disappointed in the role of a simple, middle class girl. Here also she fits the bill. Paintal has done good comedy. Great actress Naadira is simple brilliant in the emotional role of the Christian landlady of the heroine and her brother. All others are routine. Dr. Shreeraam Laagoo is a cut above the rest in the supporting cast.", "All in all, Magroor is an interesting flick which will be liked by both the romantic movie buffs as well as the crime-thriller fans. Overall it's a one time watch but, as said earlier also, the reels devoted to the rom-com portion can be watched and enjoyed more than once."]},

As per Ovid's narrative poem - Metamorphoses, Pygmalion was a sculptor who fell in love with the idol of a woman he had carved out of ivory. Taking an inspiration from the character of that sculptor, renowned playwright George Bernard Shaw wrote a play titled as Pygmalion in 1912 which was a sarcastic commentary on the British society and culture as prevailing in that period. In that play, Professor Henry Higgins enters into a bet with a friend of his that he can turn a bedraggled girl from the lower strata of the society into such a well-cultured girl wearing a veneer of gentility that she will pass for a duchess at a party hosted by an ambassador. And he actually succeeds in doing so by turning a flower girl - Eliza Doolittle into a well-mannered lady who by all means appears to belong to aristocracy and therefore acceptable in the so-called high society and thus wins the bet. But this girl is a flesh and blood human-being and not a lifeless idol as made by Pygmalion. She has a heart filled with womanly feelings. Can she be discarded now and thrown back to the class that she was initially picked from ? ", "Inspired by this play, a movie was made in Hollywood. This movie is My Fair Lady (1964) starring Rex Harrison in the role of Professor Henry Higgins and Audrey Hepburn in the role of Eliza Doolittle. This highly acclaimed movie won 8 Oscar awards and many other different awards. Producer Amit Khanna and director Basu Chatterjee made the Indianized version of this story taking Dev Anand and Tina Munim in lead roles. This Hindi movie is Manpasand (1980).", "Manpasand (favourite / pet) is the story of two Mumbai (then Bombay) based close friends who are bachelors and active in the line of music - Prataap (Dev Anand) and Kaashinaath (Girish Karnaad). Prataap happens to enter into a bet with Kaashinaath that he can turn a poor, uneducated and uncultured girl into a polished and graceful one as well as a skilled singer within just a timespan of six months. Kaashinaath agrees under the same bet that if Prataap is able to do so, he will marry that girl unconditionally and without any hitch. Prataap picks up a girl Kamli (Tina Munim) for this purpose whom he happens to come across in a local train when he finds her selling Datoons (indigenous tooth-brushes made of margosa branches). Kamli's good-for-nothing father (Mehmood) is kept at bay by these two gentlemen by paying money to him and Kamli is brought to Prataap's home. Now both the friends become Kamli's teachers. Prataap is acerbic and authoritarian in his approach whereas Kaashinaath is soft-spoken and gentle in his dealings with her. She learns classical music (covering singing and playing lute) from Prataap. From Kaashinaath, she learns etiquette, correct way of talking and cultured behaviour.", "The day comes when Kamli performs before a large audience and wins lots of accolades. From every angle, now she looks an elite lady and nobody present in the event is able to make even the wildest guess as to what she has been originally. Quite naturally, Prataap has won the bet against Kaashinaath and Kaashinaath too, being very happy at the development, is having no issues regarding marrying Kamli. However in the euphoria of their success, they completely forget the hard work and toil invested by Kamli in her transformation. Prataap disregards Kamli's feelings also. A disheartened Kamli leaves his house and moves out of his life. Later Kaashinaath feels that Prataap has unknowingly fallen in love with Kamli. He releases Prataap from the bet and asks him to accept Kamli and her sentiments for him. However Kamli has already left. The story concludes on a happy note.", "Doing justice to great plots is no easy thing. It demands a lot of effort, care and patience. Plus casting is also a significant factor. For great stories, the casting should be done after investing a lot of thought, else the result can be a disaster. The maker and the director of Manpasand seem to have faltered in this regard. This movie is not a disaster or a crap. It does not live up to the expectation or come anywhere near to My Fair Lady all the same.", "The script-writer could not prepare a very interesting script. In the ending reels, the movie becomes heavy with sentiments. However the seasoned director Basu Chatterjee has not allowed the movie to go too much awry.", "Music director Rajesh Roshan has prepared average compositions for most of the songs. Two songs are Indianized versions of the English songs composed by Frederick Loewe viz. Hothon Pe Geet Jaage is based on the tune of 'I could have danced all night' and Rehni Ko Ek Ghar Hoga is based on the tune of 'Wouln't it be loverly'. Other than these songs, Charu Chandra Ki Chanchal Chitvan only appears okay, Kishore Kumar's song - Manmaani Se Hargiz Na Daro is humorous though. Rest all the songs are passable. Amit Khanna's lyrics are good.", "Dev Anand and Tina Munim are completely miscast in the lead roles. The faulty casting is one of the reasons which has let this movie down. Only the renowned Indian author, playwright, actor and theatre personality - Girish Karnaad has done full justice to the role of Kaashinaath. Mehmood and others are routine.", "As said earlier, Manpasand is a lost opportunity because a great plot could not be converted into an admirable movie. However since this movie is not a bad movie either, I recommend it to those who like emotion-soaked dramas. Evergreen hero Dev Anand was fading out fast at the time of making of this movie which can be considered as one of his last movies which are worth a mention. Hence his (huge) fan-following also can give it a dekko."]},

It probably helps if you are a general fan of horror films from all eras, as this is pure 80s. It has none of the superficial and formulaic surface noise that constitutes the cinematic vernacular of the modern 'horror' blockbuster. No back-lit trees; dry ice; or glossy, glamorous young leads screaming their pretty heads off. Instead, you get a fairly gritty and atmospheric offering based on a relatively original premise. Yes, there is the classic 80s/horror staple of the obnoxious pair of punks who are just begging to be killed off. In fact, you would be hard pressed to find a bigger dick, more deserving of supernatural death, than the leader of this punk duo. He is hilarious, and probably the weakest part of the film; although 80s afficionados can certainly enjoy his character for what it is. Also, there is suspect dubbing and acting, but that's just par for the course. I was never bored during this film, and I think a main factor in this is that there are many characters involved in the plot, and the director has done a very economical job of providing just enough involvement and back-story for each to move the film along nicely, yet still involve them in the narrative. Not hugely gory, but there are some good set pieces; and some foxy (in my book) women half naked. This is never a bad thing. Overall, a decent flick - I enjoyed it more than I thought I would. If you are a genre fan, and especially like 80s horror, then seek this out."]},

When one watched Victor's movies it's rather funny how common the films were between father and son because they were often made for a popular genre (silent Western/drive-in horror) and on very small budgets. The story here is rather straight and simple as Art Mix plays a cowboy who saves a young woman and her father on a coach through Oregon. Years later he's working in a rodeo show when he comes across the father and daughter again but this time they're fighting with some bandits so sure enough Mix agrees to help. At just 41-minutes this film is ultra cheap and right to the point as the screenplay doesn't allow for too much plot. In fact, this film pretty much goes from A to Z without any sort of plot twists or anything else because it's clear Adamson was just wanting to get anything on film and into theaters. So, how is the picture? I'd have a hard time recommending it to anyone unless they simply have to see every Western ever made during the silent era. This is certainly far from a bad movie but at the same time there's not an ounce of quality seen anywhere and with so many better Westerns out there it's really not hard telling someone to skip this one. The one saving grace and the only reason I'd recommend people to check this out is for the beautiful locations. This was shot in Oregon (a couple posts at IMDb give different actual locations) and the scenery is downright breathtaking during certain moments. At the start there's a lot of scenes looking down a cliff to a valley and some more stuff dealing with the mountains and rivers. All of this looks wonderful well and one really wishes that Adamson would have just shot a nature documentary and let the silly action for a different movie."]},

As far as love is concerned, it may happen at any stage of a person's life. It is said that love just happens, not deliberately accomplished (Pyaar Kiya Nahin Jaata, Ho Jaata Hai). Hence whatever is your age or situation, you are destined to fall in love with someone of opposite sex, you can't do anything about it. You may not express your love to him or her but love for him or her is bound to exist in your heart.", "But marriage ? Marriage is an altogether different business. Why ? Because marriage involves commitment, marriage calls for shouldering responsibility and marriage means a life-long association with the spouse. It is much more than love and hence marriage cannot just happen. It is to be carried out deliberately after investing a lot of thought in the decision. That's why, when a male or a female is past his / her reasonable age to enter into wedlock, the decision to marry someone is not that easy even when the concerned person is in love. You may be an eligible bachelor or an eligible maiden but if your age does not entitle you to be called a boy or a girl, then ? ", "Prem Vivah (1979) is a family drama that deals with this issue. As the title suggests, the story involves both love (Prem) and marriage (Vivah). ", "The story deals with the life of four characters only. Asha Parekh and Bindiya Goswami are two unmarried sisters. Bindiya is quite young whereas Asha is well past her marriageable age. Their parents being dead long back, Asha has been more like a mother to Bindiya than her elder sister and for the sake of fostering her only, she had neglected the issue of her own marriage. Now Bindiya herself has attained marriageable age and she is in love with an eligible bachelor Mithun Chakraborty. The twist in the tale comes with the entry of a mature-age bachelor Utpal Dutt.", "Utpal Dutt who is almost double the age of Bindiya Goswami, comes across her and falls for her charms. However he is under a false impression that Bindiya also loves him whereas the fact is that Bindiya only respects him. Through Bindiya, he is introduced to her elder sister Asha Parekh. Now with his regularly meeting the sisters renders an impression to them that he is in love with Asha. Asha also starts liking him and starts dreaming to marry him when her younger sister ties the sacred knot with her beau. Misunderstandings continue and when the truth dawns upon the characters of this story, the issues has become too complicated to handle. Since Mithun Chakraborty has to move abroad after marrying Bindiya who is ambivalent due to being concerned for her elder sister; it's Utpal only who has to take a compromising decision to cope with this cruel jest that destiny has cracked on them, especially him.", "Personally I believe and almost everybody will agree to it that if at all one has to marry, he / she should ensure that the marriage takes place at an appropriate age. However now the trend is that people continue to remain unmarried till they are in their thirties. Well, late marriages bring many problems with them but the other side of the picture is equally important. Since a majority of marriages in India are more or less a gamble with life (one may win, one may lose), if someone waits for Mr. Right or Miss Right, there is no harm because bachelorhood is a much better option that remaining unhappy after marriage and restlessly longing to break free from its shackles.", "The second issue is the love emerging for someone who is much younger or much older in age. In this movie, mainly the complication is due to Utpal Dutt's attraction for a much younger Bindiya Goswami who cannot guess in the wildest of her dreams that Utpal visits their family for the sake of his love for her only and always remains under the impression that his feelings are for her elder sister who belongs to his age-group. Well, in my humble opinion, in such a situation, the concerned people should not allow any communication gap to creep in and give rise to misunderstandings. Communication gap is a highly undesirable thing when it comes to relationships. Straightforward talks should take place and everything should be clarified without a hitch, else things can go from bad to worse only.", "The movie has been directed by Basu Chatterjee very well but being a serious movie, it's not the cup of tea of those who watch movies for fun. There remains an undercurrent of tension in the later half of the movie and this tension makes the movie burdensome. Only those who are able to relate to any of the characters and the situations shown, may find themselves as engrossed. Though the curiosity regarding the climax remains, it is more or less a forgone conclusion.", "The narrative has been lifted by the admirable performances of the lead actors. All the four principal artists have delivered mature performances as per the demand of the story.", "All in all, Prem Vivah deals with a significant issue but does not offer any solution. Even when a person (male or female) remains unmarried till his / her forties, the age does not affect the tender feelings for someone which may emerge at any stage of life because human-beings are bound to love because they need love for them too. However marriage may be performed as a compromise with life. In my opinion, the challenge which is much bigger that making this compromise, is to love the person whom you have married without love. It may prove to be a Herculean task but it is mandatory if the marital life is to survive."]},

But the story stands for symbolism to the increasing violence, crimes in the city for which the film deserves an attention.

Perhaps the content won't be suitable to be watched with family. It manages to grip and comes close to an intense thriller. The special mention needs to go to the powerful performances given by Sujata Mehta and Rohini Hattangadi in their central roles. Besides, it would be unfair not to mention Nana Patekar in his earlier yet one of his best performances. Most of his dialogues make a satire to the current politics. Despite a non salable cast, the film manages to grip. Overall, the film raises the voices against the increasing crime and violence in the country and hints the unwillingness of the law and order to terminate it.", "Anyway, I have a reservation for this movie; and it's the lack of reality to the story which views the story in a fairy land where only a single mobster has the power to terrify the whole city with his fury. Perhaps the law and order of a city at present may not be that lame as portrayed in the film. Had the story been a bit real to life, \"Pratighaat\" would have been a remarkable film to be remembered for years. For a general watch, the film is gripping, intense and disturbing that you may not want to miss.", "Rating: 2 stars out of 4"]},

His father, recently released from prison, wants him to get a \"respectable\" job down at the local mob hangout and arranges to have the local mobster Nicky Nuts (Tartaglia's electrician uncle Domenick in an amazing performance) employ him as errand boy. He turns out to be good at his job, and as his star rises he is torn between the Italian old school grown-up world and his peers in the more racially-integrated hip hop crowd. Ronald Samuel Jacobs plays Angelo, a thuggish John Gotti wannabe whose desperate efforts to pay a debt to Nicky Nuts cause him to cross paths with Anthony and Anthony is forced to make a life-changing decision.", "Like the streets it was shot on, Punctuality is gritty. Acting sometimes is subpar although other times it's impressive. As the tagline suggests, this is Tartaglia's directing debut and sometimes it shows. The dialog is full of Italian South Philadelphia colloquialisms, and at times it is deliriously profane. The soundtrack is eclectic, including old school South Philly crooner Fabian, some impressive hip-hop freestylers, and Philadelphia punk legend Mikey Wild. The movie won audience favorite awards at several film festivals, but at 54 minutes running time and padded as it is, it didn't get picked up by distributors looking for feature length projects.", "Punctuality was ahead of its time. These days, with digital video and You Tube, it could have been self-produced and self-distributed for even less money or even put online like fellow Philadelphia student film maker Maya Churi did with her feature Letters From Home Room not two years later.", "As for the Tartaglias, the gentrification of their old neighborhood hasn't driven them away. They are still there on 9th Street, and many members of the cast are still living and working there too (the guy who played short-tempered gangster Big Frankie is actually a cheerful friendly guy). They've opened up a theatre in their mother's old storefront, where they showcase local talent. If you catch him in between booking acts, Joe Tartaglia will be happy to sell you a copy of Punctuality for around five bucks, or will give it to you for free if he's in a good mood."]},

Dumped in the desert, the thief covers his marking with a headscarf and goes to the nearest village where he is taken in by a trusting family in return for his work. However, has be actually changed or is he still the same thief at heart?", "Continuing my self righteous rant that short films are not only worth seeing but are a great way of seeing future talent, comes this short film that was made by Kapadia a few years before he came to everyone's attention with his critically acclaimed 'The Warrior'. This film is set in the same sort of India that that was set as well as The Detour, which Kapadia also produced recently. Here we follow a young thief in a story that is quite slow and quite unsure of itself  is he trying to start over, or look for more chances to steal? It isn't made totally clear and is quite open and helps cover the fact that it is slow  it's a bit dull at times but it is thoughtful enough to cover this.", "The cast are all pretty good and seem natural enough, although I'm not sure if they were all playing themselves or if they were actors brought in. Also the lack of dialogue means that they have less to convince with  perhaps making their task a little easier. The direction is good and the film feels very professional, looking good from start to finish. It may have been a little slow and bordering on being dull at one or more point but generally it is a very atmospheric and professional short film that has a real sense of place and time  worth seeing and yet another example of how short films are always worth seeing because you never know where the makers are going to be a few years hence."]},

The film follows this case and at the same time shows his young wife Manisha's doubts and attempts to find out the truth. Whether Dinesh is really guilty or not is a question that remains unanswered until the very final scene of the film. The film is directed by Basu Chatterjee, the one who made many great films and whose style has often resembled the style of Hrishikesh Mukherjee's film-making. In this one the director also tries to make this film authentic, but the film is not very convincingly done although the story is excellent and the message it conveys is good. Some of the flashbacks do not really make sense, the way the story unfolds is a bit too dragged, and the development is unclear and confusing. The portrayal of the relationship between Dinesh and Manisha as a married couple is also pretty flawed. The acting is average to okay. Mithun plays a very ordinary kind of a fellow, Moon Moon Sen is beautiful but her acting is average, and Mallika Sarabhai is okay as the prosecutor. The film's biggest surprise is the ending which manages to leave a mark despite the otherwise mediocre movie. Sheesha is a disappointment though it's definitely watchable for its story and unlike most Hindi movies, it's actually not too long."]},

But the most interesting aspect of this film is that it is some sort of Indo-Iranian collaboration from 1972, and so features Iranian women in fashionable Western outfits! Thus it's an interesting reminder of the Iran that Marjane Satrapi recalls in Persepolis. And there's a sudden shift in the film into documentary mode, with some footage of a stunning mosque and a voice over introducing it to audiences! Apart from that it's fairly insipid; it's also about the meeting of cultures and the problems of inter-community marriage (dealing with its impossibility) and the con man with the heart of gold (played by Sanjeev Kumar). I haven't seen the movie in its entirety, and quite frankly I'm not interested either; but it's got some good things going for it, if your thing is to sort through the mire of Hindi popular cinema history and seek the good things, because one isn't really sure if they themselves felt like part of a film-making culture that cared to focus their good aspects with a lot of self-reflection into coherent attempts at good stuff. Strangely enough, some of the cinematography is brilliant. The most remarkable thing of me writing this response to the film is that I cannot find absolutely anything about this film on the internet -- and hardly anything about its director Tapi Chanakya. I can only piece together from his filmography that he is Telugu, having done a lot of Telugu films. And that he died in 1973, but 1971 and '72 were remarkably good years for him. So it looks like he must've died around his peak. Pardon me, this is a highly uninformed opinion. The point however is how little there is of this film and so little of so many films in fact. And while this film isn't exactly remarkable, the fact that this film is so completely forgotten in today's era is remarkable too. It reminds me of how when Lagaan didn't win the Best Foreign Film Oscar, the following day's headlines read: \"Lagaan fails to win at Oscars\". And that you could still have a long conversation about how great a film like Sholay is. True true, but without the act of remembering, recalling and reflecting, the history of Bollywood is incomplete, and an incomplete history cannot produce complete masters. And on a more macrocosmic level, an Indo-Iranian joint collaboration from 1972, five years before the Cultural Revolution?! For that alone, this film is a remarkable document. Now I'm going to post this comment and turn off the TV, because I've gotta leave and do something, which is more important than me watching the rest of this film right now. Will I be able to get a DVD of this film easily? I heavily doubt it!!!"]},

I saw it at a short film production seminar in the mid-1990s, where it was introduced by the commissioning editor for '10x10', the BBC strand that financed the production and originally broadcast it.", "The script fizzes with such originality that at first it occurs to you that it's an extended sketch with very high production values, but very quickly the character and pathos of the subject takes over, and you are drawn in to a world that has utterly vanished from England, the end-of-the-pier variety turn.", "Affectingly shot in black and white, the film is set in Blackpool (Chelsom's hometown, and location of his later 'Funny Bones'), and follows the self-doubting grandson (Tomkinson, excellent) of a popular - but recently deceased - music hall entertainer, who has plans to follow him onto the stage. This summary is really all the story that there is; The joy of the film is that by great writing and nuanced acting alone, the characters all share the seedy world of stalled ambition and jaded weariness that exists between close-knit 'theatrical entertainers' and their families.", "The title refers to a jokey double-entendre laden song that's energetically performed on-stage by Tomkinson in the finale. There is no better calling-card to the big boys than a compact, spare and utterly compelling movie about quirky people and real emotions, and this film has it in spades, so why is our movie business utterly obsessed with features?", "If you're at all interested in making short films or just writing them, take a look at this short and witness how performance and script can be whole lot more dramatic and emotionally engaging than plot or action. Perhaps the only downside to note is that Chelsom, like Bruce Robinson, hasn't followed his amazing debut with a successful career and dazzling celebrity. Still, if he never exposes another frame, at least he made Treacle."]},

The film gets straight to the point right after the principle characters are introduced. Chatterjee tells an engaging story that keeps the viewer. It's also interesting to see how he cast the same actors in different roles of the present setting and the past life. However, the writing is faulty at places and the end looks very rushed. Ashok Kumar's doctor character suffers from poor writing. The role lacks dimension and it only confuses the viewer on how he knows so much about Gauri and Gangadhar. It's quite a pity because this character presents the turning point of 'Tumhare Liye'. Chatterjee cleverly balances the contrast between the modern day and the early 1900s very well. Not only does one see a difference in clothing and setting but even the actors have displayed different gestures and attitude that separate the time. Sanjeev Kumar is excellent as the modern husband who is sexually frustrated and confused so much that he almost rapes his wife. He is equally convincing as the calm and peaceful monk Gangadhar. Vidya Sinha too is incredible as the possessed wife and the vivacious village belle. An average actress could have easily messed up the role of the confused, terrified and depressed wife but this actress knows her craft well enough to pull it off. Ashok Kumar is adequate as Gauri's village uncle but as the doctor he is letdown by lack of character dimension. Neelam Mehra holds her own. Jaidev's music is great. Om Shivpuri is hilarious as the stoned monk. It's not an out and out comic role but the comedy of it is more subtle. The songs are hummable and suit the situation. Cinematography is brilliant as the camera is used very effectively. To conclude, 'Tumhare Liye' tells an interesting story but the film itself could have been a tad better if the writing was a little more solid. Nonetheless it's worth a watch because of everything I mentioned above. However, it might not appeal to everyone, particularly those who do not enjoy movies with the reincarnation theme."]},

Sholay is a great example in my opinion. Neither its writers (Salim-Javed), nor its director (Ramesh Sippy) had thought during its making that they were going to make a timeless classic. They were only making a multi-starrer formula movie whose plot was also not original. However by default, everything fell just in place in the movie and it became something outstanding. A similar thing seems to have happened with Victoria No. 203 which had been made by the director Brij Sadanaah in 1972, taking Navin Nischal and Saira Banu in romantic leads.", "Director Brij had perhaps a fancy for involvement of diamonds in the plot of his movies as many of his movies are regarding theft of diamond or diamonds. Anyway, there was a set pattern in several Bollywood movies of the sixties and the seventies that a crime based story was taken, showing triumph of good over evil in the end, inter-mixing one comedy plot and one romantic plot (with some songs) in between plus applying a Tadka of some emotion and some action to the dish and then supposing it to be delicious for two and half hours entertainment for the Indian audience who was supposed to be habituated of seeing such so called social thrillers. Victoria No. 203 was no exception but the comedy track interwoven in the crime based plot superseded everything else by default and that played magic with this ordinary movie.", "I am not trying to take away the credit from the director. In fact, the intelligent casting of the comedians was that x-factor which made the movie extra-ordinary. While making selection for the pair of two aged friends, getting in and out of jail every now and then, the director made a very intelligent decision, virtually a masterstroke which made this movie a winner. The first selection was Ashok Kumar, the legendary Dada Muni of Bollywood who was always kept in such high esteem by the filmmakers that whosoever might be in the lead roles, his name was displayed first in the credits. And the second one was Pran, the quintessential Bollywood villain who was so much hated by the audience due to his baddie roles that for around two decades, people had stopped keeping the name of a newborn as Pran. Comedy ! By these two ! Something beyond imagination at that time. But it happened and it became the USP of this movie forever.", "The story is regarding the theft of diamonds from a museum which due to multiple crosses taken place between the criminals, led to hiding of the diamonds by the dying thief in a Victoria (horse-driven rickshaw in Mumbai in those times) numbered as 203. The mastermind behind the theft is after them with his gang but destiny pulls two regular jail-birds of old age also into this crime-dynamics. In the end, the main villain is caught, the diamonds which are the national property, are found; the innocent father of our heroine who owns this Victoria is released from jail and one of the two aged friends (Pran) gets his lost son (our hero) who has been fostered by the villain for years. But in between, we have a two hours and odd minutes long laugh riot alongwith murders, chases and thrill.", "Ashok Kumar plays a skirt-chasing alcoholic with Pran as his somewhat sensible buddy. These two play so much with the funny bone of the audience during the movie that you just forget about the main plot and keep on laughing and enjoying with these two. The chemistry between these two aged protagonists is so amazing that it can only be felt by seeing on the screen, cannot be explained in words. Every now and then, you start laughing. The screenplay writer deserves full marks for writing genuine laughter-generating scenes for them and the director has demonstrated his better judgment by giving ample footage to this comedian duo. The full length song - Do Bechare, Bina Sahare is simply great to hear and more so to watch. This song itself is just like a short laughter show presented by Ashok Kumar and Pran.", "When I see slapstick comedies made in India, I start thinking about this movie which is a lesson in making comedy movies though category wise talking, it is a crime thriller. All the laughters generated are genuine and arise straight from your heart. Only this aspect has given this movie a repeat value and it can be watched for any number of times just for the laughing stock.", "Other than Ashok Kumar and Pran whose already decorated caps got another feather added by this movie, Naveen Nischal and Saira Banu have done well as the lead romantic pair. The baddies are OK alongwith the character and the child artists. Other than the already mentioned - Do Bechare, Bina Sahare; the songs of the movie are OK. The song in which Saira Banu induces Ranjeet, gives an erotic effect. The editor could not have done a better job as the regular formula movies were made in those times in such a way as to expand the plot on a two and half hours long canvas. Art direction and other technical aspects are also OK.", "Brij Sadanaah committed suicide in 1990 after allegedly killing his wife and daughter. His son Kamal remade Victoria No. 203 by taking Anupam Kher and Om Puri in the roles of Ashok Kumar and Pran but it did not work. ", "My verdict is - please watch this crime thriller for laughters of a life time. If you have not watched it, you are missing a very big laughter-treat."]},

Tim Dolan (Robert Floyd) is a handsome, sweet, and trusting young man who falls in love with a beautiful, intelligent and business-savvy woman who comes from a well-to-do family. What Tim Dolan doesn't know is that, in addition to his girlfriend's many assets, she also has a deep, dark and disturbing side that will cause the advent of Tim's eventual demise. The film illustrates a side of relationship violence rarely witnessed, except behind closed doors: when violence comes from the woman's end and not the man's. When He Didn't Come Home showcases a woman's inability to control her anger,but Carolyn's anger, Tim Dolan's girlfriend (played by Kelly Rowan) is no ordinary anger. Carolyn's fit of uncontrolable rages stem from famillial dysfunction, one that has long infiltrated her own family for some time. Carolyn's own mother and father co-exist in this kind of dysfunctional relationship, where the mother's rage controls an effeminate husband's incapabilty at resisting a harpy of woman's reign over an entire family. The film is also an excellent example of primetime Lifetime Movie Network potential, as well as an excellent vehicle to showcase Patty Duke's depth as an actor who is capable of the lightest demeanor when she's trusting, to the most disturbed, painful state of mind that only a mother suffers when her beloved child finds a most terrible fate."]},

Was it worth the effort? Very definitely.", "'Channelling Baby' is a complex film that takes a very adult look at loss and separation, and examines the way that we deal as human beings with traumatic events through the presentation of conflicting memories and layers of truth surrounding the disappearance many years ago of the baby of the title. The interplay between it's four main characters maintains a high level of tension throughout, and although the events portrayed verge on melodrama, the emotional tone stays very much in the real world: the enduring images of the movie, alternating between the stunningly beautiful and the unbearably poignant, have the power to reach all of us because they speak of the universal themes of hope and despair.", "Much of the cast, especially the four leads, will be familiar to fans of Renaissance Pictures 'Hercules: The Legendary Journeys' and 'Xena: Warrior Princess,'American productions that were filmed in New Zealand between 1994-2001 - Kevin Smith, Joel Tobeck and Danielle Cormack all had recurring parts on the shows, and Amber Sainsbury also made several guest appearances. Here we get the chance to see them in very different roles, and to people who haven't previously explored the richness of New Zealand moviemaking, the experience should be an enlightening one. all give excellent good accounts of themselves, and show an impressive range of talents. But this is also very much a film of technical achievement - the cinematography of Rewa Harre is on several occasions quite breathtaking, and there is a wonderful use of colour as subtextual reinforcement of narrative shifts in time and mood; Chris Plummer's editing is also extremely successful in keeping the audience slightly unsettled, as we undergo rapid and provocative shifts from scene to scene.", "The film nevertheless belongs to its writer and director Christine Parker, who has given us a truly exciting first full-length work that strikes us both at gut level, pulling few punches (I laughed and cried, and it's been a long time since one movie provoked both reactions in me); and which is also intellectually satisfying. I've worked in the field of mental health all of my adult life, and this film said more to me about the experience of managing psychological pain than any other work I can remember having seen. Brava.", "I would not be true to my obsession with Danielle Cormack if I didn't give her some special mention, however! She gives a stunning performance and convinces as a blind woman (no easy task)whose life takes bewildering twists and turns; and she is never less than movingly plausible as she demonstrates almost the whole range of human emotion within Parker's highly literate script. In a movie of many wonderful moments, one scene in particular stands out, beautifully directed and deeply affecting to watch, as Cormack stumbles into the garden of her home and holds her baby up to the sun, begging the universe to notice the child and give to her what she needs. It's an image that will stay with me for a very long time, and exemplifies a film that should be widely seen."]},

Princess Rune is now younger and the object of Makoto's affections, while the demon goddess Ifurita is now a dizzy screw-up. The world of El Hazard still looks gorgeous - with breath-taking vistas of mountains and river valleys, lush forests and oddball alien creatures - plus a few background vistas of the Bugrom homeland which frankly look cheap. ", "The action animation is quite well done, too. Everything is a bit slower moving, as the story has 26 episodes to play out over rather than seven, and consequently lacks the all-stops-out action appeal of the OAVs, but it at least does not leave the audience thinking MOVE dangit, as so many anime TV series now do. (Have Japanese animators completely given up on the idea of making characters move around? Is it all just sassy posturing and blowing hair now?) ", "The first three episodes introduce the key characters and situations and deviate little from the OAVs. The next three episodes introduce the three priestesses one at a time in slightly different fashion from the earlier series, but only episode six seemed truly fresh. At this point everything starts to get away from the story line of the original OAV series enough that it begins to take on a flavor of its own. Back as Makoto's would be rival is Napoleon wannabe Jinnai, who hatches plot after plot to conquer El Hazard and humiliate Makoto, despite the fact that they keep going awry! Then Jinnai and his allies the Bugrom search for ancient weapons of mass destruction, to force El Hazard to capitulate to him or be destroyed! ", "The expanded story line deviates even farther from the original series here, but some of the new choices made are a little less interesting. Plus, a few one-shot episodes are thrown in to round things out, although these tend to work less well, since the real appeal of a series like this is a grand, season-long plot line. No new regular characters get added at this point and some of the background animation is beginning to look a bit cheesy, as if the artists were having trouble keeping up with the production schedule. ", "All-in-all, this is a good-looking and enjoyable series both for fans of El Hazard and those new to the franchise, and in fact it might even play better among those who have NOT seen El Hazard, The zaniness, though, feels at times forced and the whole show has a more camp comedy approach than the earlier OAV series, which featured a more balanced approach between drama and silliness. ", "Recommended largely for its great fantasy look."]},

Espionage, murder, robbery, international intrigue and Nick Craig was always there.Great to see so many British upcoming actors, Honor Blackman, Douglas Wilmer, Roger Delgado, John Cairney, William Hartnell, so many more.The entire series has now been released on DVD in the U.K. I recommend it strongly to the t.v. collector.The second series gave Craig a new boss , Donald Wolfit was gone. Neil Hallett came in as another agent and his stories generally rotated with Craig's.It's still a good show but the loss of quality really does show on video tape.Michael Quinn was an American actor with only a few bit parts to his name when he landed the lead. In the beginning his inexperience shows but to his credit he vastly improves quickly and for me despite other actors appearing as agents , Craig is always the interesting one.Neil Hallett is fine and probably the better actor of the two. However there is something about Quinn as Nick Craig that really does convey the life of a lonely agent.Some sources state that Craig is blown up in the episode \"A first class way to die\". This is untrue, he is alive and well at the end of series 2.However when the series returned a year later under the title, GS.5 , Nick Craig was gone and Miller ( Neil Hallett) sets out to avenge his death, but Craig's demise is never shown to the audience. Was Quinn dropped or did he leave? We shall never know.Quinn went back to America and only managed small roles in shows like Bewitched and Dallas. I have heard he then went to Australia and appeared in Neighbours as a doctor. I have been unable to verify this, so if anyone could help, please do let me know.Would be interesting to know if he is still alive, if he is it seems a shame he is not there giving a commentary on a landmark t.v. series.Ghost Squad was the first British one hour dramatic show and to this day the majority of the stories stand up well, give it a whirl."]},

Scott Bakula, one of my favorite performers, never has ceased to amaze me in his work (ok, fine--I didn't like \"Lord of Illusions\").  I found him particularly appealable, much different from how the novel describes Alex Michaels (lady-wooer).  Bakula embodies that typical average-guy look that I love, and those biceps and pecs in the tigh t-shirts drove me wild.

You can see they get along ok, a departure from the books.  Jay Gridley is EXACTLY what I expected, not too nerdy looking, but certainly smart (the part in the VR Brothel was hysterical).

When the driver kept saying sir to him, Alex asked him if he could make a suggestion, the driver said \"Sir yes sir\" and alex said \"Lighten up.\"  You don't get much more comic timing than that.  Bakula actually had some really funny lines, but you gotta break the tension somewhere.  My favorite scenes were the action scenes, particularly Alex's fight with the paid femme fatale.", "This is a great film with a great plot, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.

Both older sisters clash, the mother is in a state, Ken is as bad a ToolTime Tim Taylor, Carol is fuelling her Olympic desire and Chrissy is aware all of this is to be splashed on national tv - why shouldn't she be embarrassed? It is great to see some famous New Zealand faces perform in the suburban comedy that has witty lines to spare. I loved the sparring between Jen and Lyn. One is like an adult Mona-my-biological-clock-is-ticking-away, the other a narcisstic tramp who has what her sister desires - a bun in the oven.

Veteran Hindi film producer & director B. R. Chopra (in his directorial debut) along with another veteran, I. S. Johar (who wrote the screenplay adaptation without crediting the source), put forth a mesmerizing Hindi film noir with AFSANA. Why this veteran team remade this very film as DASTAAN (1972) 20 years later defies reason. The remake was so incredibly inferior in comparison in spite of the presence of the Tragedy King of Hindi cinema Dilip Kumar. ", "AFSANA was arguably the last major role as a heroine of actress Veena before her screen career gradually slipped into supporting roles. This was mainly due to the fact that Veena was such a class act that she was really incapable of performing silly song-and-dance routines which became the standard of Hindi films. Keeping this in mind, B. R. Chopra did 2 things which the Hindi cinema audience longed to see: (1) Veena playing a truly vulnerable, mournful character that was a total 180 degree opposite turn from her dragon lady role in the ironically titled DASTAN from the previous year (1950). (2) Veena had played the romantic interest of Ashok Kumar in the 1943 classic NAJMA, in which they play soulful lovers who end up marrying other partners which left audiences unfulfilled. AFSANA was the long overdue film which fulfilled the unfulfilled: Ashok Kumar & Veena playing characters which reunite with each other. Had any other actress been cast in the role of the heroine of this film, this would have indeed been considered a rather bland, depressing part. However, B. R. Chopra remedied this by capturing some of the best screen shots of Veena: She never looked more breathtakingly gorgeous than in this film. An East Indian version of a cross between Paulette Goddard & Hedy Lamarr. ", "Ashok Kumar proved in this film that he could stand on par with the upcoming Hindi film superstars Dilip Kumar, Raj Kapoor, and Dev Anand, who were clearly his junior and undoubtedly inspired by him. His acting talent is equally matched by his charismatic screen presence. Actress Kuldip Kaur had the role to die for in this film and she makes the most of it. Pran is excellent in this film and displays something he almost never had a chance to: An antagonist who is vulnerable. One of Pran's finest roles. And it is a real treat to see the often sinister & devious Jeevan portray a light, comical role in which he has some real scene-stealing dialogue. ", "What B. R. Chopra achieved in this film begs the question: What happened to him later on in his career as a filmmaker? Directing all those masala potboilers which only had commercial value but very little artistic value. But in this film, B. R. Chopra and I. S. Johar really brought forth a hypnotic tale in AFSANA...65 years later, this film holds the viewer spellbound. An unmistakable testament as to what B. R. Chopra was capable of accomplishing."]},

However, this one was a complete departure from the story that I and little girls around the world had grown to love.  Where the first two movies were laden with episodes from the books, the third movie had nothing in common with the books at all.  Were we supposed to ignore the fact that by the time WWI rolled around, Anne's CHILDREN were old enough to fight?  According to Sullivan, while the rest of the world moved ahead about 20 years from the time of the bridge scene to the time the third film opens, Avonlea was stuck in a timewarp.  ", "Sullivan should have realized that the people who would have waited for a third film after 15 years were the ones who truly loved the Anne story. While the movie is able stand on its own as a love story between a woman named Anne and a man named Gilbert, those of us who waited deserved a continuation of the story L. M. Montgomery wrote.  Keeping close to the the first four books served Sullivan well when putting together the first two movies.  I for one would have loved to have met Captain Jim, Susan, and old Dr. Blythe; to be a part of a wedding that I have imagined from my childhood; and to see Anne and Gil experience the joys and sorrows of their House of Dreams.  Sullivan's decision to completely ignore the works of L. M. Montgomery is an insult to her memory, her work, and her fans."]},

I greatly admired her earnestness. People can think or dream up any number of ideas about you; they can accuse you of being a thief; or think lesser of you, but you have nothing to apologize for if you have always acted honestly. Anuschka was that all over; perhaps the embodiment of the \"country\" spirit, not corrupted by the city; and pure of heart. Perhaps, the \"city's aura\" or other's erroneous projections is what makes one feel less dignified, but then again, if you are truly a good person, like Anuschka, you have nothing to worry about."]},

Christopher Plummer's character added some levity that would have seemed awkward, but as the movie started to drag this performance became more appreciated.  The movie grabbed me early with Maria's performance, but later the story became more routine and even Maria's character couldn't add enough interest to keep it exciting."]},

Later on , there happens a relentless and merciless manhunt with unexpected consequences . A bloody gunfight ends the control of the band and he returns control of the town to its legitimate authorities .", "This mediocre Western packs a silly but well known plot , as a bounty hunter is hired with the subsequent vendetta and full of violence , shoot'em up and results to be briefly entertaining , though drags at times , balancing ups and downs . Average Spaghetti Western follows the Sergio Leone/Sergio Corbucci wake and it is proceeded in violent style . Short-budgeted Spaghetti Western in which an avenger gunfighter pursues a nasty band of outlaws who have been carrying out assaults , bank heists and murders . It's a thrilling but dumb western with deplorable performances and a ridiculously written storyline paced in fits and starts ; including a breathtaking confrontation between protagonist Jeff Cameron against his ominous enemies . This moving Ravioli Western packs thrills , shootouts , noisy action , chases , but being an inferior and twilight entry in this prolific Spaghetti genre . Italian production filmed in ordinary exteriors fron Lazio , Rome , being full of assaults , exaggerated characters , gun-down , lots of shots , fights and with some looks that say it all , including ending crossfire at a hacienda that is the best part of the movie . Starring Jeff Cameron is very mediocre , though stands out his strong , striking look , featuring as a gunslingerr going after a band of cutthroats . Cameron is so-so as a tough , laconic revenger pursuing an ominous group of Mexican attackers , as he ravages the screen , he stalks , watches , attacks , hits and runs ; besides , using a large arsenal of weaponry , such as Derringer pistol, shotguns, and knives with special mention for a crossbow .Worthwhile watching only for a demonstration of the confrontation between the two-fisted Jeff Cameron against the dangerous and ambitious killer bandits , but there lacks enough emotion for the entire duration of the movie . Stars Jeff Cameron , he was a Z-actor who played as main or secondary role in various Z- Spaghetti Westerns, credited as Nino Scarciofolo , Blond Mendez , Glen Fortel or Giovanni Scarciofolo, such as : También la carroña tiene un precio (1971), Passa Sartana... è l'ombra della tua morte (1969) and ...e vennero in quattro per uccidere Sartana! (1969) , Giù la testa... hombre , Straniero... fatti il segno della croce! (1968), Stranger Say Your Prayers , Today We Kill Tomorrow We Die , Nevada Kid and this Un bounty killer a Trinità(1972) that was his last Western until his early death in 1985 . Support cast is frankly regular , without the familiar secondary actors who usually show up at these oaters , though there some briefly known apperances from Attilio Dottesio , Carla Mancini and Antonio Cantafora who often used pseudonym Michael Coby .", "Here stands out the atmospheric musical score by Vasili Kojucharov with full of Spaghetti sounds in Ennio Morricone style .The motion picture was middlingly but professionally directed by Oscar Santaniello and uncredited by Joe D'Amato or Aristide Massaccessi who photographed too . Director Oscar Santaniello was usually a production manager and producer , shooting only this Western titled Un bounty killer a Trinità or A Bounty Killer for Trinity (1972) .

His first directing work was in 1972's low-budget Scansati... a Trinità arriva Eldorado (1972), co-directed by Diego Spataro, under the pseudonym Dick Spitfire, but it was a commercial failure.

According to the trivia page for this film, the title character (Pasquale Zagaria)shares the actual birth name of the actor playing him (Lino Banfi). For his sake, let's hope the rest of the film is not actually based on his life. For clarity's sake, from here on we will refer to the actor by his stage name. As 'Brigadiere' Pasquale Zagaria, Banfi plays a self confessed Master of Disguise who wants to be a crime solving detective, but has to settle for cases involving farm animals (which is presumably even more demeaning than being a 'pet detective'). Needles to say, he does not make much money.", "'Il Brigadiere' is supported by his adoring wife Roberta, aka 'Puppeta' (Francesca Romana Coluzzi), who practices yoga in trees and Kung Fu fighting everywhere else (a very popular craze around 1973). It is she who has all the brains in this outfit, as well as the brawn. Coluzzi towers over all the other people in the film (especialy the men), which in a comedy like this means she's strong enough to hit a nail in a wall with one bare hand. Allowed to wear sexy outfits for once (though not performing Kung Fu in a bikini as depicted on some poster art), here we see Francesca a few years before being degraded to supporting status, usually portraying the 'giant freak' that lesser men (often Lino Banfi) try to escape.", "When diamonds are found amongst chicken droppings, the Farm Yard Detective finally bumbles himself into the middle of a big investigation (though unknown to him both the police and the diamond smugglers view him as their patsy). Armed only with his 'courage' (as he puts it), a bunch of mostly unconvincing disguises and Inspector Clouseau clumsiness, Zagaria and Puppeta travel around in an absurdly tiny three wheeled car (she has to Rip the roof off in order to sit down). They follow a trail of mad cap set pieces involving a yacht, a motorcycle chase and getting lost amongst the catacombs of a convent (but not in that order). Of course by the end the crime does get solved, but Zagaria's part in bringing down the smuggling ring is too minimal to grant him any reward. He even ends up with less at the end than he had at the beginning. And that's what I love about these Italian comedies: they dare to be brutally honest to even their most beloved underdog protagonists: When your'e born to lose, the odds are forever against you.", "6 out of 10"]},

I will admit a few of the fight scenes are a bit over the top, but it is that kind of film. I do think it is extremely violent, but this is a good thing, since the villains killed Casanovas parents when he was a kid and while he was watching, and it is very clear that they have no redeeming qualities.

Dealing with a stranger gunfighter and a Mexican bandit seek out a trio of playing cards that will lead them to hidden treasure through various clues and red herrings . Fun but average Western about two contenders who confront to steal three cards ; both of whom carry out strong confrontations to rob a treasure . Passable Spaghetti Western concerning about a greedy mouse-and cat game to take valuable cards in which there are inscriptions to locate the hidden treasure of General Santa Ana who previously defeated the Texans in ¨El Alamo¨ but he was subsequently vanquished by Sam Houston in battle of ¨San Jacinto¨ . As a few people are on the search of three cards with words that show where a Mexican treasure is buried . The mysterious drifter Billy Blood (Anthony Ghidra) is captured by General Munguya (as Robert Hundar) but he breaks out and uses a machine gun , doing a massacre against the cohorts .

As duo protagonists take on themselves , crossfire , fist-fight , to attempt to find the Mexican Army treasure . This movie is a bawdy , plenty of action Western , about ambition and greed , a dark and sinister subject one might expect from a typical Spaghetti , being more a story of ambitious people than about avenger gunslingers seeking revenge . The story is one of those in which everyone double crosses one another in the search for gold , as a great number of betrayals while hunting the fabulous treasure . It is typical , so-so film , but acceptable . There is a twist at the end , but I saw it coming about 10 minutes into the movie.

It is a serviceable as well as misogynist Spaghetti which doesn't take itself too seriously . This regular spaghetti packs thrills , brawls , shoot'em up , go riding throughout the inappropriate landscapes posing as Far West and results to be quite violent . There are pursuits , attacks , crossfire , fights , heinous cutthroats , and many others things . The acting seems about average for a Eurowestern . It stars a tough and quite gunslinger played in stoicism style by Dragomir Bojanic-Gidra , who was born in Servia Yugoslavia , he emigrated to Italy and developed a brief career , mostly Pasta Western as \"May God Forgive You... But I Won't\" , \"Ballata Per Un Pistolero\" or ¨Pistoleros¨, \"And Then a Time for Killing\" or ¨Tequila Joe¨, and \"Django the Last Killer\" . His nemesis results to be Robert Hundar who steals the show by doing the best acting out of the entire cast , as a villainous killer who relentlessly kills men and women , as well as torturing contenders by means of brutal tortures and even drowning cruelly a girl . At the beginning his career , Robert Hundar acted as an extra but Italian westerns soon followed in minor roles . He once reportedly missed out on a role in a Franco Nero western because his height made Franco Nero look too short , he soon moved into other film genres playing good guys , bad guys , and good-bad guys .

Takachiho Haruka created Crusher Joe after Star Wars became such a huge hit around the world.  Going back to old stories he had written in high school, he was able to pull together what would eventually become this movie.  Combining action, suspense, sci-fi, and a bit of romance, Crusher Joe pleases on many different levels.", "Some call these kinds of movies `Space Operas' and I suppose the title fits well.  Many ideas and techniques created in this anime, would be later used in more well known releases.  The story centers on a group of `Crushers' a group of space mercenaries, who make up one of four major groups.  You have the Crushers, who charge very high amounts of money to do odd jobs that require their near illegal, and often wild techniques.  You have Pirates who are out to take what they want at any cost.  The third group is the military known as the `United Space Force' which policies the galaxy of all wrong doing, especially Pirate activities.  The fourth group comprises varies governments and organizations necessary in any civilized world, or universe.", "The main character, a Crusher by the name of Joe, leads a team of 4 and one robot, who seems to be only present to remind people of the droids from Star Wars, into a situation that results in them loosing their Crusher's license. In an attempt to redeem themselves, they must infiltrate Pirate activity, and in the process uncover conspiracies that could eventual lead to the destruction of all life, everywhere.", "Crusher Joe is extremely well animated for a movie from 1983.  Much of the quick chase and actions scenes have fluid and well done motion.  Violence falls in the PG category only because it is animated, and would be closer to PG-13 if live action.  Hardly a moment goes by when some gun is not being fired, or a fight/chase explodes on screen.  Still, even with so much action the movie manages to win you over with the well developed and very intrusting story, and strong voice work by the actors.  While none of the characters are fleshed out to a great extent, there are many moments when you can see something much deeper then you would find in even the best live action movies.", "I highly recommend Crusher Joe.  If you can find it to buy,  jump on it quickly.  If you have any interest in anime, or sci-fi action movies, this will please you on many levels."]},

The team returned in two 1989 hour-long OAV (original animated video) episodes, \"The Ice Prison\" and \"The Ultimate Weapon: ASH.\" Both are available in the U.S., along with the movie, as part of a 2-disc DVD set released by AnimEigo.", "While the movie was long enough (130 min.) to allow us to spend time with the characters and follow their often humorous interactions and offered a sprawling story with endless twists and turns that went all over the galaxy, the OAVs are concentrated more on narrowly focused plots which tend to take place in one locale and deal with confrontations putting our heroes in tense life-or-death situations. They're well-written, offer excitement and genuine suspense and are marked by high quality animation and design that's as good as any theatrical space anime we've seen.", "\"The Ice Prison\" starts out on a planet run by an autocrat ruler who sends dissidents to an orbiting icy asteroid used as a penal colony which is then knocked out of orbit by a laser \"accident\" and threatens to plunge to the planet's surface. Crusher Joe and his team are called in to set things right but soon find they've been set up in a power play by the corrupt regime. \"The Ultimate Weapon\" finds a female army officer, Major Tanya, who is cuffed to a case containing a life-destroying new secret weapon, held hostage on a deserted planet by renegade officers seeking to undermine a peace process set to end an ongoing conflict between two warring systems. The Crushers are assigned to rescue Major Tanya and destroy the weapon. On the planet, not only do they have to fight the military but a hidden menace as well. Thousands of \"Cloakers\" appear-basketball-sized killing machines left over from an abandoned research project, which are self-replicating and target any and all humans.", "The first episode mixes a compelling sci-fi premise-how to stop an asteroid from hitting a planet-with conspiracy-type political intrigue and climaxes with rousing space combat that's as good as anything of its type seen in, say, the Gundam and Macross animated space series. The second episode is virtually nonstop action and suspense and is just so masterfully done that one wonders in frustration why no more Crusher Joe stories were ever animated and why there's been so little fan praise of these films, which rank with the best of anime space opera. Crusher Joe himself is a worthy successor to the whole Flash Gordon/Buck Rogers tradition of space-hopping pulp heroes, but with significant differences. He's younger, more quick-tempered, a bit more arrogant and money-hungry and notably reluctant to engage in noble heroics for their own sake (although he always does). In short, he's more human.", "The production crew includes character designer Yoshikazu Yasuhiko (who directed the Crusher Joe movie, as well as ARION and VENUS WARS), mecha designer Shoji Kawamori (\"Macross Plus\") and composer Keiichi Oku, whose sweeping, full-bodied orchestral themes might recall the work of John Williams."]},

Now if the film only focused on the love triangle and developed this properly, 'Dahleez' could have been way better but alas. Moreover it's got too many songs. Some are beautiful, others are okay and a few are truly abysmal. Jackie Shroff, Raj Babbar and Meenakshi Sheshadri are very good.

They'll miss out on several essential plot points, and this installment loses all of it's punch and point when viewed out of the grand scope of the whole Gall Force shebang (so it's a bit odd that Manga Video released the Earth videos here as a standalone title to an audience that had never previously heard of Gall Force and can't really appreciate this).", "To re-cap it very briefly, the first Gall Force trilogy tells the story of a never-ending war in space between two advanced races; the Solnoids and the Paranoids. The elites of the two races are aware that their ongoing war has already sent both races on their way to inevitable mutual wiping out, so they started a project to create a new, Solnoid/Paranoid hybrid race, which would hopefully have a bit more common sense. This eventually led to the birth of the human race. While it was too late to save the Solnoids and Paranoids from killing off each other altogether, the humans got the chance to start over on earth and hopefully not make the same mistakes as their ancestors. Only, by the time of the Earth Chapter episodes, mankind has hit choppy waters. Using a last scrap of Solnoid/Paranoid technology found on the moon, they've built legions of cyborgs called the MME. These MME then went a bit Terminator and have turned the whole earth into a ravaged wasteland. Most of mankind has fled to Mars, and only a handful of fighters remain on earth, struggling against the MME.", "What basically happens in the Earth Chapter tapes is that mankind makes a few collective attempts at wiping out the MME, only to change their mind at the last moment when they realise that they'll do more harm than good to themselves by running in, guns blazing. In the first episode, it's nuclear missiles that will irrevocably destroy the earth's ecosystem while they wouldn't even scratch the MME, all while a small sect believes they've found a way to restore earth's ecology someday. The second episode features a huge space-based plasma cannon sent from Mars to blow up the MME HQ from space...but the blast is so powerful it'll also destroy the entire earth along with it. The MME base is finally taken out in the third tape through less radical means, and mankind may hopefully have picked up some of the message that the Solnoids and Paranoids, and also these tapes try to convey; that blind aggression never leads to anything.", "Trouble is, while the story is interesting enough at points and has some strong sentimental moments, it's all done pretty poorly. Animation quality is very lacklustre, for one thing. Between the frequent re-cycling of animation sequences and the hilarious jerky walks of the MME in the first tape, we're not exactly being treated to a visual feast.", "The plots also suffer from being too hurried to pack the punch they could. The way they heavily borrow elements from previous Gall Force films and a myriad of other sci-fi greats also drags them down to more predictable and sedate levels. Even the whole pacifist message doesn't come across as powerfully as it could because of this. Same to the leitmotiv that mankind has itself to blame for the pretty stupid self-destruction they've set in motion. If even strong themes like this can't make the tapes really interesting, something has to be a bit wrong with them. It's unfortunately all too obvious that you're watching low-quality stuff for a viewer to be impressed by the few good things there still are in here. The staggeringly poor English dub doesn't help matters either, leading to lots of crummy dialogue and bad acting (Fortine is cursed with an especially ridiculous voice).", "Some punches in favor of the Earth Chapter tapes, all the same; it does have atmosphere, with the nicely painted backgrounds getting the feel of a destroyed earth across very well. The acres of ruined skyscrapers are especially dramatic to behold. The music was really rather nice as well, with some themes that stick in your head for a while and back up the action scenes very well. However, even with this, the Earth Chapters can only be recommended to those who know the previous Gall Forces well, and really liked what they saw there. There's very little point in watching this otherwise."]},

Ran is unlike any hero I have seen in the anime genre because he doesn't fit the stereotype of the conquering hero.  \"Green Legend\" runs long at over two hours but it should not take away from viewing such a masterful heroic story.

Ms MacLaine is a dynamically talented performer who has paid her dues over and over; I just wish that she didn't have a penchant for making ludicrous public statements about religion, reincarnation and politics.", "'Gypsy in My Soul' is this special's title, and in this case 'Gypsy' refers not to Romanies but to the Broadway 'gypsies', the chorus dancers who go from one musical to the next, seldom attaining stardom yet usually displaying far more dancing talent than the stars whom they support. (Shirley MacLaine, who began as a chorus dancer, is also the only Broadway star who has been privileged to wear the 'gypsy robe', traditionally given to the most experienced chorus dancer in a Broadway musical.)", "The opening number here is the title song, which Shirley performs with panache, energy and some dazzling high kicks ... which become literally dazzling when she's joined by Laservision. This gimmick doesn't quite work here; basically, a row of parallel lines -- each one a different colour -- are laser-beamed into midair alongside Shirley, and the lines interact as if they're dancing with her. Unfortunately, the bright red line -- the one with the most conspicuous colour -- is slightly out of focus, so it looks fuzzier than the others. I did like the finale of the number, in which Shirley pretends to kick each laser beam out of her way.", "Later in this special, Shirley dances with Les Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo, a bunch of drag queens who are also talented ballet dancers, their gimmick being that they dance (mostly) female roles en-pointe. (For the pas de deux, one of them will temporarily don male costume.) I can enjoy drag humour, but I just don't get the point of the 'Trocks'. I don't find them funny, and indeed (to their credit) they don't seem to be trying to PARODY ballet. They seem to be performing it fairly earnestly, using male bodies to inhabit roles traditionally played by female dancers. Still, I don't see the point. I'd lot rather see some graceful ballerinas doing these roles, rather than some transvestites. The male body's centre of gravity being much higher than the female's, there's simply no way that these men can handle pointe roles with female proficiency. The Trocks aren't quite good enough to be a straightforward ballet turn, and their material isn't kinky enough to appeal to anyone expecting to see a conventional drag act.", "At the end of the special, along comes Lucille Ball, wearing a riding habit that she seems to have borrowed from the fox hunt in 'Mame'. Lucy offers some memories of her days as a struggling actress in New York, including her method of cadging free coffee and free meals at theatre restaurants. I'm no fan of Lucille Ball, and I don't see much point to her presence here. It's true that Ball, like MacLaine, started at the bottom and eventually reached stardom through hard work, but Ball's struggling years as a Broadway wanna-be -- unlike MacLaine's -- led absolutely nowhere, and Ball became a star only after quitting New York for Hollywood, playing dozens of bit roles in obscure films (and dancing in Sam Goldwyn's chorus line) while she gradually learnt her craft.", "Refreshingly, Lucille Ball is quite self-deprecating here ... or at least she pretends to be. When she makes her entrance, she pretends to stumble. Later, she confides to MacLaine that she HAD to become a star, because she couldn't sing, couldn't dance and couldn't act. (I'll agree with her on that part.) This entire special is well-staged and enjoyable, the Trockaderos supplying the only longueurs. I'll rate this show 7 out of 10."]},

There are some cool shots of the characters zipping around Paris in a funny little Eurocar. And then there's the nightclub, with some cool late 50s jazz and the associated dancing.  I liked that.  At times it felt like a low-rent Fellini film, La Dolce Vita-era.  And then there are the several stripteases.  The stripteases aren't overly explicit, but they're nice.  There's an innocence to them.  It's about the art of striptease; it doesn't feel exploitative. Some of the scenes are quite creatively choreographed, although not particularly creatively filmed.  The camera just kind of stands and stares. But I guess if you've got something inherently beautiful and interesting on screen, there's no reason to overcomplicate it.", "Unfortunately, the rest of the movie insists on having a plot, and not a very interesting one.

All the male voices sounded like they'd been tape recorded and then played back at 2/3 speed. Everyone sounded like James Earl Jones.  And some of the female voices sounded exactly like Monty Pythonesque female impersonations.  I wonder what my neighbors were thinking; they must have been able to hear this through the wall."]},

Paradoxically, \"Cinema Marginal\" -- the opposite of mainstream cinema -- was in fact massively influenced by pop culture (comic strips, pop art, Brazilian popular music especially the Tropicália movement, junk-TV, the Chanchadas, the Cangaço movies, and trash Hollywood and Mexican movies). In other words, metalinguistic cinema with iconoclast spirit, \"pop flavor\" and sarcastic sense of humor that combined wit, mockery and kitsch.", "As often happens with experimental movies, \"Matou a Família...\" is irregular -- it's alternately interesting and boring, intelligent and silly, impacting and frustrating. But it's a landmark of cinematic artistic independence in Brazil and, 35 years later, still has definite assets: the initial murder sequence; the structural rupture of the \"film within the film\"; the anarchic spirit that pervades the movie; the beautiful female stars (Márcia Rodrigues, 20, fresh from her star-turn as the \"Girl from Ipanema\" from Leon Hirszman's 1967 movie, and talented Renata Sorrah, 21, already impressive in her 2nd film); fine support from veteran Rodolfo Arena (who, in 60 seconds and practically with his voice alone, builds a complete character as the murdered father) and Vanda Lacerda (as Sorrah's shrewish mother); VERY bold scenes depicting police torture (remember this was filmed during the black years of Brazilian military regime) and the daring lubric scenes between Rodrigues and Sorrah, in a time when even the mention of the \"L-word\" was frowned upon. And, as usual with Bressane, his choice of soundtrack is fabulous -- great songs performed by Roberto Carlos, Mário Reis, Francisco Alves, Carmen Miranda and Ray Charles. But fragmentation takes its toll, and it's inevitable that the good parts are better than the whole.", "Do watch this if you're into unconventional film-making or if you want to know more about Júlio Bressane's very personal style and Brazilian \"Cinema Marginal\" movement. Don't watch it if you're allergic to experimentalism and non-sequitur story-telling.

A pioneer of quality production in France and in the USA, he met with tremendous success, both artistic and public, with his 1922 adaptation of 'The Three Musketeers'. But with the advent of sound he gradually became a name among others, only occasionally rising (slightly) above a run-of-the-mill level ('La Maternelle', 'Monsieur Fabre'). He reached his nadir during the 1950s, when he appeared desperately out of sync with his times. Who on earth indeed remembers his outdated 'Mon Curé' comedies? Or even worse, his pathetic tribute to radio and TV bland presenter Jean Nohain titled 'C'est arrivé à 36 Chandelles'? So when the 63-year-old producer-director announced his intention to can a new version of Georges Courteline's hilarious novel 'Messieurs-les-Ronds-de-Cuir' (The Bureaucrats), one had a right to be skeptical. But what was to be Diamant-Berger's last directorial effort (he would go on producing until the late 1960s) finally came as a refreshing surprise. Seeing the finished film proved one thing, Courteline had not only inspired the veteran filmmaker but given him a new lease of life, artistically speaking at least.\nThere is no denying indeed that this 1958 version comes close to equaling Yves Mirande's 1936 hilarious one, not to say equals it. Do the test: see both and you will certainly conclude that each of the two adaptations works fine. What brings them together is certainly an equivalent mix of caustic wit, unbridled nonsensical humor and top rate comedy actors, three well-proportioned ingredients that make one and the other converge to the best.\nLet's take these ingredients one by one. Satire, in the first place, bites home with the same sharpness in Diamant-Berger's version as in Mirande's, courtesy of Courteline who knew what perfectly well what he was talking about. Having indeed been a civil servant himself (as little hard-working as his hero Lahrier by his own admission!) - and for fourteen years -, the writer had had every opportunity to observe the closed world of French administration. Targeting its shortcomings and abuses was not only easy for him but also paved the way to success insofar as the general public enjoys seeing bashed those who all too often plague their lives when having to deal with them. What makes Diamant-Berger's adaptation all the more palatable (as was also the case with Mirande's) is that Courteline's text and characters are respected, which as well meets the expectations of those who know the text as delights those who discover it. Last but not least, the cast. If the 1936 picture could boast a gathering of giants of the thirties (Saturnin Fabre, Jean Tissier, Arletty, Pierre Larquey), the new one does not lag behind, bringing together talented comedians of the new generation (Jean Poiret, Michel Serrault, Jean Richard, Micheline Dax, Philippe Clay, Jeanne Sourza) and actors who were already stars in the 1930s (Noël-Noël, Pierre Brasseur) including one, Lucien Baroux, who appeared in the first version (Lucien Baroux, Lahrier in 1936 and Soupe - the former's pet aversion - 22 years later) . Who can beat that?\nAmong all those excellent actors, I would like to highlight the brilliant performance of singer Philippe Clay, also an excellent but very underrated actor (Casimir le Serpentin in Renoir's 'French Cancan', Clopin Trouillefou in Delannoy's 'Notre-Dame de Paris', and many other singular roles) Bony-faced, all skin and bones, with incredible goggling eyes, he was the ideal person to play Letondu, the demented public officer who jumps, shouts, laughs hysterically and plays the trumpet inconsiderately. Clay is both very funny and very scary: nobody else could have been a better Letondu!\nOne could argue that Diamant-Berger's direction is just serviceable, which is rather true but as he serves a great text after gathering a somewhat ideal cast what is there to complain about ? Moreover, if you look at the film without blinders, you will notice some (timid but real) camera or editing work off the beaten track.\nAll in all, the 1958 version of \"Messieurs-les-Ronds-de-Cuir\" may be less legendary than the 1936 one, it is however quite worth watching. Even the modern ending stands on its own merits. The introduction of computers in French administration was still science fiction in the 1950s. Diamant-Berger's film therefore has all the more merit for its right anticipation of two realities yet to come: on the one hand, computers would some day be used by civil servants and, on the other hand, that... would not change anything. And it is a fact that nowadays, and in spite of the serious work of a great part of public officers, the same sins still affect French administration : mismanagement, incompetence, disrespect of the public and other free rides. Had Courteline still been alive, he could very well have written the 1958 film's coda along similar lines.\nWell, one thing is clear: if you do not know this adaptation of Courteline's masterful farce, do not hesitate to view it. René Chateau, who kindly thinks of you distributes it on DVD."]},

Well, it's something that had been continuing since ages. Now polygamy has been declared illegal (especially for the Hindus) in India and practically also, whether rich or poor, the men do not find themselves as capable of affording more than one wife. Still, it is a common assumption that men cannot be satisfied by being devoted to only one woman and even when they cannot marry one additional woman, at least they go for flirting. Being licentious is considered something very bad, however being flirt has a relatively mild connotation. I have heard in lighter vein that everybody (man) finds the wife of the other person better than his own. However, the phenomena of extra-marital affairs of men with unmarried girls, is something pretty common in today's society.", "Without going into the intricacies of the issue as to how and why extra-marital affairs evolve, let me review a brilliant comedy of the seventies made on this theme only which tells the story of a man who had entered into love-marriage with his wife but after a few years of marriage, gets ready every time to fall into an affair with one girl or the other (she must be beautiful though). This memorable comedy is Pati, Patni Aur Woh (1978). Legendary director B.R. Chopra had made this movie which is a highly entertaining one and presents the husband-wife-other woman triangle (i.e., Pati, Patni Aur Woh) in lighter vein, generating a treasure of laughs for the audience.", "The hero is my favourite actor - Sanjeev Kumar who plays Ranjeet and the heroine is the girl next door heroine of the seventies - Vidya Sinha who plays his wife - Shaarada. Ranjeet and Shaarada had entered into the life-long relationship through love-marriage and now they have a lovely kid also (played by the child artist - Master Bittoo). Ranjeeta forms the third angle of this triangle in the form of Ranjeet's beautiful and unmarried secretary - Nirmala.", "The story starts with the animation pictures of the Adam and Eve story as to how they fell from the paradise and settled on the Earth. Adam, i.e., Ranjeet is happy with his original Eve, i.e., Shaarada and the family life including their son also. However he is not able to resist the temptation of having an affair with the beautiful secretary joining his office, i.e., Nirmala. He tells her a lot of lies regarding his 'sad' family life and successfully woos her by gaining her heartfelt sympathies for him. As usual, no wife can ever be ignorant of her husband's affair and Shaarada also comes to know it. When Nirmala gets aware of the lies spoken to her by Ranjeet, she leaves the job in a heartbroken state. Shaarada hopes that now Ranjeet won't repeat this but as they say, old habits die hard.", "A married man's being licentious (or flirting if we present it the milder way) is a serious issue for the society and before that, the family which is the founding unit of any society. The learned director and the writer (who is none other than the famous Hindi literativist, Kamleshwar) conclude that the men are essentially flirts (if not all, at least a majority of them) and their women cannot stop them from flirting because it's their basic instinct. Even when a man is devoted to his wife and feels responsible towards his family, he cannot escape the temptation of flirting an attractive girl (upon getting a chance). However the writer-director duo has not made a serious movie, it has made a hilarious comedy.", "Right from the pre-marriage encounter of Ranjeet and Shaarada to the ending scene of the movie (post the end of Ranjeet-Nirmala affair), the film is a laugh-riot. Even where it does not generate loud laughs, it generates tickles. The Adam-Eve story provides a highly interesting start to the movie and thereafter it never digresses from its principal (and the only) objective of making the audience laugh. The script, the direction and the dialogues, all are topnotch.", "Sanjeev Kumar, Vidya Sinha, Master Bittoo and Asrani (Ranjeet's friend) have left no stone unturned in creating laughter for the viewers. Ranjeeta has got a profound role but it's the profoundness of that role only which is the premise of this comedy. She has been a good actress (though underrated) and she has done well.", "Technically the movie is good. According to the middle-class set-up of the story, the movie has been given a simple look. It's a low budget movie but made and presented in an aesthetic way.", "Ravindra Jain's music is equally hilarious as the movie is. Thande Thande Paani Se Nahaana Chaahiye and Ladki Cycle Waali create a lot of laughs when heard and watched on the screen. Na Aaj Tha Na Kal Tha and Tere Naam Tere Naam Tere Naam are also good in quality.", "Well, though it's a comedy, it leaves a serious question in the end. The hero has been shown to be devoted to his wife and son, fulfilling all his responsibilities towards them and sharing all the joys with them too. Nowhere is there any dissatisfaction for him from his marital life. Then why at all, should such a person go for wooing a girl outside his marriage and enter into an affair ? The question put up by me in the title of this review comes to fore again. Can't the men avoid flirting despite being happy in their homes ? Or is infidelity something quite pleasure-rendering for the males ? The question is ticklish."]},

The animation itself is also very good.\nI think everyone who likes postapocalyptical settings will more or less like this movie although it's plot could have been structured in a more interesting way. The English dubbing was as usual for Animes of that decade rather bad.\nWatch it if you like the Fallout games or simply like 80s Animes better than Animes that run nowadays."]},

One of the purposes of the award is to generate income for AFI from the broadcasting rights to a televised edition of the AFI tribute ... so, the award is always given to someone whose name value is likely to generate high TV ratings. The first three recipients were John Ford, James Cagney and Orson Welles. Wyler seems an odd choice to be the next year's guest of honour (after Welles) because most filmgoers and TV audiences had never heard of him. Wyler's name on a movie simply doesn't embody a mystique in the way that 'a Hitchcock film' or 'a Capra film' or even 'a Preston Sturges film' does. (Hitchcock and Capra were later recipients of the AFI honour.)", "In fact, William Wyler has directed more Oscar-winning performances than any other director, by a comfortable margin ... a record which is unlikely ever to be broken, now that the Hollywood studio system has ended. Wyler was beloved and respected within the industry, and his films were (and are) well-known and beloved by movie audiences, even if the average movie fan of today has no idea who he was.", "As usual for the AFI tributes, this evening alternates between film clips from the work of the guest of honour, and testimonials by Hollywood celebrities whose name value will bring in some TV ratings. James Stewart gets a look-in, speaking about Wyler's career in general rather than about the one obscure movie which Stewart and Wyler made together ('Thunderbolt', a wartime propaganda film). Gregory Peck and Audrey Hepburn both give tributes to Wyler, and we see a clip from 'Roman Holiday': the scene in the church of Santa Maria in Cosmedin, where Peck frightens Hepburn by pretending that La Bocca della Verità ('the Mouth of Truth') has bitten off his hand. This scene is a surprising choice to be shown out of context, especially for viewers who have never seen 'Roman Holiday' in its entirety: we have no advance notice that this movie is a romance or a comedy, so -- when Peck pretends that his hand has been bitten off -- the action is much more startling here than it is in the actual movie.", "Talking of missing hands: the most moving testimonial of the night comes from Harold Russell, the only actor ever to win two Oscars for the same role. During the second World War, Russell was an Army sergeant whose hands were blown off whilst he was deactivating a dynamite charge. Wyler cast him in 'The Best Years of Our Lives' as the homecoming sailor who has lost both hands in action. Russell, with his prosthetic hooks gleaming in the spotlight, gives a heartfelt tribute to Wyler ... then adds some humour with a personal anecdote about an encounter with a woman who noticed that Russell resembled the hook-handed actor in this movie, and (failing to realise who he was) she suggested that he should watch the film as inspiration to overcome his own handicap!", "Each AFI tribute ends with the guest of honour mounting the podium and saying a few words. I've observed that William Wyler's name doesn't carry the mystique that so many other directors' names do. One reason for this may well be that Wyler (unlike Hitchcock, Capra, Ford, Welles, Preminger, Truffaut and so many others) was a genuinely modest and self-effacing man. When Wyler was signed to direct the 1959 remake of 'Ben-Hur', MGM's publicity department blared that Wyler had been an assistant director on the 1925 silent version ... until Wyler modestly pointed out that his duties on that earlier film (with 'assistant director' as his official title) had merely been crowd control.", "Wyler continues that modesty here. He tells the story of how he broke into the film business: with no previous movie experience, he walked into the office of Carl Laemmle (head of production at Universal) and demanded a prestigious job. Laemmle was so impressed with this young man (claims Wyler) that he was hired straight away as a director. The punchline has Wyler saying: 'Thank you, Uncle Carl'.", "Laemmle was notorious for padding the payroll of Universal Studios with his relations and in-laws, to the extent that he was nicknamed 'Uncle Carl' ... leading Ogden Nash to compose his couplet:", "\"Uncle Carl Laemmle had a very large faemmle.\"", "In Wyler's case, that nepotism turned out to be a good thing. William Wyler has made many wonderful films, and his AFI award is well-deserved. 10 out of 10!"]},

As I understand it, this footage, which Eisenstein was compelled to abandon, has been compiled and edited into a sort of travelogue by the Oleg Kovalov, who gets director credit for this film.  This is a travelogue in a more old-fashioned sense  not a survey of resorts, hotels, casinos and airports, but an impression of the time, place, people and atmosphere of old Mexico.  It has been edited per notes left by Eisenstein, along with a degree of interpretation guided by Kovalov's knowledge of Eisenstein's style and intentions.  However far it might have strayed from those original intentions, it is a remarkably beautiful film in its own right.", "Early on in the film, the compositions look like Gaugin paintings come to life, as the provincial Mexicans strike the iconic poses that Eisenstein set up, surrounded by tropical foliage.  In one particular shot, two young woman hold their pose under some palm leaves, but the one on the left repeatedly breaks into giggles, possibly over the strange attitude that the crazy Russian has asked her to hold.  Really charming.  Many of the scenes with the local people are moody, or even a bit spooky, some involving symbols of death.  Others are more festive, but still with a dark quality to them.  A Russian is a Russian, I guess.", "A stereo soundtrack has been added which consists of various ethnic music (not just Mexican), more modern, avant-garde music, and ambient sounds and sound effects that are so apt and well-timed to the film, they give you an eerie sense of being there.  This is one of the best things I've seen in a long time, and I can't recommend it highly enough."]},

Driven from his native town, he settled down, a miserable, unhappy weaver far from home, and let one passion, the love for gold, become the absorbing motive of his existence. In the town where he plied his trade lived Squire Cass, the father of two sons. One of them, Godfrey, by name, was a serious-purposed conscientious young man, on whom his father leaned for support. The other, Dunstan, the younger, was a spendthrift and a roisterer. As the elder son grew in favor with his father, and as his marriage to Nancy Lammeter, the daughter of a most respectable family, seemed imminent, Dunstan resolved that his brother should be forced to fall from grace. Thereupon he succeeded in getting his elder brother under the influence of rum, as they were on a journey through the country, and while Godfrey was in this condition, Dunstan inveigled him into marrying a pretty barmaid. When he returned to sobriety, Godfrey was horrified at what he had done. He provided for his wife, and returned to his home. But Dunstan used this knowledge to force money from his brother's share. At length, the younger brother's rioting used up what money Godfrey could easily give him. Godfrey was forced to ask for time. As Dunstan returned from hunting one night, he stopped in Silas Marner's cabin as shelter from the rain. He discovered the miser's hidden gold, and taking it in his hands, ran from the house. In the darkness and the rain, he did not see an old well nearby. He fell into it as he ran, and was drowned. Silas, on returning home, was nearly crazed at the loss of the only thing he loved in the world. Squire Cass and Godfrey, hearing nothing from Dunstan, believed that he had wearied of his restricted life, and thought that he had run away from home. And so Godfrey married Nancy, and the following New Year's Eve the Squire gave a ball. That same night, Molly, Godfrey's barmaid wife, decided that she would confront the squire's son with their child. But as she reached the road near Silas Marner's hut, she became exhausted from her journey through the snow, and fell by the way. Eppie, the child, ran to the light shining from Marner's window, entering the house, and fell asleep by the fire. The weaver was also asleep, and when he awoke and saw the child's golden hair shining in the fire light, he thought it was his gold come back to him. He reached for it and picked it up in his hands, to find that it was the curly locks of the child. The mother's voice was heard calling, but when Silas reached her, she was unconscious. She later died. Godfrey, recognizing his barmaid wife in the dead woman, knew that Eppie was his own child. But he did not confess to Nancy, not until years had passed and life had granted them a childless fireside. Then the Squire's eldest son told his wife the tale. Together they went to Marner's hut and begged Eppie to come with them. But she remained true to the old weaver who had grown to love her more than life itself. When the old well was drained, the remains of Dunstan were found, the money box clutched in his hands."]},

You will love the anti-hero tex Murphy, who doesn't take himself seriously, but still gets you involved in great told stories and solves them also. The overseer has some great dramatic scenes, which I do not see often in computer games. The humour in this Tex Murphy is as great as ever. You just have to see it, and when you do I know you will get hooked. It isn't that easy to get from one scene to the next one, there are a lot of puzzles to be solved, but when needed hints are provided, so it really makes you believe you are solving mysteries. So when people say the plot isn't that special, I can confirm that. But people forget that the experience on a computer is very different from watching a movie on the television. Even a b-movie type plot can be enjoyed as a oscar winning plot on the computer.  \"Overseer\" delivers a great gaming experience with a very sympathetic Michael York. The graphics are beautiful. And if this adventure is being typecasted as a b-movie,so be it but \"Overseer\" (as the whole experience) is even better then most A-movies. Go play it!"]},

It is not as big a landmark as the 1971 incarnation, which was always superbly written, entertaining and even suspenseful, actually really admired the darker and grittier tone of the earlier episodes, which more than made up for the ill-fitting and out-of-date music.

Do have to agree that a lot of the modern day jokes in the American/English dub are really jarring and anachronistic, and whether they're successful in being funny wildly varies (some are entertaining, others pretty cringe-worthy and distract badly). Things can be wildly implausible in the earlier episodes, with action that is admittedly well-animated and exciting but throws logic out the window.", "However, as said, the animation is more polished this time round. There is more refinement in the drawings, more vibrant colouring, bolder and more meticulous background details and it looks more imaginative in general. The music score, again as aforementioned, is a much better fit and is more dynamically scored with a real liveliness, cool vibe and lushness.", "Writing is incredibly funny, very smart and also very intelligent, while the action even with the implausibility is really exciting and often beautifully and imaginatively animated.

The long-running radio series, usually starring Peter Coke as Paul and the incomparable Marjorie Westbury as his wife Steve, was a brilliantly manufactured set of whodunnits over as many as 8 episodes, where the plot twisted and turned and corpses piled up. Paul and Steve were perfectly at home in a (vanishing) world of martinis and Soho clubs, and weekends away at Maidenhead. Great play was made of Paul and Steve's domestic arrangements - we would hear them discussing the case over breakfast, passing the marmalade while theorising, and much was made of Steve's shopping trips. This trademark Durbridge vibe was often transferred to television, for example in Melissa or The Doll.", "This TV series - whose production, incidentally, was the direct cause of the cancellation of the radio show - takes Paul and Steve out of that world, into the world of colour supplement 70s glamour. The whodunnit element is played down, and the 50 minute format makes devious plot twists impossible. The end result is more Alistair MacLean than Francis Durbridge (Durbridge had no input into the scripts).", "The ever-reliable Francis Matthews makes a decent stab at Paul, but Steve is turned into a typical dolly bird of the time, clearly 15-20 years younger. This was miscasting of epic proportions - the radio Steve was at least as mature as Paul, and impossibly glamorous (think Audrey Hepburn, or Myrna Loy in the Thin Man films). The relationship worked as one of equals, rather than here where the whiff of sugar daddy is amplified by the fact that Steve gets little to say and less to do, other than marvel at Paul's genius. Poor Ms Drinkwater was somewhat out of her depth, as can be seen by a scan of her previous career, and, at least according to imdb, after this failure never worked in the business again (she moved into photojournalism).", "This of course might have worked, despite the failure to transfer the Temples' characters to television, had the programmes been any good. But they weren't. Meagre plotting, dull characters, and (later on), incomprehensible accents from foreign actors managed to make most episodes fall flat. Paul Temple was a major brand for the BBC, and they made a lot of efforts to keep the series going, but it thrived in a different world, and the attempt to give it a 1970s update bombed, and to my knowledge Paul Temple never appeared again in a new English-language production set in the present day; the BBC did produce new versions of missing radio serials in 2006, but these were based on original scripts, using the original scores and sound effects, and set in the 1950s.", "Paul Temple wasn't murdered, but his disappearance was down to manslaughter, and this series was largely responsible."]},

And, as of now, like it happened with other series popular in the same span of years in the same place (I'm talking in particular about Tsurikichi Sanpei), it has aged awfully in its original, fansubbed form that I've recently watched because of the presence of a Seiyuu I'm a fan of in the cast (Rika Fukami), meaning that what this series amounts is nothing more than a badly done clone of the third and fourth seasons of Rupan Sansei Part II, which I guess were extremely popular when this was made but of which I'm not a particular fan of barring some acceptably written/interesting episodes like the one with the gang of Rupan Sansei running away from Moscow where Fujiko Mine steals the show. And not only it's a badly done clone but, worst of all, it's a boring ASF clone with cheap copies of the most beloved Rupan Sansei characters minus what made them interesting or relevant in the first place (in particular, the cloned Fujiko Mine by the name of Saeko is simply ridicolous in comparison to the original Rupan Sansei eternal, worship-worthy love Goddess and master thief) and storylines repeated over and over and over with the hope that the music and the sex stuff - once again, like Kimagure Orange Road, removed from the equation thanks to the kiddifying censorships in the west. Again, how this series ever survived in the first place?! - alone would have made up for the complete lack of ideas from the production team, which it didn't. Boring, unfunny on the longer run, with a mediocre chara where almost all the men for some reason look like the protagonist, how this spawned three seasons total and one spinoff (Angel's Heart) when already at the incredible amount of twenty episodes this whole IP had already lost all its reasons to be is completely beyond me. As a person who had fond memories of this, I can't recommend enough to avoid it with no remorse whatsoever, even if you're a fan of the Seiyuu cast involved."]},

The 2011 adaptation was too short and had a very rushed final episode but was very enjoyable on the most part, while the 1938 film was heavily flawed being too short, feeling a bit too jumpy narratively, having an underwritten Joe and the latter half being caked in over-sentimentality but it was very evocatively made and was well directed and acted. The best of the three versions though is this 1974 series, the only one close to perfect. Don't let the length and pacing deter you, South Riding- a literary masterpiece and a great operation recovery remedy- is a big book, a long one with a lot going on. Like I said with a number of Charles Dickens and George Eliot adaptations(The Woman in White too), the slow deliberate pacing was necessary as was the long but not overlong length, otherwise it would have been rushed and incoherent. The first episode also admittedly is heavy-going with you being told and shown a lot, but stick with it because the series gets even more engrossing. The series looks elegant and true to period, the Yorkshire sights and sounds also beautifully evoked, and it is photographed with care. There will be those who find it dated by today's standards, not for me and if it was(emphasis on if) it was part of the charm. Ron Grainer's music is understated and appropriate to the mood, it doesn't have the memorable sweep of Richard Adinsell's score in the 1938 film but considering that this is a different medium, a mini-series rather than a film, that's hardly a detriment. ", "The dialogue is incredibly thought-provoking with room for heart-warming smiles and also tears, it also has the feeling of the prose of the book brought to life and the dialects and behaviours of the characters are loyally adapted too. The story didn't feel tedious or too stretched out, the many characters and subplots ensure there is a lot going on but because of the length and pace these have time to unfold properly and have time to breathe and expand. It's engrossing and moving story-telling, true in spirit and detail to the book(always helps but for adaptations complete fidelity isn't and shouldn't be considered an issue), and most importantly all the way through it's coherent. South Riding(1974) is skilfully directed and the acting helped by the very vividly written characterisations is fabulous. There's not, and probably won't ever be, a Mrs Beddows better than Hermione Baddeley, while Dorothy Tutin is firm yet sympathetic as Sarah and Nigel Davenport is a nuanced and brooding Robert Carne, the relationship between Sarah and Robert starts off very polar opposites with Robert representing a lot of what Sarah strongly dislikes but turns out very tender. John Cater gives his most affecting performance as Snaif, he is manipulative and untrustworthy initially yet very tormented and with his heart in the right place(the sort of character perhaps who makes bad decisions thinking they're not). Norman Jones is fine as Joe, sleazy, charming and touchingly dignified, extra brownie points given too for exploring in detail and vividly his background which the 2011 and 1938 versions did not do. In conclusion, brilliant mini-series and adaptation, for fans of the book this is the version to see. 10/10 Bethany Cox"]},

The pacing of a single sketch could sometimes resemble a slow buildup of a feature length film and would last an entire 30-minute episode, but was delivered to the viewers in just 30 second segments which progressed the story. In other sketches the pacing is blink-and-you-will-miss type of", "hectic bombardment forcing the viewers the stay on the edge of their seats for an entire episode. Sketches are interwoven, often running parallel to each other, introducing recurring characters and often having no decided meaning or punchline. They just... were there. And were extremely funny... just by being there.", "However delirious the humor in the sketches is, it is scripted in detail with virtually no improvisation allowed. The actors, especially Heiskanen, Petelius and Hukkanen are great performers in their own right, with excellent timing and sense of delivery, but by sticking to the scripts they make each show a coherent, intelligent entity. Some of the sketches were more topical 20 years ago, but most of the writing touches diverse subjects such as family values, relationships, work ethics, sports, the Finnish tradition and way of life. All of the above are really universal and will be preserved for generations to come, so chances are they will still make people laugh another 20 years down the line. Some of the sketches are just full of outrageous stream of consciousness and make little sense, but are executed with surgical precision and form. And that truly is rare in todays 'cheap laughs, easy thrills' society.", "As a 1983 novelty item, Velipuolikuu was also the first Finnish tv show where the blooper take could end up being the final take, so sometimes you may catch the actor completely losing it but valiantly proceeding to the end of the sketch. Instead of hiding this and doing another take, this was then turned around to be an advantage. When the actors were not able to restrain themselves, they decidedly made their outburst part of the sketch invoking just another laugh in the viewer.", "Deliberate foolishness usually stands the test of time well. But the attention to detail, all the way down to the set pieces, costumes and makeup, is astonishing and even 20 years later when everything looks horribly out of date, you can appreciate the effort invested in the production values.", "If you were not able to catch this masterpiece in its entirety 20 years ago (or weren't even born back then!) and managed to miss the recent reruns in Finnish television, there are no excuses left for you to not buy the 2-DVD set containing all 15 episodes.", "An eternal classic."]},

Which is a filthy  shame: Bagong Bayani is the best Filipino film since Orapronobis in the  late 1980's.  Instead of a career devoted to skin flicks, Aguiluz sharpened his teeth  on documentaries. He pours that not inconsiderable experience into this  film: parts of actual interviews mix deftly with dramatizations of  specific episodes; the outside and inside of Changi prison were filmed  with hidden cameras (Aguiluz reportedly dressed as a turbaned Indian to  film the prison gates; when a guard spotted him, he literally had to  run to save the film footage).  From the first frame onwards it's obvious that this is not going to be  your usual Carlos J. Caparas massacre flick. Flor Contemplacion (Helen  Gamboa) is led, bare-footed, to the gallows; she is followed by a  restless camera, seeking her out from every angle--hand-held, tilted,  low-angled, panning. The execution itself happens swiftly in a series  of shots so fluidly cut they have the smoothness and finality of a  hanged man's sperm emission.  The film shifts back to Flor's interrogation: she is forced to stand  for hours, deprived of food and water, while the CID officer (an  intensely convincing Pen Medina) strikes her. I was told that this was  the first time Helen Gamboa gave a real performance. If so, it was  worth the wait; Gamboa is riveting as she shows us the final stages of  exhaustion without resorting to the standard excess hysterics of  Filipino acting.  It's said that Chanda Romero wants to sue this film, because the part  of Flor was promised to her. But her performance as Delia Maga is no  disappointment. She's always been an extremely talented actress, and  her acting has never felt more honest and open than here. The scene  where she discovers her ward drowned is especially fine: having a good  idea as to what her employer might do to her, she picks up the phone  and literally has to force herself to call him; you can see the terror  in her trembling hands. But her best moments are spent with her fellow  actress. Romero and Gamboa establish an easy but close rapport; we  sense the loneliness that draws them together. The fact that their  employers allow them to see each other about once a week only  strengthens the tie.  Aguiluz underlines the enforced isolation by showing us Flor's room: a  tiny cubicle nearly filled up by a single cot, where a hi-tech TV set  that must have cost a month's wages has to sit on the room's one  folding chair. Flor, in being convicted, had only exchanged one prison  for another, a living death for a real death. One shot actually  illustrates this visually: as Flor climbs the apartment stairs to meet  Delia Maga for the last time, the camera follows her past darkened  corridors and bright windows as if she was fading in and out, her  existence uncertain.  One of the film's finest sequences takes place inside Changi prison,  where Flor meets Virginia Parumog. Their early scenes have a  deliciously tentative feel, as Virginia tries to draw Flor out of her  torture-and-drug-induced shell, and their friendship begins to firm. I  have rarely seen acting--Filipino acting--as delicately played as this.  As examples of female bonding, these short scenes (plus those between  Flor and Delia) put the more expensive and supposedly more talented  cast of Little Women to shame.  Irma Adlawan as Virginia gives an astonishing performance: warm,  intelligent, deeply compassionate. She senses Flor's enormous need, and  her strength and sympathy grow to match that need. In one scene,  Virginia reads a note smuggled to her by Flor. While Gamboa narrates  Flor's suffering, Adlawan suggests--by the inwardness of her crouch,  the bend of her neck--how deeply she feels Flor's words. Aguiluz  clothes her in shadows, implying Virginia's total immersion in Flor's  state of mind, a state of near-total despair. It's a tribute to the  director and both actresses that with the simplest of devicesa  crouched posture, a bit of darkness, and a voice-over--they bring us  totally inside the souls of these two women.  It's instructive to see how The Flor Contemplacion Story and Bagong  Bayani stage identical scenes: when the children visit their mother in  Flor, Lamangan plunks a glass sheet wide as a panoramic movie screen  between them, the better to see Nora act; Aguiluz chooses  verisimilitude, using a cramped little barred window. This effectively  forces the children to contort uncomfortably to see her face, making  you think: they aren't even allowed a good look at their mother. In  Flor, Lamangan forces Nora to dominate the scenes; in Bayani, Aguiluz  has them talk as normal people in their situation talk: greetings  first, then important business, then small talk, then despairing  silence. The progression happens quietly and naturally; finally Flor  and her children are reduced to pressing their palms to each other  through the glass.  The mix of dramatization and documentary recalls The Thin Blue Line,  about the arrest and conviction of an innocent man for murder. Line  attempted to deconstruct events, repeating them over and over again  until you see the contradictions in the prosecution's case against the  accused; Bayani assumes Flor's innocence, giving the Singaporean  version only a token glance. It might have helped Bayani's case to  adopt a more objective tone, giving time to both sides (but then, we  wouldn't have all these wonderful performances). As it is, Bayani  doesn't seem concerned with the question of guilt so much as with  depicting Flor's life, at which it succeeds, vividly. The use of  documentary footage broadens the implications of her story, turning it  into the story of all OCWs abroad.  From The Manila Chronicle, June 95"]},

", "First of all, lets make it clear that this is not the film to come to if you are expecting anything intelligent or worthwhile about the conflict in Bosnia; if that is your aim then I would suggest maybe Saviour as a starting point but certainly not this film. However if you want a standard action movie that happens to use the bleak washed out colours of a war zone to add character as well as using the war to make lots of things go bang then this should do you  as long as you can stop your brain from thinking about the morals of using such a conflict to make a flag-waving, simplistic piece of Saturday night entertainment. The plot aspires to being some sort of serious piece about the conflict based around an action movie but it is nothing of the sort. Instead the conflict is very simplified for the purposes of leaving our brains free enough of worry and moral concern for our fellow man to be able to just enjoy things going bang. The plot sees an American soldier evade the bad guys with the aim of defeating them against the odds  it doesn't matter who the bad guys are because they are a device rather than real people  they could have been black (Black Hawk Down), Muslim (The Siege) or French (SWAT) but here they happen to be Bosnian. We don't need to worry too much about this because the film doesn't really do anything with them other than use them as the baddies to the blonde and clean cut Burnett's goodie. ", "I'm sure I'll get bashed as anti-American for saying things like that but that is not my intention and I'd like to think I'm just being objective; lets be honest, this is just an action movie and shouldn't be looked on as anything more. However even judged on the standards of action movies this is only an average affair, with a plot that destroys its own tension by making Burnett increasingly bullet-proof as the film goes on, leading to a climax that reminded me of the laughable ending to Rambo 3. It does have tension early on but it has blown it by the ending, and the simplistic approach to a real war is hardly helpful. The direction tries to cover the gaps by using advertising gimmicks of jump cuts and freeze frames  they aren't a replacement for content but at least they make the film a bit more interesting. Ignoring the morals of it, the use of the frozen war zone does create atmosphere really easily and it was used well.", "With Hackman too old to be repeating his Bat-21 role, Wilson steps up and, aside from his usual comic stuff at the start, plays it pretty straight and has clearly aimed to be nothing more than an all-American kid just doing his duty. He aims for this and this is all he does which, in an action movie, is fine  however I kept thinking of Denis Quaid and thought how much braver he was in his choices. Hackman must have done about 2 or 3 weeks work on this film given 95% of his scenes are in one main location; he is OK but really just phones this in. The support cast is interesting in regards the Americans (people like Keith and 24's Almeida) but no effort is made on the side of the 'enemy' who are simply goons and baddies from the get go. Again it all works fine in a dumb action movie but the real setting in such a terrible conflict made me hope for more than just action fodder.", "Overall this is an average action movie with a bullet-proof hero taking on baddies who look different (black, Eastern European, Muslim, whatever) to bring good to the world of evil. On this level it is nothing special although it has some nice touches of style along the way but gets silly as it comes to the end. However morally it had a responsibility to really use this stage to do more with the conflict than just use it as a backdrop. Sadly it just paints everyone as the baddies and only looks for the emotion of cheering 'our guys' on rather than feeling anything for the real people or real country. Saviour may be bleak and depressing as a film but my god it is easier to stomach at times than this was. If you want things going bang then it should do you but you'd best try to switch off your brain, morals and heart before you start watching it."]},

With few friends despite an ample dose of after-school activities, she's an ever zealous, extremely bright student whose naturally superlative work is often, at least to the teachers, inconspicuous. She's on the diving squad, sings in the class musical and consistently gets high marks in school, but yet it seems perhaps too natural for anyone to notice, a physical and emotional overload with no room for exultation.", "Along with her busy schoolwork, she also has to embody an almost mother-infant relationship with her physically and mentally disabled younger brother, who's facing another possible stint at institutionalism.", "Given, with little time to even stop and catch her breath and less time to be a kid, it's remarkable she still ends up being exuberantly individualistic, taking whatever time she has left to learn and discover something new, and it's this non-conformist and resourcefully intellectual sense of self that puts her at odds with the more vacuous, angrier \"cool kids\" in her class.", "Whether it be her innocently but repeatedly upstaging them in practically every class, her equally graceful ignorance of their tauntingly unctuous invitations or her modest, tomboyish apparel, she becomes the center of their unreasonably cruel string of pranks and lunch-hour hazing. They verge from the more emotionally harming (sarcastic physical mockery and some rather vile name-calling) to the more violent intrusions of personal safety (locking her in the bathroom and eviscerating her treasured bike), all of which strike the earnest, usually attentive school officials and Merel's parents as alarmingly unforeseen.", "In turns out that her only sense of comfort is in an English-speaking train-stop acquaintance, whose perpetual smile earns her trust, but it's ultimately his soft-spoken wisdom and the universal lessons that casually nurture her through their brief but enriching encounters. A lesser director might have him blanket a nefarious agenda, but he is ultimately Merel's eye of the hurricane, one to bolster both her self-esteem as well as her mental ascension from a precarious childhood mind to a woman with a firm grasp of herself and the people around her (as well as giving her the film's title nickname)", "Ultimately, Merel (and the movie) comes to her character's pivotal crossroad, if she succumbs to peer pressure and compromises her individuality, or if she rejects the school's inanely shallow bullies and strives to draw friends who respect her special, richly defined persona.", "\"Bluebird\" is, inevitably, a very conventional movie (it was previously an after-school special in the Netherlands before going to the big screen), but it's neither a stale or cynical one, just resoundingly pure. It squarely focuses on Merel's point-of-view (she's in every scene), and while it gives the movie perhaps a lop-sided feel when it deals with her interactions with the school bullies (they remain malevolent, and often indistinguishable; perhaps a true statement on the nature of bullying itself, but without any of their viewpoints, this particular aspect of \"Bluebird\" has a noticeable lack of dimension), it doesn't damper a movie still rich with keen, non-condescending insight on the often anxious and terrifying time of moving from the innocence of childhood to the self-defining responsibility of being a young adult.", "And it's all superbly carried by the young Rotteveel, who here radiates a seamlessly endearing mix of a precocious sense of original taste and dependability as well as a youthfully sensitive vulnerability, especially when her tribulations, during and corresponding to the harsher interpersonal situations, can't be easily handled. Most movies would only dare to focus on one aspect to swiftly move the story along, but here Rotteveel deftly adds layers to her beleaguered but exceptional character, peeling each one to show her character's burgeoning maturity with a natural, impressive ease. Even with all the trials and hardships that befall upon Merel, Rotteveel's instincts, just like the simple but lovingly resonant charms of \"Bluebird\", are resiliently sound."]},

Although it is slightly confusing in the beginning, as the episodes go on, you get a better idea of what's going on and the characters really start to grow on you. Although there are a few obvious red-shirts, a lot of these characters are killed in a messy and upsetting fashion--just like in real war. There are lots of noble sacrifices, but perhaps even more pointless deaths, failed attempts at making a heroic sacrifice, and most of all, an overarching sense of dread throughout the entire series. This is one of the only Gundam stories where it was really hard to tell who was going to come out on top when the dust had cleared.", "A true epic spanning over fifty episodes, V Gundam doesn't necessarily tie up all the loose ends, or explain everything perfectly. But that's part of the point; in a real war, so many people are involved, it's nearly impossible to fully understand what is truly going on. The gamut of characters here is staggering. Some fall into typical anime stereotypes, but most of them are refreshing and interesting in their own rights.", "Quite a few of the scenes were shocking, and it isn't for the faint hearted. This is certainly the most downcast of all Gundam series, save perhaps Z Gundam. War crimes are the norm; the body count consistently rises; children, even younger than usual (the main character is 13) are thrown in as cannon fodder; and a general lack of ethics is displayed at pretty much every turn by all sides of the conflict. But this makes the series all the more compelling. It doesn't rely on cheap over-use of gore and violence, but instead real drama.", "If you like any Gundam, and have a familiarity with the UC timeline, I highly suggest V Gundam."]},

On the surface, this is straightforward industrial intrigue and adventure, with some sci-fi elements added to the mix. But the most original and appealing aspect is the relentless comic charm given off by the series' sexy, but terminably cheery heroine, Cleopatra Corns, chair and CEO of the giant conglomerate, the Corns Group. Operating out of her own New York City skyscraper, the teenaged Cleo exclaims \"Hi, New York! You're looking fine today,\" as she races her sports car out of her building's garage and into the city's traffic. Surprisingly hands-on for a CEO, her day's work includes rescuing damsels (and companies) in distress, going so far as to fly, via rocket pack, into the heart of a Saudi Arabian oil refinery to head off a disastrous oil fire. And the leggy, buxom blonde does it all while parading a steady stream of dazzling, eye-popping outfits. Despite the provocative fashions and semi-nude scenes, there's never a hint of romance or sex; Cleo's simply too busy rescuing (even younger) girls and saving the world from a corrupt rival conglomerate.", "The first two episodes are 30 minutes each, while the last, and best, is 50 minutes. In \"Lightning Bolt of Apollo,\" Cleo is called on to intervene when a playboy oil tycoon tries to woo a client's daughter by kidnapping her. The action takes her to Saudi Arabia and an armed confrontation which requires a phone call to President Bush (the Elder) for approval of the use of an ICBM. \"Crystal Pharaoh\" details the fight over a powerful diamond needed for use in a super-destructive weapon. The action involves a space shuttle and an attempt to shoot it down. More of a straight science fiction piece, the final episode, \"Pandora's Box,\" finds Cleo on vacation in Nice, but forced to harbor a runaway girl who turns out to be a super-android created by an evil arms dealer. Cleo dubs her \"Sara\" (after the heroine of the novel, \"The Little Princess\") and tries to protect her from mercenaries on her trail. When Sara turns up at NORAD in the Rocky Mountains with the express purpose of launching all of America's nuclear missiles, Cleo and her team are in a race against time and have to make another call to the President.", "\nWhile the character design and animation style are unmistakably 1980s in look and tone, favoring angular features, long-limbed bodies, bold linework, and bright primary colors, there are some rather unusual and distinguishing features, including the girls' oversized but incredibly detailed pupils set in the center of eyes encircled by a lush field of long, flowing lashes. There's a deceptively simple, but highly original, eye-catching style employed here that makes it all eminently watchable even when the storyline gets a little confusing (as it does during the oil company machinations in the first episode). The relatively simple painted backgrounds are perfectly suited to the stylized action. While the stories invariably begin and end in New York, the backdrops include Saudi Arabia, Nice, and the Rocky Mountains. New Yorkers will enjoy the glimpses of Times Square, Central Park and Coney Island. The jazz-inflected score includes a couple of catchy songs sung in English.", "American viewers need to be warned about a couple of bits of action that may hit a little too close to home. In the first sequence, a small plane crashes into a New York skyscraper (pre-9/11) with, miraculously, no deaths, while in the second episode, a space shuttle explodes (post-Challenger) with an equally miraculous lack of fatalities."]},

Plot finds Law as W.P. Inman, a wounded deserter from the Confederate army who is trying to make his way back to North Carolina to rekindle a fledgling romance with Ada Monroe (Kidman). ", "This is Minghella's world and the American Civil War movie gets a double shot in the arm as Cold Mountain not only deals in the home front, but also in the perilous life of the soldier. Add into the mix a fire cracker of an opening, a central romance and an array of expertly drawn characters, and it's safe to say that Minghella's film is not only epic in production, but also in story telling. In essence the film is about love, friendships and learning to cope under the most trying of circumstances, but the director doesn't paint it with a sentimental brush. As the three strands of the narrative play out, tone is often gritty, intense, sorrowful even, with Minghella cribbing from the Anthony Mann Western book by having the stunning landscapes form part of the characters emotional world. ", "Come back to me, come back to me ", "Story is strong, even if the key romance is soft; since it's told mostly in flash backs, but those flash backs are threaded into the main seam of Ada's life on the home front and Inman's perilous odyssey. She, befriended by hard working, dirty handed, Ruby Thewes (Zellewegger excellent); who also provides the only moments of levity within, he, meeting up with a number of interesting characters, both good and bad. This of course makes the film episodic, but in this instance it's a good thing, mainly because characters are so utterly compelling. Hoffman as a less than honourable priest and Portman as a young woman out in a wood cabin, alone with her sick baby, they stand out. But there's also the Home Guard attached enforcers led by blood thirsty Teague (Winstone) and a potent thread involving Ruby's fiddle playing father, Stobrod (Gleeson as usual a considerable screen presence). ", "On the technical front it's hard to find fault, it's a tip top production. Romania's mountains, rolling hills and forests form the backdrop to most of the action, with John Seale's Academy Award nominated photography neatly passing for a rugged North Carolina. While the costumes, set design and Yared's score also add impetus to the feel of the time. There's some minor itches, such as fluctuating accents and the delicacy of the romance lacking the passion to drive such a journey by Inman on, but they are not flaws. Such is the strength of Minghella's story telling ability, Cold Mountain still comes out as great cinema. A film that can stay in your mind for days after viewing it. Bleak yet subtle, savage yet tender, a different sort of Civil war movie. Amen to that. 9/10"]},

The first part tells the story of how Yo Hinamura, a sensitive young Japanese sculptor, is forcibly enlisted by the Hong Kong-based 108 Dragons and trained and programmed to become one of their top assassins. He gets his name, Crying Freeman, from the fact that he yearns to be free despite his programming and sheds a visible stream of tears after each killing.", "The core of this chapter is Freeman's relationship with a lonely young Japanese woman, Emu Hino, after she witnesses his killing of a Hong Kong crime lord. She knows Freeman is coming to eliminate her as a witness and he knows she knows it. Before he comes for her, she paints a portrait of him with his gun outstretched. When he does arrive and sees the painting, he begins the process of changing his mind about her. A real love develops between the two and eventually he has to convince the leaders of the 108 to let her join him wherever he goes. The police and the Yakuza gangs in Japan learn of her connection to Freeman and go after her as well.", "The romantic elements of the story include a passionate sex scene between Freeman and Emu that falls just shy of the near-pornographic depiction of it in the manga. There are additional scenes of sex and nudity. In one, the widow of a Yakuza gang boss has sex in a funeral home closet with a corrupt police inspector during her husband's funeral.", "There's quite a lot of bloodshed and killing as Freeman performs his various assassinations (generally of underworld figures) and fends off attacks by other killers out to stop him. Freeman's ability to hit his targets with dead-on accuracy with knives or bullets and his practically superhuman acrobatic skills, enabling him to leap up or down out of harm's way, give the fight scenes a slightly fantastic air that recalls Hong Kong action films in the way the act of killing is transformed into an act of performance.", "Most importantly, although the anime is rendered in brilliant colors, it painstakingly captures the drama and elegance of the manga's black-and-white drawings with breathtaking accuracy. Daisuke Nishio, the director of this installment (better known for his DRAGON BALL Z films), captures the sense of time, place and mood so expertly conveyed in the manga, but also knows how to expand on the action and how to pace a scene properly for animation. The whole sequence at Emu's dark, sprawling mansion as she waits for Freeman to come after her is a masterpiece in the use of lighting, décor, closeups and staging of the characters to enhance the mood of foreboding, death, erotic passion and hope. Time and again in this 52-minute adaptation the anime captures the stark imagery and swift, violent action of the manga as beautifully as this reviewer has ever seen it done.", "The \"Crying Freeman\" manga has also been adapted into two live-action films, CRYING FREEMAN (1995), directed by Christophe Gans (BROTHERHOOD OF THE WOLF) and starring Mark Dacascos, and a Hong Kong action film, KILLER'S ROMANCE (1990), starring Simon Yam and Joey Wang. Neither compares favorably with this first anime adaptation."]},

Rodolfo Brandão's only film as director \"Dedé Mamata\" (first name is the main character and the last name is a Brazilian term that translates as \ndishonest gain) is a fine example of great cinema of the 1980's in Brazil which combines entertaining elements with historical/political moments that reveals \nour nation as we were back in that decade and somewhat what we still are in current days. We haven't changed one iota 30 years later.\n \nBackground: Dedé hardly knew his parents since their were revolutionary oppposed to the military regime in the late 1960's. Living with his senile \ngrandfather the young Dedé (played by Guilherme Fontes) is somewhat connected with those communists comrades since they're loyal to his father cause and they send him \nmoney or ask him to provide him a safe place to stay since they're still persecuted by the military. At the same time he provides all those things, he feels inclined \nto a certain sense of freedom, power and money due to his connections with a friend (Marcos Palmeira), an acquaintance of a top drug dealer (Luiz Fernando Guimarâes) \nwho asks him to join him in his ventures to get lots of money. Different life styles and ideologies, Dedé is trapped in what side to choose and whom to protect and \ndefend: the family's side who is opposed to the Capitalism side of thing or enjoying the benefits money can bring and fulfill in his life. Parallel to that, comes the women \nin his life: a new neighbor who falls for him (played by Malu Mader) and a college girl interested in him (played by Iara Jamra). \n \nBrandão's film is a nice example of presenting a conflicting character who is torn between different ideologies, thoughts, lifestyle and also the possibilites of whom to \nchoose between friendships and love; dealing with politics without being much didatic and concerning about our reality back in a time when we were crawling after 21 years of \nmiliaries in power; so it was a time to speak about our anguish and expectations after harsh years of censorship, problems and silence in all communications against our powers \nof be. All we know is that Dedé is opposed to them in all ways not just because of his family story but also because he's a rebel who doesn't have a job, uses drugs and isn't \nseen as an example figure to the regime and can be easily spotted if he does something wrong as usual when it comes to youth. Fontes plays this guy with a great flair just as he \ndid previously as the sax player in \"Um Trem para as Estrelas\" (1987). He's convincing, naive but also carrying some intelligence, trying to find ways out to solve his problems or \nmore interested in his books than in having a nice moment with a girl.\n \nQuarells with the film...well, there was some. It lacks in some bite, more thrilling events happening to the main character or some great jabs on the regime - but a powerful \nmoment comes when his grandfather on the wheelchair while getting a night out admires a new color TV on the store gets an excited reaction even though he doesn't talk or move at all is \na masterful example of a powerful scene (a Comunist veteran who admires the grace of Capitalism power). The romance thing between Dedé and the girls is quite weak in parts, isn't \nchallenging enough for the viewers in believing in it. Yet, those are minor complaints from this reviewer.

Like earlier films from structuralist filmmakers, such as Hollis Frampton's \"Lemon\" (1969), the film focuses entirely on the element of lighting and its use within the frame, with stark contrasts as compared to soft shadowing as in most conventional films. To achieve this concept, Gehr goes in a different direction than others: using a piece of archive footage and slowing down the film in order to play with said contrasts, rather than doing a more in-detail look at lighting as a tool. In terms of being an interesting film, \"Eureka\" is more just an experiment than anything else, with most of the interest coming from the historical aspect than what the filmmaker seeks to create.", "The setting is Market Street 1906, and the footage is a silent documentary film entitled \"A Trip Down Market Street Before the Fire\". The entirety of Gehr's work on the film is to slow it down 5x and bring down the image quality so low that the light and dark parts of the image are severely emphasized. Being one who has watched and reviewed a ton of silent films, I can't say this effect is particularly impressive when presented on its own: plenty of silent films could look like this, and because of how the medium worked back then, there are similar poor prints where the contrasts indeed look as stark as in here. When one views the original film used for this short, it's easier to see how heavily doctored the print is and hence maybe be able to get what Gehr was trying to do better. The concept remains interesting, but the execution carried out on footage of this era is no surprise if one is already familiar with the fact plenty of 1906 films and otherwise already looked this bad (without even trying). As a result, and while not ignoring what the filmmaker's intentions were, much of the interest in this film comes from seeing the actual historical footage rather than any artistic standpoint."]},

It's dated, but if you grew up watching old Hannah Barbara cartoons like I did, it's actually pretty well animated. You have to go in knowing the nature of the original film trilogy: it's a series abridged and because of this the pacing is kind of weird. Basically, it's episodes stitched together, with 'filler' removed and improved animation. I liked it a fair bit. There's actually some gorgeous matte paintings to be found throughout, and the shot composition keeps things visually interesting. There's also none of the anime tropes that I find annoying (those tend to permeate through 2000s-2010s shows). So, a lot of positives. I think due to the shortening, some side characters that presumably got a lot of mundane things to do aren't developed as well as they could have been. The pacing is still rather slow, though I don't mind that so much. And, it does end on a note that doesn't seem incredibly impactful.", "Overall this was a great first Gundam experience, and every second I watched improved that one moment in Ready Player One."]},

Pauline Curley is pretty good as the love interest as well. The biggest problem is that the story is pretty straight-forward and nothing ever happens to build up any drama as there's no a second where you actually think Phillips is going to fail in his quest. The ending seems to have been influenced by THE BIRTH OF A NATION as the sister and her young brother are trapped in the house with the bad guys trying to break in a kill them and we must wait for the hero to rush to the scene. The sequence isn't nearly as intense as that in the Griffith film though."]},

It's not something that would appeal to most folks, but those who are familiar with \"M\" and love it, then this is an intriguing sort of film.

Just before they are to embark for a trip to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Karen says she is going on vacation by herself to \"think about everything.\" Matthew and Victor decide to go to Rio with their daughters. The magical atmosphere of Rio, as if saturated with eroticism and languid lusts, takes them by surprise. Victor hunts for every woman, and Matthew, faithful to his wife, modestly accompanies his daughter in her entertainment. But the exciting Brazilian rhythms and frank dances on the moonlit beach do their job. Unable to resist the relentless onslaught of the young seducer, Matthew enters into an intimate relationship with her. Victor is furious when he finds out about an \"older man\" in his daughter's life, and sets out to hunt him down with the aid of Matthew.", "American businessman Victor (Joseph Bologna) and British-born entrepreneur Matthew (Michael Caine) are best friends who work for a major corporation in São Paulo, Brazil. Both are having problems in their marriages: Victor's wife wants to divorce him, while Matthew has no idea what is wrong and is baffled and irritated by the decision of his wife Karen (Valerie Harper) to take her vacation separately from her husband and daughter.", "The men decide to holiday in Rio de Janeiro. With them are their teenage offspring: Matthew's 15-year-old daughter Nikki (Demi Moore) and Victor's 16-year-old daughter Jennifer (Michelle Johnson).

Victor becomes occupied with a woman named Isabella, so Matthew returns to the beach to find the girls. Caught up in the wedding celebration, Jennifer and Matthew remove their clothes and join the party in the water. Jennifer kisses Matthew passionately, and then runs to a secluded cove. Matthew pursues her to protest, but the young girl seduces him and they make love.", "The next morning, while Victor and Nicky have breakfast, Jennifer teases Matthew as he shaves. He insists they act as if the previous night never happened, but she extracts a kiss. When Jennifer joins her father and Nicky, she has shaving cream on her face, but claims it is whipped cream. Nicky, who saw Jennifer kiss Matthew the previous night, leaves the table. Matthew becomes increasingly nervous when Jennifer flirts with him in front of her father.", "In the evening, Matthew and Victor prepare dinner while discussing discuss their daughters.

In the early hours of the morning, Jennifer returns to the room she shares with Nicky, but bumps into Victor, and he wonders why she is up so late.

Matthew hastily packs and plans to return to Sao Paolo, but Victor begs him to stay to learn the identity of Jennifer's lover. Pretending to help his friend, Matthew takes Jennifer to lunch and she offers him a nude photograph of herself. He refuses the gift, but decides to lie to Victor and tell him that Jennifer would not reveal her lover's identity. Matthew encourages Jennifer to go out with a nineteen-year-old boy named Bernardo. When the boy brings Jennifer home, she abruptly ends his kiss.", "Meanwhile, Nicky returns home from her date and is confronted by Matthew, who wants to know where she has been. She admits to her knowledge of his affair with Jennifer. Later, Matthew seeks guidance from the holy woman. At the house, Victor finds Jennifer's diary and shares it with Matthew, but her writings do not reveal her lover's name, only that he is 43-years-old and has blue eyes.

She has few choices for preserving what generations of Niskavuoris have built.", "The chemistry among these three actors, and to a lesser extent the neurotic, nattering, eyelash-batting wife, is exceptional.", "The film plays quickly, but along the way we see a variety of occasions and characters portrayed with Kassila's characteristic attention to detail: reaping and threshing, tea with the vicar, exuberant barn dancing, the telephone operator as consummate village snoop and gossip, the vibrant young schoolteacher, the master of Niskavuori torn between duty and destiny.", "As usual in Kassila's films of this sort, the smell, taste, and texture of Finland fairly leap off the screen.", "The dialogue is a particularly strong point of \"Niskavuori\", distilling the characters' thoughts to an essence of historical currents, to words one would never hear in such perfection from real people, yet which seem exactly right in the context of the film.  They contribute to the sense of heightened reality, the awareness that we are witnessing not merely individuals in conflict but the colliding and swirling currents of destiny.", "Satu Silvo is ravishing in the role of the schoolteacher -- intellectual, modern, and sensual all at once.  Esko Salminen is the picture of Finnish manhood at the time, vigorous, boisterous, but saddled with the obligations of a society in flux and a neighboring Russia threatening to swallow the entire country as it would swallow all the Baltic states across the gulf. Rauni Luoma is thoroughly convincing as the indomitable but world-weary matron of Niskavuori.", "This is a film that deserves to be seen outside of Finland.  Because it is so richly and topically Finnish, it defies true comparison, but it is on the order of \"O Pioneers!\" or Troell-Moberg's \"The Emigrants\".  It would play to the current hunger for substance and tradition, much as \"My Life as a Dog\" did in its time -- but this is a more serious film, a feast of historical insight and detail presented in an engaging and easily digestible form."]},

There is a little plea at the beginning of the film to ' forgive them their trespasses ' which means in this case a line-up of youths whipping another youth, two rapes, knife cuts to a face and and a sort of Romeo and Juliet ending which I will not reveal. The initial plea fell on deaf ears for me, and its Christian overtones. For a shoddy little film set in a no-man's land where puny rebels without a cause meet a band of gypsies it had a great deal of good actors. Pierre Vaneck, Gianni Esposito ( noted for his role in the superb Rivette film, ' Paris Nous Appartient ' ) and of course Marina Vlady. The only one who added life to this melodrama was Gianni Esposito. Vaneck looked pale and beautiful and bored, while Marina Vlady changed from promising tomboy to simply an object of sex appeal, almost ending up like Anna Karenin. The film is in fact a confused mess, which also includes female gypsy dancers flinging themselves absurdly across the screen. In the shortish playing time of one hour and twenty minutes they took up too much time, and the film score is horrendous. Robert Hossein makes a few line appearance which added nothing to this failure of a film which time has not been kind to. I give it a 4 for its misunderstood teenagers genre ( Hollywood did better with such films as ' Crime in the Streets ' and ' No Time to be Young ' ) and for Gianni Esposito and his screen presence."]},

However, the film's real media value is as a historical documentary on the greatest salsa musicians of all time- the Fania All Stars. Historic also, because it was the first time the great Celia Cruz played with the Fania stars. Ray Baretto, \"Hard Hands\" did his thing side by side with the great master Cuban percussionist, Mongo Santamaria. Also, a vintage look at Hector Lavoe, \"The Voice\", the naturally talented and raw salsa singer who was the subject of the recent film- El Cantante. Performing also was African musician, Manu Dibango who illustrated the influence of African rhythm in salsa music. Another highlight in the film is a performance by El Gran Combo de Puerto Rico who today are recognized as- The University of Salsa Music; for their: over 40 years of great music and performances and more than 50 albums. They recently had a long overdue recognition by being awarded a Latin Grammy for best Latin Music Album. The film provides the rare opportunity to see perform together the great Fania musicians/arrangers: Willie Colon-grand trombonist, Johnny Pacheco, Larry Harlow, Nicky Marrero, Bobby Valentin, Yomo Toro, Roberto Roena, The best ever salsa singers: Pete \"El Conde\" Rodriguez, Julio Betancourt, Santos Colon, Hector Lavoe (he merits mention again), Ismael Miranda, Cheo Feliciano, Ismael Quintana. Another treat was Jorge \"Malo\" Santana performing with the Fania All Stars, he is the brother of the legend, Carlos Santana and a pretty good guitarist himself--definitely in the genes. The documentary aspect of the film re:the roots of Latin performing arts in the US was interesting. Geraldo Rivera is host/narrator- a few years earlier he was legal counsel for the Young Lords Party, the Puerto Rican counterpart to the Black Panther Party. Honorable mention was given (film clips) of early Latin artists such as Desi Arnez, Carmen Miranda. Delores del Rio, Rita Rio. I can watch this repeatedly and be entertained every time, also a great party film, especially among OG salsa fans."]},

There were a few scenes that caused me to laugh hysterically and that is unusual for me. Although Mariel Hemmingway has never been a favorite of mine, she definitely brings strong acting talent to this movie. Her wardrobe is interesting yet appropriate for the scenes in the movie. Mike Binder does a great job of carrying the movie with a combination of almost dramatic acting skills but definite ability as a straight man and the occasional goof ball. Missy Crider is always a good actress, in this movie I don't think she was given a strong enough role and the role she had did not give her adequate room to demonstrate her true skills or to allow her usual sensual self to come through. I believe the movie would have been much better had Mariel and Missy had each other's roles. But obviously the director thought otherwise. Directors always have the right to be wrong I guess. Warning; do not let the title or the movie synopsis fool you. There is almost nothing erotic about this movie. It is funny, but not erotic. The jacket suggests a lot of lesbian activity. Most of that activity is not seen however but alluded to or happens with the camera elsewhere. On the eroticism scale this movie is a 2 out of 10. There is also very little nudity. For the most part (with the exception of what I noted above) the movie was well cast. The plot is plausible but the sequence of events is not, hence we have a clever comedy. I recommend this movie for a good laugh only. It is not a movie to watch for the whole family due to the adult theme of lesbianism and sexual threesomes. As a non-erotic comedy I would rate this 6 out of 10."]},

Harun Farocki, in \"Inextinguishable Fire\", famously attempted to communicate the horror of napalm by asking the audience member to imagine a cigarette burn and then multiply the effect by a thousand. In Side/Walk/Shuttle a shot starts from the sidewalk, all the little details, flags fluttering, pedestrians, people and cars go by, then you go up from the small reality, then you've got the whole block, pretty soon you're high over the city, and finally you can see a grid of these realities, with Telegraph Hill and Coit Tower in the distance, the whole city comes alive by multiplication. This particular shot carried me away with some, admittedly very subjective, religious feelings, as if I was looking at a Caspar David Friederich landscape (Friedrich was a nineteenth century German Romantic painter). I suppose it's quite unique San Francisco in having a skyline of grids and then this one unique art deco structure that bit higher up. It reminds me of the Friedrich painting Morning in the Riesengebirge (Charlottenburg Palace, Berlin), where a pinnacle with a crucifix sits in front of waves of misty peaks.", "I kind of liked how I could see different times of day, on the ground there were buses plunging into deep shadow, higher up there's still naked sun. It reminded me of being up the Eiffel Tower as a teenager and seeing the sunset, with the streets below already in evening. The colours in the movie are interesting, shades of turquoise, with most other colours struggling to show. Turquoise light coruscations on building faces as cloud shadows pass, red cars (red struggling out of brown). Buildings become chocolate-coloured coffered slabs, sideways up, when the shot is at 90 degrees, it looks like a horizontal track. So more and more in the movie Gehr decontextualises the image, and the city looks more and more like something it's not. ", "The shot goes upside down, and the city hangs from the earth. I remembered a childhood dream where gravity reversed. and if you weren't careful, you fell into space. Later another shot has me thinking of science fiction, of a future city that hangs from beneath a giant superstructure, like barnacles on a hull. Skyscrapers on their side can look like new and quite exciting buildings, like eastern European behemoths such as Ceaucescu's Palace of the Parliament, imagining they are as wide as they are long.", "Out of the Babel-sound comes beauty, I think two of the most pleasurable sounds I know of are in the movie, early-afternoon faintly heard classical music practice and budgerigar chirping - sounds of civilised domesticity.", "There's a sort of ineffable peace to the whole movie, heightened by the sound though just as much there when the sounds goes. Sometimes the sound carries British accents, and sounds like Camden Market in London, other times it's a restaurant. An accordion playing brought to mind the old world, and San Francisco's origins as a city of immigrants.", "Gehr wants to play little games as well, in what's often a film of subtleties, he reverses time, so you can see all the cars move slowly backwards. Basically I think the movie is a masterpiece of aesthetics."]},

FOOD CHAIN's local release on Friday came, to put it mildly, as a happy surprise. Its credits aren't as auteurish so I suspect his shrewd collaborators got behind what must've been a hard sell of this unique talent.  To the best of my knowledge, or at least taste, there's no other director, including his brilliant fellow Manitoban Guy Maddin, who can take such deadpan, shamelessly bizarre humour and make it so side-splitting.", "To dispute its absolute originality, TOP OF THE FOOD CHAIN shares a craziness of concept with 1984's BIG MEAT EATER, another micro-budget Canuck item (something in our water?)  Rather than the conventional smug mockery of 50s drive-in sci-fi (oh look at Woody and the giant tit, how droll and cunning) these films strive to be, in look and feel, a modern day continuation of a time-locked genre that had logic and principles of its very own, though so free form that comic expression can flourish on a wide open range.  While MEAT EATER, a delightful though haphazardly directed mess, was marginally a musical remake of PLAN 9, FOOD CHAIN takes its initial premise from from the interesting ASTOUNDING SHE MONSTER, complete with the strangely lit alien sexpot in the woods and main characters that are somewhat similar to the ones here.  It's clear that the actors are in improvisation heaven but Paizs, in the tradition of Altman and Morrissey at their best, never lets them stray from his story telling vision.  And what a vision: this is like MARAT/SADE!  It's a 50s monster melodrama concieved, produced and acted out by mental patients!", "Not a single character in this movie even attempts to approximate socially acceptable behavior, nor does anyone, even on a good guy/villain level, ever question one another's unusualness.  Sexual obsessions spring up all over the place but are pointedly ignored in terms of detail, as if Paizs is taking on the role of gossippy spinster aunt who knows where to cut things off for decency's sake.  It doesn't stop there.  He interrupts things, though briefly enough to maintain the flow, to point out things of visual interest, like a hideously familiar faux-wicker basket full of saltines, that you just know you once saw in your own childhood home.  He actually has the gall to reuse enjoyed props within the same sequence: a bright pink hugely finned bulgemobile ('59 Pontiac?) appears in the background during both takes on an opposite-angled dialogue.  Even the FX showcase at the grand climax, suitably tacky looking by today's standards, he undermines with swift dispatch that makes it clear that the characters are far more interested in each other's activities of the moment than any impending doom."]},

The whole movie has an exploitative air about it, typical of the early seventies' Brazilian movies where lots of naked women and sexual thematics were used to attract audiences. This one is a notch above the rest, perhaps. The camera-work is characterized by the relentless use of zoom, that gives a cheap air to the movie. Notice that at 44 minutes into the movie a 1970 calendar appears in one scene; this, and the fact that Murilo Nery won a Best Supporting Actor award at the 1970 Santos Film Festival for his performance in this film, establish beyond any doubt that this film was released in 1970.

Between watching Mil Mascaras and his partner Superzan just stand around trying to figure out the vampire murders, and watching the titular heroine run around acting scared, I was REALLY hard put not to fast forward this thing. Even the ring action is just barely perfunctory(I refuse to believe that Mascaras couldn't be given something more to do). The dead givaway is when the token, non-wrestling male love interest (a doctor, presumably, dressed in the latest fashion straight from Miller's Outpost)is actually given more action scenes than the wrestlers! Unforgivable! The ONLY reason to watch this snoozer is the scene in the vampire's manor, where Mascaras and Superzan wrestle a mob of--I kid you not--vampire dwarves! WOW! These little guys can really rassle! Just the memory of our heroes bouncing these freaky little knee-biters off the red velvet-lined walls, like so many bloodsucking nerf-balls makes me crack up even as I type this. Otherwise, I haven't been so bored with a lucha flick since \"Santo and The Tigress\". Take my advice give this one a qualified pass.

We now live in a digital age where complicated camera tricks and sound are the norm. However, back in 1921, I am pretty sure this short from Educational Pictures* wowed audiences.

Occasionally throughout the film are a few other animated sequences--all done on the intertitle cards. What follows is supposedly a train racing out of control and not a whole lot of plot otherwise. To make the train look like it's going fast, they sped up the film, rocked the camera back and forth and manipulated the angle of the camera to make it appear like the decline of the track was much steeper than it was. Additionally, and this was amazing for 1921, it had an accompanying record that played music and sound effects which greatly enhanced the experience. While not a must-see for most folks today, it was a heck of a film for 1921.", "By the way, Educational Pictures really wasn't very educational. Mostly they made comedies and there wasn't anything educational about them--just laughs. Its title came from its early days where owner Earle Hammons made educational films for schools, though this sort of thing did not last and the name remained."]},

The series also won praise from the British Medical Association for allaying people's fear of hospitals, and in 1962 the then Minister of Health, Enoch Powell, congratulated the show on its 500th episode and commented on the useful job it did in reminding the public of the need for immunization.", "Although the series was high in drama it had a very low mortality rate (patient deaths were strictly limited to five per year), concentrating more on the lives of the men and women who staffed the hospital. There were, of course, none of the graphically visual blood and guts on show that audiences expect from medical dramas today especially in shows such as 'Casualty' or 'The Golden Hour.' Nevertheless, although sedate by today's standard the series did set a landmark in 1964 and courted a considerable amount of controversy with its portrayal of an interracial relationship between surgeon Louise Mahler (Joan Hooley) and Doctor Giles Farmer (John White) which included the first ever on-screen interracial kiss.", "The long list of patients who received treatment within 'EW10's' walls included Ian Hendry, Joanna Lumley and Albert Finney, all of whom went on to bigger and better things.

Grade later admitted it was; 'one of the two biggest mistakes of my life.' In 1972 he tried to revive the series as 'General Hospital,' although this had far lesser impact on viewers."]},

Of course, first cases they fail, and this series is about their (both physical and mental) development. The acting, or dramaturgy is nothing special, it's on the level of 1950's, although there are some breath-taking shots of wildlife, which sadly nowadays already have disappeared from the location of shot, so this movie is natural memento as well.

The Mafiosi weren't just \"the bad guys, because we say they are\", but were SHOWN to be bad by the ruthlessness of their behaviour. It was a classic \"buddy cop\" show, with one of the partners (If I recall correctly - and remember, we're going back 40 years here!) Neil McCallum playing an unfrocked Irish Catholic priest, and Stelio Candelli playing a reformed Mafioso. Both used the Mafia's techniques against the Mafia itself.

Director Ricks (in a non-sex role) and the appropriately named Chrissy Canfield are up first with the latter bearing witness and masturbating to a decent coupling of Scott Styles and Kimberly Jade, who was to gain unfortunate notoriety as one of the casualties of the late '90s HIV crisis that rocked the industry and could allegedly be traced back to performer Marc Wallice. The next couple are also split up as John Decker (a good actor when the material calls for it as Paul Thomas' MARISSA can attest) gets horny Hall in the garage while spouse Johnni Black does Davis in the upstairs bedroom.", "In my opinion, there's a lapse of logic when these hormonally driven ghostly apparitions send people scurrying for the nearest exit rather than make them want to buy the mansion pronto. So what if your sex partner disappears right after carnal consummation ? Some of us might consider that a bonus. Be that as it may, this latest failure at unloading the property prompts Kelly to utter the flick's funniest line : \"That's it ! I'm calling in a sexual exorcist !\" Enter the incredible Julie Rage, who delivered equally memorable performances in Greg Steelberg's IMPACT and THE CRAVING, as just such a sexorcist and, boy, does she look and act the part. Her sharp features can make her look fashion model gorgeous one moment and witchy the next, depending on how she's lit and photographed. Ricks makes clever use of this dichotomy and her big \"casting out of the spirits\" sequence proves the movie's highlight with Rage contorting that eerily lithe frame of hers into some rather weird positions to please both Mark and Roxanne simultaneously with Jill beating off on the sidelines.", "Perhaps the film should have stopped there, but Ricks suddenly remembered that no one had had sex with his leading lady yet so Kelly gets ravaged by Rage on the ornate staircase for a somewhat anti-climactic capper. It's rarely a good idea to end a flick with chick on chick shtick. Try saying that five times fast ! Aside from wasting the presence of its biggest star, the movie also suffers from its rather cheap, down-market look, accentuated by an otherwise really effective \"G.G. Steel\" (a/k/a Greg Steelberg) soundtrack that frequently seems far too grandiose for such a minimal affair."]},

We see a pantomime fable of Prometheus (Marc Wallice, of all people), humping a pair of mythical beauties (Roxanne Hall & Chloe Nichole), backed by the ethereal New Age music popular at the time in porn (Adam & Eve especially), and stylization of costume, lighting and wardrobe that is as dreamy as any Andrew Blake effort. Blake's influence at the time cannot be discounted.", "This segment of the film is resolved abruptly with Tedeschi in his photography studio, navel gazing in a philosophical way one doesn't associate with porn. His obsession with a self-invented mythical \"Blue Dahlia\" (personified by Misty Rain in severe fetish-gear carrying the flower) is quite strange and puts the viewer into a reflective mood. Avalon takes time out for a very hot & heavy sex scene between Tedeschi and his taskmaster business partner Shyla Foxxx, whose great personality and fabulous huge-breasted body had me scurrying to buy up her other feature films of the period.", "Avalon moves back into dream-quest mode with the arrival of models (Lauren Tracy and Sunny) for Tony as fashion photographer to shoot, but instead of doing his job we are treated to his reverie and imaginary sex scene with the beauties, staged in fond homage to Antonioni's classic David Hemmings with the \"birds\" sequence in \"Blow-Up\". When he comes to his senses, and it's revealed he hasn't really snapped a single shot, all hell breaks loose, Tony loses his livelihood and Foxxx literally kicks him out of his own studio, which she runs.", "At this point Avalon goes even more experimental, switching to black & white save for the blue in the frame representing Misty's cape and the blue flower she carries, as Tony symbolically pursues her on foot down railroad tracks leading to a tunnel. Another Adam & Eve label lookalike mythic scene in which Alex Sanders in long curly haired mane mode plays the God Pan (credits at the end comically call him \"Flute Guy\") humping spectacularly porcelain-white skinned Laura Palmer and the Dahlia herself in a pristine setting by a natural pond and rocks. This is pure beauty for its own sake, the dreamy sort of porn that soon went out of style after the arrival of the new millennium.", "Avalon ends the saga on a very ambiguous note, literally having our protagonist pursue his dream (girl) through a White Out doorway -impressive but perhaps bewildering. He has definitely dared to go way over the heads of the porn public, but I enjoyed the challenge and the DVD sits there in obscurity, just waiting for rediscovery. Perhaps if enough of these solid works from the past are revived and studied, the dark tunnel of gonzo which Adult Entertainment has entered can eventually be escaped by new artists with similar aspirations, countering the current repetition after repetition of basically prostituted sex for a fast buck."]},

The leading actress portrays the cold and cruel heartlessness of the beautiful cigar maker with appreciation and discretion. The Don Jose is well done, too. Staging and costuming are quite in harmony with the popular conception of the opera. Indeed, the producer has evidently employed the best talent procurable and has brought out a film which is notable, if, indeed, a film portraying a theme of this kind can be notable. Not once, but many times, the enchantress has appeared on the screen. Each rendition has possessed certain attractive features not produced by others. This picture is singularly well balanced dramatically and its mechanical perfection can scarcely be questioned. It is well worth seeing, even if one has seen all previous Carmens. Well done the opera never tires, and good reproductions on the films will never weary. The story contains so much of the weaknesses of humanity that it will be always popular. - The Moving Picture World, September 3, 1910"]},

But the war draws to a close, and Judith finds new romance, and Loveday suffers the consequences of a very hard decision, as she is forced to choose between Gus whom she loves, and her husband, Walter, the father of her young boy Nathaniel.", "Judith Dunbar's life is miserable when her parents and kid sister move to colonial Singapore. That is until her boarding school friend Loveday Carey-Lewis practically adopts her into her rich family, living on a glorious Cornwall country estate. There love blooms, but Judith leaves after Edward Carey-Lewis made love to her but did not propose marriage, as she stupidly presumed. In World War II tragedy keeps striking, but new love blossoms - and sports new sorrow. The allied victory and POW returns bring both hopeful and depressing surprises."]},

But that is certainly not the case with this 1925 Italian produced silent film of Rostand's famous play. Sure, doing a silent version of a very talky play like CYRANO DE BERGERAC presents considerable problems for the director. Here, they are partly solved by very frequent, some might think incessant, title cards, presented simultaneously in Spanish and English. The bilingual presentation suggests that the single surviving copy which provided this restoration was probably an export print.", "For the silent era, the acting here is rather restrained, suggesting that maybe the cast were stage trained people. Since I presume almost everyone knows the \"Cyrano\" story, I'll skip over any synopsis attempt, and comment upon what for me was the most intriguing aspect of the film. I refer to the colour process used. It was called the \"Pathe Stencil Process\", and I confess to an imperfect understanding of exactly how it was worked. It appears that individual frames were projected on ground glass slides, hand coloured by artists, and these plates then used to produce the individual \"colour\" frames in the final print. This was a painfully slow process. Witness that the film was started in 1922, and release prints were not available until 1925.", "If you find the editing choppy at times, probably the blame lies on how exhibitors handled the single surviving print when it was in general release. In those days, it was not uncommon for an exhibitor to edit out portions of a film which he did not like, or perhaps to simply shorten the film. See, the shorter the film, the more audiences you could run by it. Anyway, this old film is worth a look. The hand colouring is used mostly on the costumes, sometimes on faces and backgrounds. The idea, perhaps, was to recreate the feeling of old paintings, not real life colour. Note that in the period 1922 to 1925, the 2-strip Technicolor process was under development, and might have been available to the producers for testing or use. In any case, they didn't use it, and we have something unique as a result."]},

Her face is definitely in the top 10 when it comes to porn stars.", "The scenes with Lexus are the best. We get to see her in two different scenes and she gives a great performance in both.

This is one of my favorite scenes where two girls have sex with one guy. In the other scene Lexus has sex with Dallas.

Too bad we didn't get to see Lexus' pretty face covered in cum.", "The only big problem I have with this movie is Sharon Mitchell who plays Debbies(Lexus) mom. She is really annoying in her role and unfortunately we even get to see her have sex. I mean this old slut was already 41 when this was made. Nobody wants to see a 41 year old ho have sex in a mainstream hardcore porno movie. Especially when she's ugly to begin with. There should be a law against women over 40 having sex in mainstream pornos, and this rule should only be broken if the woman is really, really, really hot. They have separate movies with old women for those who like that kind of stuff. Well the good thing is that this scene comes last, so you can turn the movie off when Dallas blows his load on Lexus.", "All in all this is a pretty good porno.

I can understand that but there is no reason to convict somebody without evidence supporting it. So Dunne's life was forever changed by his daughter's murder not for the better because his anger doesn't do anything except destroy his credibility. I know that parents of murdered children do hold this anger for the right reasons but I don't think Dunne has done anything productive except write books criticizing the legal system. I still feel for Dominique who had such a promising future as an actress and the tragic death of hers is an absolute loss to the acting community.

Jack Warden portrays a character with frailty and charm. However, there are just too many familiar clichés in the plot to recommend the picture. Many kids will find it boring and tedious, as will many adults. \"A Dog of Flanders\" has enough spirit and the right attitude, but the rest of the essential elements of a successful movie just are not here."]},

He and Jim, together in the mental hospital and now on the outside together, \"passing ships\" as Charles describes them, are a dyad born of love and remembrance. They share the memory of a former life, a sane and safe place that is surely achievable again. Ripped by psychic and emotional pain, Charles knows he has killed. His bonding with Jim, in a desperate attempt to ameliorate his condition at the eleventh hour, serves as a bridge to redemption, an escape from the pain that rips them both.", "We meet Jim on the road, briefly accompanied by a dimwit killer named Pokey. Jim's brutal isolation does not bury him, for he still seeks to understand those forces to which he can only react; his struggle is to keep the spirit intact. In this quest he finds, in the lunatic Charles, a scarecrow-thin exposed nerve, a symbolic representation of humanity and salvation. Charles is a highwire artist of the human spirit, at war with despair, and the breaking of his mind has not yet forced him to relinquish his soul. But in the midst of comic evil and the brain-numbing reality of environmental pollution and floor wax and bean dip that comprises an artery of False River, this is a time of suffering for Jim and his spiritual compatriot and guide Charles, an ultimate test of survival forged in blood and madness, and survival is less important than restoration of the heart.", "Under its slippery surface, FALSE RIVER is a transformative journey of mythical proportions, ultimately life-affirming. It is played against a backdrop of small-town American reality that is calibrated to stasis and fine-tuned to destruction. The ironic richness of this stark contrast opens possibilities to the viewer that are not readily available in any form, a small gemstone glittering in the sunlight."]},

Of course, these directors were inexperienced and unknown, so their movies never properly received the attention they deserved. Todd Morris' \"A Gun for Jennifer\" is a prototypic example to state this theory. Judging by the story content, the gritty filming style and the excessive amount of graphic violence, it is plain obvious that Morris watched way too many exploitation & trash movies as a kid and then suddenly decided one day to gather together a bunch of friends to shoot his very own and cheap homage to 70's Grindhouse cinema. Well, I can only applaud Todd Morris and everyone else involved in this production, as I could only dream about realizing such a project of my own. Everything about \"A Gun for Jennifer\" is extremely basic and gratuitous - subject material as well as the elaboration - but that doesn't necessarily mean it's bad. Quite the contrary even; a straightforward plot, amateurish acting and clumsy camera-work are almost fundamental characteristics in order to achieve an authentic Grindhouse movie! Todd Morris borrows and even shamelessly copies several elements from older films, notably \"I Spit on your Grave\", Abel Ferrara's \"Ms. 45\" and the virtually unknown \"Rape Squad\". It's about a beautiful young woman who flees from Ohio to New York City, for reasons explained later in the film, and almost immediately becomes the victim of scum rapists. She gets rudely rescued when a van full of tough chicks passes by and kills the rapists without hesitating. The girls apparently all work together in a nightclub and, since they got a little fed up with the endless amount of unsolved rape cases and various other acts of violence against women, they decided to form some sort of vigilante posse and roam the streets at night. Since she has nowhere else to go and because, after all, these women rescued here, the girl  choosing the false Jennifer  joins the gang. She gradually gets sucked more and more into a world of vengeance and violence, but also the fanatic female police detective Perez comes closer to uncovering their identities.", "What we have here, my dear fellow smut & exploitation fanatics (as you are the only ones likely to read the comments for this type of movies), is an almost perfect tribute to politically incorrect early 70's trash! The characters are complete stereotypes (all men are scum, all women are tough mothers), the sleaze-level is extremely high in spite of very little nudity shown on screen, the soundtrack and photography make you feel uncomfortable and the violence is uncompromising to say the least. Although bringing little variety in the killings, \"A Gun for Jennifer\" is literally a bloodbath of a film and particularly the climax goes far over the top in depicting sick and sadistic ferocity. Deborah Twiss, who also co-wrote the screenplay, as well as her girlfriends aren't likely to win any major acting awards in their careers but the have the exact right looks, charisma and tough facials expression for this kind of role. The soundtrack is simply amazing and contains some marvelously apt songs. If you want to know what I'm referring to, just look up Moloko's \"Killa Bunnies\" on YouTube! Purely talking in terms of good cinema, \"A Gun for Jennifer\" probably doesn't deserve a rating any higher than 5 or 6, but I'm generously giving an 8 for sheer respect towards Todd Morris and his crew."]},

Marketed on DVD under Christy Canyon's name by ABA in one of its 3-fer collections, video actually stars Heather Wayne, Amber Lynn and Gail Force as newcomers to L.A. trying to break into show biz. The time-honored theme dates back to exploitation roadshow movies of the 1930s, but Seven adds nothing to the lore except jokes you have to wait for until the end credits (i.e., naming the unscrupulous and horny talent agents of his cast Jim South and William Morris).", "I was appalled at the very sloppy construction of the video, which is more an assemblage of footage than a completed project. I cannot recall either a mainstream (those dreaded \"indies\") or porn effusion slapped together in such cavalier fashion, apart from compilations or loop carriers.", "With no script credit (many scenes are poorly improvised with the cast struggling to think of something to say), there is merely a succession of sex scenes with the most rudimentary of buildups. Basically, the girls visit agents' offices in search of representation and work assignments, and are treated to casting couch action. For the fans, Christy Canyon plays a receptionist who throws in an extra, lesbian style, casting audition of Heather Wayne replete with a dildo.", "When the women finally get work, it is a dubious bondage video helmed by Bruce Seven himself, wearing a Superman t-shirt and reciting his expository lines as if the director (himself) were pointing a gun to his head. The desultory bondage/orgy scene is awful, merely an excuse for lots of humping, cast dressed in bondage gear, and some BDSM lite in the form of whipping. It's there largely to advertise Seven's endless line of S&M videos, many of which improbably remain in print via pointless DVD reissues.", "Height of crappiness and insincerity occurs when Seven as director of film within a film keeps calling Lynn \"Amber\" instead of using the character's name Barbara - he's directing this piece of crap so he should know what he named her!", "The structural mess is embodied by endless cross-cutting, credited to untalented editors Loretta Sterling (executive producer of this farrago and male to boot) and Dave Quick, between sex scenes. Forget about real-time (or story chronology), a sex scene here (such as boss Peter North humping receptionist Christy Canyon) will pop up as continuation an hour later in the video, almost randomly. Charting the edits would be easy, but watching the result is tiresome in the extreme - a forerunner of the meretricious Christopher Nolan syndrome of modern times.", "Certainly fans of Gail, Heather and Christy will be pleased to see their favorites in action, but each has scores of far better performances to watch. Most of the feature is dominated by its lively library music soundtrack, to which the generic sex footage is superimposed. I especially enjoyed listening (for the umpteenth time) to porn covers of Sade's \"Smooth Operator\" and the Harold Faltermeyer \"Beverly Hills Cop\" background music, both very fresh back in 1984/85 when this stinker was produced. Random posters as office backdrop to sex scenes range from Hal Ashby's \"Being There\" to a vintage one-sheet for the Rick Cassidy vehicle \"The California Connection\"."]},

Director/adapter William Cartlidge has treated Wilde's original with such reverence that he seems to have completely ignored the needs of a cinematic audience. Thankfully the quality of the direction and editing improves significantly after the first half hour, but by then the damage has been done. Of the actors, Prunella Scales and Robert Hardy wipe the floor with the rest of the cast every time they are on screen. The other exceptions are Jonathan Firth's Arthur and Karen Hayley's Mabel, who are given enough latitude to deliver their lines with the true comic sense which Wilde intended. The ostensible leads, James Wilby and Trevyn McDowell, are in comparison lacklustre and wooden. In an obvious attempt to eke every penny out a meagre budget, the play has been nominally updated to the 1990's, but in conjunction with the original script the effect is more of a badly script 1970s TV drama. True moments of comedy are few and far between, but when they arrive are highly amusing - a sign, maybe, that more judicious pruning of the rest of the play might have led to a better paced, more even film."]},

Call it schizophrenia, delusional disorder or narcissistic personality. She embodies all three. Not only did she not apologize for being guilty of excessive greed and sloth, she had no clue why she was being accused of these. The writer did a good job of highlighting the crimes the Marcos family has committed over several decades and showed the current influence Imelda holds over contemporary Philipino culture. For a brief past/present glimpse of the Marcos family and their crimes against humanity and extortion, this documentary shows concrete examples. And you get a glimpse firsthand of just how delusional and completely clueless Imelda Marcos is. While her country starves, she accumulates jewelry. Though she is not different than other leaders of 3rd world countries, it shows the American hand in creating the monster that is her ultimate excessive greed, which she refers to as surrounding herself with \"beauty\". I laughed throughout the entire film at the endless contradictions. Overall, well done and unbiased."]},

Unfortunately, as with so many book-to-film translations, the poetry of the prose and thus some of the deeper meanings are lost. Some of the changes between the film and the book work effectively to condense dozens of pages into one idea (the \"wall of baby pictures\" in the jail helps quickly convey Alice's changing relationship with her unit mates), but other changes only serve to hammer home a point that was made with much more subtlety in the book. (Did we really need angry graffiti on the side of the Goodwin's house? WE GET IT -- the town didn't like them!) Pat Metheny's original soundtrack was beautifully melodic, as he usually is, but it didn't fit in with the feel of the movie, and surprisingly, it didn't have much of the Midwest sensibilities one would expect from a composer from Missouri. Nonetheless, this movie will at least be worth a video rental, especially if you are a Sigourney Weaver fan and want to see her doing something other than an _Alien_ pic.

Local poacher Jonas Rigg (Robert Brown) has an important clue to the killer, but is himself poisoned before he can talk. And Margaret's time is running out...", "Based on Gerald Verner's book of the same name, which in turn was the novelisation of his radio serial, it's no great surprise to find this, like so many other British films of its type, has an abundance of dialogue. There are also very few exterior shots, but it is gripping, with a considerable amount of tension. It's an archetypal 'whodunit' with a host of characters whom act in a suspicious manner or have some dark secret. There's the time-honoured gathering of all the suspects in a locked room: \"One of you is the murderer\". It's done with considerable power and effect though. Dennis Price, in the period after he had ceased to be a major star and before becoming a much admired character actor is good in the lead, as is Rona Anderson, who will always have a special place in the hearts of fans of British B movies of the era. Veteran character actress Esma Cannon is spiteful spinster Miss Ginch and popular opera singer Ian Wallace pops up in a small role as the pub landlord. Hardly seen since its original release, it's certainly worth watching, so well done to those DVD companies who are giving these modest but enjoyable films a new lease of life."]},

I was especially pleased to see Wylde get a big, big role, humping everyone in sight, showing off her spectacular nipple cones and waist length hair, and being positively bubbly in comedy scenes. Taylor is quite effective as well, and Canyon equals Wylde in the bubbly department but is so infrequently on screen one wonders whether she was added to the mix as an afterthought since having just 2 actresses would be considered chintzy.", "Inexperienced as director (this may have been his first such effort), though one of porn's acting icons, Edwards does have trouble balancing the varying moods and attitudes of the script, almost killing the feature at one point. Random, in a faultless bit of acting, turns dark in one scene and begins physically abusing Wylde. Though later his slapping her is totally fake, at first the tone changes to that of a dark \"roughie\" and it takes awhile for the movie to get back on its feet again. Later roughie content is tongue-in-cheek, as the gals tie up Bullock to a wall and gag him (to cool his heels for a whole weekend) as punishment, and force him to watch their lesbian tryst (not really punishment)."]},

It never strays far from the conventions of Imperial fiction of the \"Boy's Own Paper\"/\"Ripping Yarns\" type. Only the prominence of the 'love interest' shows that it was intended for an adult audience. ", "A predictable 'love triangle' plot is combined with 'trouble on the frontier'. The three central characters are European. Jean Stuart, a nursing sister, finds herself caught between two men. Captain Peter Allison is a brave and upright young District Officer in the Colonial Service, who, we are told, has left behind the comforts of home in order to bring \"White Man's justice\" to Africa. Mark Fernandez is the brutal and cynical manager of a failing tin mine, who corrupts the locals with alcohol. Captain Allison knows his rival for what he is (a thoroughly bad sort), but Jean tries to see good in everyone and hopes to reform the villain with kindly exhortations to \"play the game\". ", "The Nigerians in the background are generally depicted as credulous, superstitious, and easily roused to violence. The film was made on location in Africa, and some outdoor scenes are in semi-documentary style. To modern eyes, the acting of the Africans is actually more acceptable (since more naturalistic) than the acting of the British professionals. ", "\"Palaver\" is by no means a badly made film for its day, and it does possess historical interest, if only on account of its plentiful stock of Imperial stereotypes. Captain Allison displays a sangfroid to match that of Sir Francis Drake on Plymouth Hoe (or Sir Sidney Ruff-Diamond in \"Carry On Up the Khyber\"). What is his response to the news that the natives are revolting? \"They will have to wait till I've finished shaving!\""]},

If you like long drawn out schmaltzy romances with Demi as the romantic heroine, you will love this film times two.  Otherwise, hide any weapons lest you begin attacking your screen.", "This film was toasted by the critics, but I didn't think it was that bad. In fact, I liked it.  I guess I fall more into the first (sucker for schmaltz) category.  The story was criticized as being a contrived version of `Me, Myself and I', where a woman is torn over the choice between life as a professional and the family shtick.  That criticism really misses the point.  This is a story about a woman's psychological attempt to deal with her traumatic past and has nothing whatever to do with lifestyle choices.", "I found this to be an intelligent and complex character study of a woman who seems to be two people living two lives, but really isn't.  If that seems cryptic, see the film and it might become clearer.  When she goes to sleep from her life with her children in France, she wakes up to her high-powered career in New York and vice versa.  She can't determine which is real and which is a fantasy.  She has a lover in each life and both seem very real to her.  As the story unfolds, she and we try to figure out which is her real life and which is the dream.", "The trouble with the presentation is that its real intrigue lies with the psychodrama.  Unfortunately, neophyte director Alain Berliner pushed that element to the background and cranked up the schmaltz machine, centering the story on the romances instead.  That wouldn't have been so bad if they weren't so interminable.  Scene after scene retraced the same romantic theme, until it became frayed.  ", "Other than the misplaced emphasis, the film was well crafted.  There were subtle hints throughout about which was the real life, but they were far from obvious tip-offs.  However, when we finally discover the truth, it takes forever to wrap up the loose ends.  To Berliner's credit, the locations were breathtaking, in both France and New York.  It is easy to find beauty in the French countryside, but these were some of the most wonderful film perspectives I have ever seen of New York's skyline and street vistas.", "After enjoying a few years as one of the highest paid entertainers on the planet, Demi Moore disappeared for three years.  This was probably not the best vehicle for her return.  Her performance was strongly emotional but one-dimensional, failing to differentiate the characters sufficiently.  She played the high-powered NYC girl to be just as wimpy as the insecure girl in France.  To be fair however, she created two very appealing and vulnerable romantic characters and deserved better notices than she received.", "William Fichtner was not the greatest choice for her NY love interest. Fichtner is better at abrasive antagonist roles and his attempts at sensitivity came across as far too pathetic.  Stellan Skarsgard was much better and made a dashing and attractive romantic figure.", "This was a good story that took a sentimental detour under the guidance of an inexperienced director.  Still, it was engrossing and even touching at times.  I rated it a 7/10.  Add a point if you like sentimental pieces and subtract at least two if you aren't a Demi Moore fan."]},

Todd Bonin and Jim Vines from a story by Mark Castaldo and directed by Doug Campbell who also was co-writer. So many guys involved with this and what a mess they all turned out. Won't belabor the story but it's all about deception. In this case a nice all-American good looking young man who rents the guest cottage from a lovely young thing who lives with her father and daughter in the big house. The rest is all suspense, or supposed to be. Linda Purl, as the woman of the house, is not the best of actresses. She was also slow on getting what was going on around her. Why is it the heroine is always brain dead? And then in the end she suddenly gets all this courage and intelligence to do our villain in? Maxwell Caufield, as the young man who moved in, was very good as the villain. I was hoping he'd get away with the crime with all the stupidity around him. Stacy Hogue as the daughter had a few moments, but only a few. She spent most of the time spying on our villain until she finally got the message but too late. Oh, well. Tracy Nelson, Ricky's daughter, I've seen before in something where she was psychotic, but not sure what. She did the most stupid thing by escaping, not outside and she could have, but upstairs where she could get caught. Another stupid mistake. Oh, and the boy friend to Stacy, makes the most stupid mistake. When he's spotted by the killer in the woods, and gets the chance to escape, he grabs the gun and chases him till he's out of bullets. Another stupid character and choice. Melissa Behr plays an interesting role convincingly. However, at first you think she's on our side until she begins to get in trances, one after another. And finally there's Earl Holliman, who's body of work is amazing. His work is respected by many (GIANT, RAINMAKER) but what a waste of that talent in this.

His bullish colleague Amadieu (Henri Vilbert) is certain that the workers who transported the wardrobe are the killers but Maigret is unconvinced especially as corpses begin to pile up. Who is this mysterious killer who sends the police anonymous letters signed only Picpus?", "Albert Préjean stars as Maigret in this wartime Continental Films take on the famous Georges Simenon character. He is a terrific leading man, cool, charming, witty, and stoic, displaying all the qualities that made such Hollywood actors as Humphrey Bogart, Gary Cooper and William Holden stars. Of course, his portrayal of the commissaire is about as far from the heavy-set, taciturn man described by Simenon as possible, but it works within the confines of this film.", "Indeed, the whole movie seems to owe more to American noir than anything written by Simenon. There's little trace of the sombre atmosphere and the psychological analyses that are the chief characteristics of the Maigret novels. Instead, \"Picpus\", as directed by Richard Pottier, fills its runtime with numerous twists, pretty girls, and even a climactic fight scene which impressed me with its realistic and brutal nature. Maigret develops a fondness for the sexy private detective by the name of Berthe (Juliette Faber) but is she truly an ally or is she a femme fatale. No prizes for those who guess correctly.", "The novel is adapted for the screen by Jean-Paul Le Chanois and the screenplay's a mess. To be honest, I'm not a fan of the original novel, translated as \"To Any Lengths\" either, with its preposterous plot and cartoonish characters, but Le Chanois' adaptation takes all those flaws and enhances them by adding a whole host of needless characters, blind allies, and red herrings. By the end, he has tied himself up in so many knots, that he doesn't even bother to explain everything forgetting several major subplots along the way. The body count balloons from two to seven, and the final explanation doesn't make much sense seeing how it relies on a series of highly improbable coincidences.", "But, for all the shortcomings of the plot, \"Picpus\" actually works as a fairly entertaining and well-made thriller. This is mostly down to its solid cast, led by the highly likeable Préjean, and reliable direction from Richard Pottier. He does a great job of mimicking Hollywood thrillers with their noirish atmosphere and off-beat cinematography inspired by German expressionism. There are several great scenes set in front of an enormous map of Paris equipped with lightbulbs that shine whenever a crime is reported on a certain street. I was also impressed by Pottier's brief but imaginative use of split-screen in the scene in which Maigret first learns of the crime.", "Even Le Chanois' script, when it isn't too busy trying to untangle its Gordian plot, delivers several memorable scenes. As a fan of the Maigret novels, I enjoyed how it picks apart the commissaire's unusual methods and brings them into conflict with his colleagues' standard operating procedure. \"Maigret's methods may be fanciful, but they work,\" says his boss (Antoine Balpêtré) only to later revert his opinion. \"Intuition has never brought us anywhere\". In a rare moment of poetic introspection, Maigret describes his intuition as his geometry in which \"the triangles and circles are alive. They have hearts and heads. Must be understood. The shortest way from one point to another isn't always a straight line.\"", "There's plenty of humour in \"Picpus\" as well, mostly in the form of Maigret's bumbling, overweight assistant Lucas (André Gabriello). He's no one's idea of refined comedy, but he's also not as grating as most comic relief characters are. He's no Stepin Fetchit, that's for sure. I enjoyed the subtler comedic moments more, for sure, like the third-act sequence in which Maigret goes looking for a suspect at a Native American-themed dinner, or the running gag about slippery parquette. The comedy in \"Picpus\" is not its greatest strength but it also isn't obnoxious or distracting the way it is in some thrillers from the same period.", "In conclusion, \"Picpus\" is very far removed from Simenon's creation but as a French take on film noir, it is a decent, entertaining effort. I especially enjoyed Préjean's performance and the moody cinematography. It isn't the kind of film to satisfy your need for psychological thrillers and profound characterisation, but it will scratch that rainy-day itch quite nicely."]},

Where are the likable characters? In every life, there are some, and films demand at least one or two. In this film, all the adults are mean or obtuse, oblivious to anyone but themselves. Whaley gave us stereotypes and the actors weren't challenged beyond them. John Leguizamo's character is a bright spot, but realism is blown by him not taking the kid's age into account. In real life he wouldnta talked to him like a balling, boozing buddy, the kid looks to be only 12 or so. Ethan Hawke could have made a difference if he had put in a little effort... showing his sandaled feet bypasses character development, implying warmth and understanding, but the gimmick is wasted by the flatness of his character. His not knowing what \"pithy\" means blows his credibility as an educated man in a position of power in a school. Gimme a break!", "Some scenes are heavy-handed, some merely sketched. (And what is the deal with Kilmer's mega-elbow?? It is framed for viewing, so why?) The level of back talk and profanity is also wrong for the era.

The title is not explained, and there is nothing at all to suggest why Joe is a King. His peeing in the food makes scant sense when he doesn't even tell his brother about it to ease his suffering. ", "Music could have been a saving grace, but it is barely explored. This is a depressing film that may have exorcised somebody's demons, at least I hope it did.

There are only 11 survivors, among them are pilot Carolyn Fry (Who has assumed command after the ship's captain is killed), bounty hunter William J. Johns, religious man Abu Al-Walid, Antiques dealer Paris P. Ogilvie, runaway teenager Jack, settlers John 'Zeke' Ezekiel and his lover Sharon 'Shazza' Montgomery, and Richard B. Riddick, a dangerous escaped convict. Marooned, the survivors discover the barren and hot desert-scape has sunlight from three suns. Not only must they find food and water and worry about Riddick, the survivors find themselves being hunted by the planet's flesh-eating inhabitants when the planet is engulfed in darkness, which happens every 22 years, as they emerge from underground to hunt and eat all signs of life. Fry and the survivors find Riddick is their best chance of survival, as Riddick has surgically-enhanced eyes that allow him to see in the dark as they set out to find a way of escaping from the planet and getting to an escape shuttle, before they all get eaten by the creatures on the surface.", "When the transport ship \"Hunter-Gratzner\" is hit by a meteor shower, the pilot Carolyn Fry is awaken from the cryogenic sleep and tries to control the vessel with forty passengers. She is forced to release a module and only Carolyn; the bounty hunter William J. Johns; the religious Abu \"Imam\" al-Walid; the dealer Paris P. Ogilvie; Sharon 'Shazza' Montgomery; the runaway teenager Jack; John 'Zeke' Ezekiel; Suleiman; Hassan); Ali; and the dangerous criminal Richard B. Riddick survive. Riddick escapes and Johns scares the survivors telling how dangerous he is. The group is stranded in the desert and find that place is heated by three suns and they team-up to seek for water and supplies. Soon they discover that there are under siege of flesh eating aliens that attack in the darkness; further, the planet will be pitch black with a total eclipse. They conclude that it is not with Riddick that they have to be worried about.", "Set in the distant future, a spaceship carrying some 40 people, mostly ones wanting to settle on other planets from their own, hits a meteor shower and crash lands on a distant planet killing all but twelve of them. The survivors, led by the second-in-command Carolyn Fry ('Rahda Mitchell' ), find themselves on a hot and arid landscape with constant sunlight from three orbiting suns. Fry not only must help the survivors find food and water, but contend with a deadly criminal, named Riddick (", "), who was being transported to a prison cell on their destination. But every 22 years, the planet's three suns go into a total eclipse for a month where darkness brings out the planet's real inhabitants; large, reptilian, vampire-like creatures that come out and dominate the surface in total darkness, killing and eating all life. The Fry and her people then must cooperate with Riddick, who has surgically enhanced eyes to see in darkness, to lead them to safety and off the planet before they all become dinner for the creatures.", "It's in the distant future (when people traveling to outer space is a thing) and in another part of the galaxy away from earth. The space transport ship \"Hunter-Gratzner\" is sailing in its designated lane (marked by stars), carrying about 40 people on board. As is the norm during space travel, all the people are in cryo-sleep (suspended animation); all except one Riddick who exceptionally is awake. Twenty-two weeks into its journey and several weeks away from the next stop, accident strikes, as debris from possibly a rogue comet or a meteor storm hits the ship and pierces the ship's hull. It wakes up the crew, kills the captain, and the ship is knocked into the atmosphere of a nearby planet, thus kicking in gravity. The ship is now descending to the planet's surface at extreme speed and Docking pilot Carolyn Fry (", ") with navigator Greg Owens (", ") tries to take control. Owen tries to send a distress signal, but the communication antenna is damaged (apparently burning in the friction at the upper atmosphere). Fry tries to control the descent by jettisoning the aft section, which puts the ship into a roll, as it enters the cloud strata of the planet. She deploys air-brakes, and the ship stabilizes from the roll, but still, the rear-heavy ship is descending tail-first, so she begins purging the aft sections sequentially. Owen sees the door behind him close and realizes she intends to jettison the passenger cabin as well and stops her by blocking the airlock. With barely a minute to go, Fry sees the horizon as the ship finally levels. The overloaded air-brakes fail and break the windscreen, and Fry faces the force of air as the ship paces ahead. The ship finally makes a sliding crash landing on the planet, partly guided by the automated program in the ship which has chosen a place to hit that has some oxygen. The impact has broken open the main cabin, scattering objects outside, all along the long trail of impact.", "There are about 11 survivors of the crash: Carolyn Fry; William J. Johns (", "), who appears to be a cop from his badge; a Muslim \"Imam\" Abu al-Walid (", ") and three young Muslim boys (Ali, Hassan, Suleiman) he is escorting on hajj (a religious pilgrimage) to the planet New Mecca; antique dealer Paris P. Ogilvie (", "); stowaway teenager Jack (", ") who has run away from his parents; settlers John 'Zeke' Ezekiel (", ") and his partner Sharon 'Shazza' Montgomery (", "); and Richard B. Riddick (", "), a dangerous \"criminal\", murderer and feared monster, with unusual eyes- he can see in the dark but is hurt by daylight, so he wears protective goggles in the daytime.", "As the dust settles, Fry finds Owens is impaled by a metal shaft. She seeks painkillers from the back, but the back of the cabin is gone. With Owens in terrible pain, Fry orders everyone out of the ship, and alone attends to him as he dies. Riddick has partially got free in the chaos but is quickly arrested by Johns. Riddick is blindfolded, chained, and tied inside the ship, while the rest of the survivors come out of the shipwreck and look around.", "They find that the planet is a barren and bright hot desert-scape. In the distance is a low hill, spiked with many spires (chimney-like structures tapering to the top). The compass needle sways rudderlessly, so there is no sense of direction. They can breathe in its air, though breathing is difficult. As Fry joins them outside, they thank her as \"captain\" for saving their lives from a hopeless situation, but she is unsure having tried to sacrifice them earlier. Some 50 meters away from the main cabin of the wreck-ship, lies the Cargo Hold cabin, where Paris finds his bottles of luxury wine, but they have no water. Imam gives hope- \"All deserts have water. It only waits to be found\".", "Meanwhile, Riddick sitting tied at hands, legs, eyes, and mouth, escapes using his extraordinary skills bending his shoulders. There is extreme fear about Riddick among the rest of the survivors, due to his notorious past. Johns has them all pick some weapon from the shipwreck (including some antique weapons of Paris), with the message- Riddick would come back to get things of need, so be ready to kill him or be killed by him. Jack is an exception, as he admires Riddick to the point of idolizing him.", "Outside the shipwreck, Zeke, Sazza, and Jack make a breather aid, to push oxygen intake on need. Johns scans the horizon with his telescope looking for Riddick. It seems to be late afternoon and sunset would happen soon, so Fry asks Imam to get on searching for water while it's cool enough and before nightfall. That's when they see something stunning in the horizon- there are three suns, promising everlasting daylight! A yellowish pair of suns very close to each other are setting, while a blueish sun is rising in the opposite direction. With no nightfall, they should be able to continue searching- for Riddick and water. Imam takes the blue sunrise as the direction from God to search the blue water. Johns is happy that Riddick won't have the advantage of the dark and takes the blue sunrise as the direction to search Riddick (who being comfortable in darkness would have gone opposite of sunset direction). Johns has half the group (Sazza, Paris, Jack, and Zeke with a gun) keep vigil at the wreck-ship, warning them to shoot Riddick at sight, otherwise, there would be a few silent kills, apparently by Riddick's knife skills.", "The remaining group (Imam, his 3 Muslim boys, Fry, and Johns with his gun) sets off searching, in/towards the blue sunlight (as the other two suns have set). Johns finds \"trees\" in his telescope and that means water. However, on reaching there, they see it's a huge bone structure, lying along a long channel of giant skeletons of animals. They think it's a mass graveyard/boneyard and wonder- is this whole planet dead and who killed them all?", "The dying Owens had uttered \"Don't touch that handle\" to Fry, apparently referring to the rod piercing his chest, but subconsciously repeating his earlier words to her when she pulled the handle to drop the passenger cabin. Johns, who had picked up this hint, now finds Fry alone near the skeleton's shade and confirms with her that she indeed tried to sacrifice the passengers, with the promise that he won't tell anyone. However they are not alone; hiding behind in the shade is Riddick, with his shiv (knife) made of bone. Through their conversation, Riddick has silently cut away, contrary to the monster image of his, a piece of her hair.", "Leaving the boneyard, the group continues scouting and walks through a narrow canyon that has many spires at the ridge-tops and a rib cage skeleton making an archway over the path. Near the end of the canyon they begin to find manmade objects like a solar toy robot, and soon reach a complete human settlement, long abandoned. They find water-related items like jugs, moisture-recovery machine, tap, and conclude- there was once water here.", "Fry finds a dark room that has an orrery, a mechanical model that shows the motion of the planets around their sun(s). She tries a voice command to switch on the lights but gets no response, so she opens the windows to let sunlight in, and the solar-powered orrery starts running. The model shows that there are 3 suns (two yellowish ones close-by and another bluish one away) and three planets between them. One of the end planets has a Saturn-like ring and the middle planet apparently is the one where they have landed. Having suns on either side, the planets should get everlasting sunlight, which explains why the rooms don't have any light bulbs. The model has the option to set the year which arranges the orbits accordingly. As she exits, she finds to her utter delight, a skiff (small spaceship) at the back of the settlement.", "Back at the wreck-ship, Paris, Sazza, and Jack are near the containers, and Zeke is a watchable distance away near the hill, digging a mass grave, all at the same time nervously watching out for Riddick. They mistakenly shoot an unknown man who looked like Riddick, but he was just a survivor of the crash. Zeke's dug grave is amongst a group of spires and when he brings the bodies there to be buried, he sees a hole in the grave. He inspects the hole and is dragged inside by some unseen force and killed, despite firing his guns. Shazza runs to the place and finds blood everywhere. Also, sitting there is Riddick, knife in hand. As Riddick runs off, Shazza takes him to be Zeke's murderer and they chase him. Johns had heard the gunshot while inspecting the skiff-ship with Fry and had come back. The fleeing Riddick is intercepted by Johns who fights him, tearing off his protective goggles, blinding him with the sun, and he is re-chained in the shipwreck.", "Fry questions the chained Riddick, who sarcastically confesses, repeating the exaggerated stories about him being whispered around the group who are so fearful of him. When Fry still probes, he replies he is no longer the group's biggest problem, hinting that some unknown creatures killed Zeke and the body may be deeper inside the hole. Fry notices his peculiar shiny eyes and the fanboy Jack asks how he can see at night. Riddick points to his past where he was kept in prison for years away from daylight and a surgical job which led to those changes. Though Johns warns that Riddick is lying (that something else killed Zeke), Fry begins to believe Riddick and decides to investigate the hole. Tethered by a safety wire to the outside, Fry enters deep inside the tunnel where Zeke disappeared and finds his severed ankle and boot. She sees several conical openings to the top through which sunlight beams into the cave- those are apparently the inside of the spires they have seen from outside, and the home of the alien inhabitants of the planet. As she finds the aliens lurking there in the shade and making strange sounds, she freaks out screaming and somehow escapes into another hole, helped by the group outside.", "Having found bigger problems to handle, Johns unchains Riddick to fight for survival, promising him freedom and under the condition that he won't carry his shiv (knife). The group packs up some belongings and a power cell from the wreck-ship (to test the skiff-ship) and heads to the settlement, a big load on a metal sled being dragged along by Riddick, now part of the group. At the settlement, they try to repair the skiff-ship. Though Paris observes it's very old, Fry thinks if they can adapt its old electrical system to theirs, it will work. Sazza observes it's low capacity (two-seater) and probably cannot go far, but Riddick says even this two-seater can take them to the solar-track shipping lanes from where they can be rescued. Johns stops Riddick from going inside the skiff-ship and diverts him to find materials to repair the wings. Fry manages to power on the skiff-ship for a system check. She calculates they will need five power cells to launch the skiff-ship, as it needs 90 Gig power and each cell is of 20 Gig. They need to fetch four more cells from the wreck-ship, each cell being 35 kg. There is a solar-powered sandcat vehicle at the settlement, which Shazza repairs so as to carry the heavy load.", "Elsewhere in the settlement, the moisture machine has been repaired and Imam and his boys are overjoyed as water drops from the tap there. Jack has found a shaving tool, shaves his head and dons a pair of goggles in emulation of his idol Riddick. Riddick explores around and finds one Coring Room which strangely is chain-locked from the inside. Jack along with a Muslim boy Ali playfully followed him there, Jack hiding on top of the room and Ali sneaking inside the room. Riddick and Jack come back from there as the group is having a \"party\", apparently celebrating the newfound water. At the gathering, the group discusses the many items left behind at the settlement. They reckon that its former residents were geologists, but wonder why they left the planet and left behind those many items, including the skiff-ship. While Others try to rationalize, Fry doubts and Riddick states baldly that the former occupants are all dead, and by the same creatures who killed Zeke.", "All this while Ali is still in the nearly dark Coring room, which unfortunately has Alien birds nesting near its ceiling. Riddick had unknowingly uncovered the solar equipment at its roof and slowly an automatic shutter opens, leading sunlight in. As light falls on the nest, hundreds of bat-like Alien birds (apparently young, not fully grown ones) fly around screeching. Ali in panic runs into another dark room inside, as do the birds. Hearing his screams, the others come and break open the Coring room. When they open its inner room, the flock of flying creatures comes out and quickly fly down into the coring shaft, apparently avoiding light in the room. They find and bury the boy's body. They throw a flare light down into the coring shaft to see what's in there and find a huge number of human skulls and skeletons. Riddick explains- the geologists had hid there thinking it to be safe but were killed by the flying aliens through some gaps. Shazza offers Riddick her breather, trying to apologize for thinking he killed Zeke.", "Fry finds a coring sample dated 22 years ago, of the same month as now. She returns to the planets model and flips through the year setting. They realize that every 22 years there is a total eclipse, as all the 3 planets and the suns on either side align, thus plunging the middle planet into complete darkness. Not only that, the 3 planets then move as one for some time, thus the eclipse should last for a prolonged period of days or months.", "Fry and others rush on their plan to bring the power cells from the wreck-ship to the skiff-ship, repair the wings and fly out of the planet, all in time before darkness falls (though nobody knows exactly when that will happen). Johns warns against that, telling Fry that Riddick escaped the last time by flying a ship and killing the pilot, so they must not fetch the power cells to the skiff-ship until the last minute, lest Riddick does it again. Fry is rather happy that in Riddick they have another person to pilot a spaceship. Soon Riddick gets Fry alone inside the skiff-ship and contrary to her fear and imagination, rather gives his version of things- his promised freedom, that Johns is not a cop but a bounty hunter, and hints about Johns' drug problem.", "Fry confronts Johns about the new finding about him and he admits he isn't a cop. She finds Johns shooting morphine into his eyeball and has a stash of morphine and is angry that he didn't give those painkillers when Owen was dying painfully. She wonders what else is Johns hiding and whether he can be trusted to decide the actions for the group. He shows her the wounds he received from Riddick and asserts that how he takes care of himself, drugs or not, is none of her business and she should rather look to herself (hinting at how selfish she was during the crash and she is hiding it and deciding the actions of the group who now think her as the captain).", "They come out to see that the yellow suns have risen (the blue sun apparently has set), but also, the ring of the other planet appears on the horizon and the massive planet is about to eclipse all sunlight. They hurriedly ride the sandcat vehicle back from the settlement through the canyon back to the wreck-ship and load the power cells on the sled to be dragged. Darkness falls rather quickly, rendering the solar-powered vehicle useless before they could go back to skiff-ship. The rings of the planet cover one sun, then the other sun, and finally the body of the planet covers both suns, thus transitioning from gloomy sunlight to twilight to pitch black. In the twilight, they hear a growing squealing sound from the spires and soon see thousands of mid-sized young aliens flying up into the sky. The men flee to the shelter of the cargo hold cabin (as the main cabin is half open), but Shazza and Riddick fall behind and have to drop to the ground as a torrent of flying creatures passes over. Shazza panics and tries to make a run for it, but is quickly torn into pieces and then carried off in the air. Riddick survives by laying low until the flock flies off. Riddick now removes his goggles and watches in his eyes the distant darkness as the spires break and fully grown alien birds emerge.", "As they explore inside the cargo hold, which has now become a prison for them, the aliens' sound and wall-piercing blades drive them further and further in. Riddick finds a big alien eating a smaller one in the dark corner of the room, which is when Hassan stumbles in there and both try to stand still, hiding. But when multiple big aliens sit close by and bring out their scythe blades from near their sharp claws, Hassan runs in fear and is killed. Riddick runs off towards the rest of the group who put lights that way and Riddick howls away from the light in his face, and so does the alien behind him. Johns shoots down an alien, and they see that light actually burns their flesh which explains the creatures' light aversion. The creature has vertical curved bone blades on the skull, a mouth with teeth for eating and probably smelling, two long horizontal bone ears, a fleshy body, bird-like claws, scythe-blades that emerge from its sole, wings supporting limited flight, and has no eyes (consistent with the nature of their totally dark environment). It locates an object by sending sound through mouth, receiving the echo through the ears, and imaging the sound.", "Johns thinks the darkness should be over soon, but Imam reminds: the planets in the model were moving as one during the eclipse, so there would be a lasting darkness. Fry wants to stick to the plan-- move with the cells to the skiff-ship and fly off this planet. Since the aliens fear the light, Fry suggests they use light as cover while moving in the dark. Johns calls that a mass suicide and would rather wait for the suns to rise again, but Fry points out that strategy did not work for the geologists hiding in the coring shaft. Fry and Johns' argument ends in heated and hateful barbs at each other. The rest of the group takes her as captain to be followed, but who can find the correct path in the dark (even though they have seen the path: wreck-ship to open-ground to the boneyard to the canyon to skiff-ship)? Suddenly Riddick is their means of survival- Fry decides Riddick would lead them with his night vision. They move to the main cabin of the wreck-ship, ready the sled with the 4 cells, and bring as much light as possible, including flares, cutting torch, bottles of inflammable spirit, and glow tubes connected to a central machine. Riddick cautions them: avoid bloody cuts as the aliens have an acute sense of smell for the blood. Jack is particularly alarmed at this, the reason for which is revealed later. Finally, they head out in the dark, Riddick leading them with a flashlight at his back and darkness in his front, and... several alien creatures following them and keeping in the shadows away from the light.", "Paris drops a flashlight and Jack leaves the sled to get it, sparking an alien attack. Jack is saved, but Paris panics and crawls away, breaking the entire glow tube system and quickly his lights go out and he is stabbed by an alien. As he puts to flame his last sip of wine, the terrifying sight of surrounding aliens flashes for a moment. The aliens hungrily feast on him in the dark, watched on by Riddick, who then notices that Jack is a preferred target of those creatures. They continue walking with flares and other lights, but the road seems endless. They find that they have crossed their own tracks, and angrily ask where Riddick is taking them in the dark. Riddick replies he took an extra round as he needed time to think because a death row in the form of the canyon is ahead and because \"the girl\" is bleeding. The group is stunned to discover that \"Jack\" is a girl masquerading as a boy to protect herself and is \"bleeding\". Their earlier passage through the canyon had shown the walls to be full of spires at the top, implying a den of the alien predators, so a bloody girl there with nowhere to escape should be a death row, given the aliens' sense for blood. Fry now realizes the mortal danger they are in now and ahead, with the destination a couple of hundred meters away, and says they should go back to the ship. Johns slaps away her suggestion, recalling her earlier remarks and revealing to the rest her attempts to sacrifice the passenger cabin. The light moves forward- to the skiff-ship.", "They now move into the boneyard, with Johns and Riddick walking ahead of the rest. To survive the canyon ahead, Johns proposes \"sacrifice one to save many\": let Riddick kill \"Jack\", to be dragged some feet behind the sled, as a bloody bait for the aliens. Riddick is angry at his thought process and fights Johns aiming to kill him. Fry (who had already been suspicious and kept more distance) and others run back in panic, as the fight continues. Riddick cuts John's back with his knife, then merges into darkness as Johns' light on the floor goes out. Johns readies his gun while his bleeding wounds and movement draw aliens, and his gun fails him as he is stabbed by an alien and eaten. Riddick rejoins the group who are running back to the wreck-ship (but without direction thus burning up their light) and refocuses them to walk towards the skiff-ship. When they mourn hearing Johns' death, Riddick slams that, hinting at the kind of thoughts reciprocated for them by Johns.", "In the boneyard, Riddick finds an alien predator's skeleton, studies its strengths and weaknesses, and realizes the alien has a blind spot at the center, in between its two bone ears. Then Imam joins him and preaches about believing in God, and Riddick hints at his tortured life in the past, which is why he believes in God... and absolutely hates Him.", "About to enter the canyon, they see it's indeed a death row with a narrow path, and high walls filled with aliens and their sounds all around. As they hesitate, Riddick asks them to see only one way, the way to go off this planet. Riddick takes the power cells, either as a desperate life-saving strategy to enable others to run fast, or as a plan to fly off the planet alone as Johns predicted. Riddick puts on his goggles- either he expects the light in his face as the others should run faster, or he does not want to see the dangers of the dark but only the way out. Finally, all of them run for their lives through the canyon, with Riddick dragging alone the 4 power cells tied together and keeping pace with the others. As they run, a torrent of mid-sized aliens come flying towards them and quickly go over due to the lights. Now they see aliens fighting each other overhead in midair, apparently showing cannibalism from years of hunger. Dead and half-dead aliens and their blue fluid drops down on the ground and they try to run through them. The last Muslim boy gets a bloody leg as one of the fallen aliens grabs his foot. Riddick keeps walking as if he is abandoning them, but \"Jack\" is attacked by an alien and Riddick turns back to fight the alien hand to hand (apparently blocking its scythe blade at the feet), cuts its flesh with his knife, and finally kills it.", "Suddenly it starts to rain, perhaps indicating the cycle of life in the planet- years of heat followed by night's cool and rains of water. The rain threatens what little light they have left. As they look for cover, the last boy pilgrim is snatched by the aliens. Riddick finds a cave for them to hide in, and sends Fry, \"Jack\" and the Imam inside, but then closes the opening, himself moving on.", "\"Jack\" worries that Riddick is leaving them since he has the power cells and the skiff-ship just after the canyon. Soon all their light goes out in the cave, and they find glowing slugs on the cave walls, and fill their empty bottles with those to make lamps. Fry leaves the cave with a lamp and heads for the skiff-ship. Riddick is there on the pilot seat, preparing to launch, leaving the rest to their fate. He opens the door for her, and she invites him to go back together to bring Imam and \"Jack\" back. Riddick, instead, persuades her to get on the skiff-ship and leave with him, abandoning the rest. She cries, with visions of the passengers on the ship during the crash flashing in her mind. She attacks Riddick and insists they go back for \"Jack\" and the Imam. He holds a knife to her neck and asks if she would die for them, and, to his bemusement, she confidently says yes.", "Back at the cave, \"Jack\" and Imam find the rock at the opening moving aside and it's a moment of joy and relief for them when they find Fry and Riddick there. All four run to the settlement, but multiple aliens are in the way. They run through them and Riddick sends the rest ahead, himself lagging behind to absorb the attack. The three reach the skiff-ship and Riddick too manages to reach close, but an alien suddenly blocks his way between the buildings. Riddick smartly sways back and forth with it, staying in its blind spot. Unfortunately, as he draws away, a second alien appears behind him and he is \"visible\". The others have hesitated at the skiff-ship, thinking him dead, but then they hear him yell. As Fry rushes towards the sound, Riddick drops down on the ground in front of her, bloody, wounded, gasping, but still clutching his knife. She tries to lift him to his feet, to get to the skiff-ship, but he is too big and heavy. She says \"I said I'd die for them, not you.\" He is finally vertical when she is suddenly stabbed from behind by an alien, then pulled away into the air as it flies away with her. He collapses to the ground and lets out in pain- \"Not for me.\"", "Imam and \"Jack\" chat as Riddick takes the pilot seat, turns on the switches, powers up the engines, getting the skiff-ship ready to go. Surprisingly, he shuts the switches back to off, making the others restless for take-off and relief. Quickly, the aliens are drawn to the now-dark area, menacing the skiff-ship from all sides. He now powers up the skiff-ship's engines again and they take off. His \"parting goodnight\" for those inhabitants of the planet is a deadly blow- the bright light and the force of the engines kill the surrounding aliens all around them as they exit the atmosphere. In space, the three survivors; the Imam, \"Jack\" and Riddick, are relieved that their ordeal is over and watch the darkness give way to sunlight. \"Jack\" asks Riddick what they should tell the authorities about him when they are questioned. He tells her- \"Riddick is dead, he died somewhere on the planet\", implying his transformation back to a caring human heart."]},

It's a pity that the film isn't more gripping because the trappings of the genre are present and correct, it's just the execution which is a bit, well average. The storyline is about a couple of sailors on shore leave who get into a fight which leaves a man dead. Instead of giving themselves up they decide to hide out on a moored boat which just so happens to be occupied by three women, one of whom witnessed the crime. The rest of the film sees them trying to avoid the police investigations, headed over by genre regular Alexander Gauge.", "The film has a mixed cast although most of the characters are underwritten so few have a chance to shine. John McCallum, an Australian star who later went on to produce the famous SKIPPY TV series, is the best of the bunch as the warm and conflicted killer, while Bill Keer is underutilised but quite effective as the psychotic one of the pair. Googie Withers is saddled with an annoying character who I never warmed to, although it's fun to see Joan Hickson in a much larger role than usual. My favourite character was Skinner, played by the delightful Hugh Pryse as a man who uses opportunity to make cash from the situation. If only the film was as fun as his character."]},
