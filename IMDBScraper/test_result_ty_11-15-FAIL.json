He manages to work his way to the top of the prisoner heap by his use of violence against the reigning inmates who attempt to intimidate him. The standard response to inmate-on-inmate violence when asked by the guards is \"I fell sir\" - the fear of retaliation is more compelling than any help you might or might not get from the staff. There's a really brutal and realistic rape scene in the garden shed of a younger looking inmate, while a guard looks in through the window, appearing to be enjoying the scene. When asked \"what's all this then?\" he manages to croak out the expected reply, ludicrous given the obviousness of what happened. The victim ends up killing himself as a result, sparking off a riot. another interesting inmate is the intellectual trying to fight the system in his own non-violent way, equally unsuccessfully. Frankly, there's really not a lot of plot, this movie is mostly about the characters and the conditions in places like these that appear to sadly be the same in a lot of different countries and cultures. It is reminiscent of \"Bad Boys\" starring Sean Penn that came out in the US about the same time, which had a bit more plot than this movie, but was equally bleak in it's portrayal of life inside a juvenile offenders prison/borstal/reform school."]},

The Superintendent of a clan is plotting to take over the clan by implicating the Chamberlain in corrupt activities (activities the Superintendent is actually responsible for). Part of the plan involves killing off the Chamberlain's staff and, in protecting them, Sanjuro sides with them. The supporters are massively outnumbered so it will require all of Sanjuro's cunning and swordcraft to ensure the Superintendent does not succeed in his evil plan.", "A group of idealistic young men, determined to clean up the corruption in their town, are aided by a scruffy, cynical samurai who does not at all fit their concept of a noble warrior.", "In Japan circa Eighteenth Century, nine young men decide to present an accusation of corruption in their clan to the local superintendent. However, the group is betrayed, but the ronin Sanjûrô Tsubaki (Toshirô Mifune) saves them from the superintendent's men. The uncle of the leader of the rebel clansmen, the Chamberlain Mutsuta (Yûnosuke Itô), is kidnapped, and his wife and daughter are detained and made prisoner of the superintendent, and he tries to force Mutsuta to write a fake confession letter declaring being corrupt. Sanjûrô helps the group to rescue the Chamberlain and his family.", "The story begins with nine young samurai, who are worried about corruption in the leadership of their clan. Although they know of two elders who are \"bad,\" the youths misjudge who the real mastermind behind these two is, and end up asking that wrong one for help. As the nine meet secretly at a temple and discuss their problem, a ronin (Mifune) suddenly appears from another room. The ronin explains the stupidity and naiveté of their conclusions and decides to help them.", "The plot then unfolds as he tries to outwit the three evil elders and their minions, with the young samurai constantly ruining his plans. Despite evidence to the contrary, some of them continue to regard the ronin as a problem figure: he has bad manners, behaviour unbecoming of a samurai, weird ways to express his thoughts, and bizarre attitude to violence. He insults his companions directly, and prefers to sleep around rather than accompany them on missions. He obviously has no compunction killing people, often unnecessarily.", "A key objective is the rescue of Mutsuta, an honest official, and his family. Mutsuta's wife (played by Takao Irie) is rescued early on, but remains strangely oblivious to the danger around her, and maintains a cheery civility in comic contrast to the tension of the young samurai. She asks the ronin's name; looking out the window at tsubaki (camellia) trees, he invents the name Tsubaki Sanjr (from sanj 'thirty', because he always aks for thirty ryo). The lady insists as if advising him on table manners that Mr Tsubaki refrain from unnecessary killing. The lady shows insight when she compares Sanjuro to a \"glittering sword\" and remarks that \"the best sword stays in its scabbard.\"", "The nine young samurai begin as innocent idealistic greenhorns who judge on appearances, are easily duped by a more experienced elder, and are quick to stumble into danger without even knowing what they are doing. They end wiser: they have learned the virtues of patience.", "The famous final scene of his duel with Hanbei, the henchman of the corrupt superintendent, is poignant. Throughout the story, Sanjuro poses as a bad ronin who is after making a quick score. He is so convincing that Hanbei (Tatsuya Nakadai) swallows his line and becomes the unwitting accomplice of his own demise. He cannot stand being made a fool and challenges Sanjuro to a duel. Sanjuro is reluctant to fight and tries to dissuade Hanbei saying that if they do fight, one of them would die and there is nothing to be gained from that.", "Hanbei insists and the two face each other. And then, in a flash, it's over: a fountain of blood gushes from Hanbei and he slumps to the ground, lifeless. When the young samurai cheer his victory, Sanjuro becomes extremely agitated and angry at their naive insensitivity . In the most revealing remark, he states that dead adversary was exactly like him, so that at least he now has an understanding of what he really represents. Sanjuro then leaves towards an unspecified direction"]},

The two hillbillies tie Ed to a tree with his belt around his throat and force Bobby at gunpoint to strip naked. The lead hillbilly chases after and physically harasses Bobby as he tries to escape.

They would be put on trial in a small town courthouse and that the judge and entire jury would be comprised of \"the dead man's friends and relatives\". Likewise, Bobby does not want the story of his rape to become public. Lewis tells them that since the entire area will be flooded by a lake soon, the body would never be found, and that the escaped hillbilly could not possibly risk informing the police on them, since he had participated in the assault.

The man stumbles toward Ed and is about to kill him when he drops his rifle and collapses, revealing Ed's arrow protruding through the back of his neck (Ed had in fact hit him after all).

His rope breaks and he and the dead body fall into the river. Ed swims ashore and meets with Bobby and Lewis. Ed asks more than once if Bobby is certain the dead man is the same toothless hillbilly as the one they confronted earlier. Clearly irritated and not completely sure himself, Ed snaps at Bobby and asks him to confirm the dead man's identity. Bobby does not answer.", "Ed and Bobby weigh the dead hillbilly down with stones and drop him into the river and then set out with the injured Lewis in the surviving canoe. A little later, they come upon Drew's grotesquely-contorted corpse stuck on a dead-fall in the river. After being unable to find any definite gunshot wound on the dead Drew (save for a deep gash on his forehead which may or may not be a graze from a bullet), they also weigh the body down with rocks and release it into the river. Ed points out that they don't want the authorities examining Drew's body and possibly discovering a gunshot wound. Ed gives a short eulogy and sinks Drew into the river to ensure that he will never be found. With Lewis injured and Drew dead, Ed becomes the leader, trying to ensure their story is consistent, knowing the authorities will investigate.", "After canoeing through more rapids, Ed, Bobby, and Lewis finally reach their destination, the town of Aintry, which will soon be submerged by the river and is currently being evacuated.

While they are uncertain whether the apparently unconscious Lewis understands them, as the doctors enter, Lewis appears to awaken, gives Ed and Bobby a knowing wink, and says he remembers nothing. Ed and Bobby then spend the night at a local boarding house and have an uneventful dinner with the local tenants who tell them that they are leaving town soon because of the dam-lake project.", "Another day or two later, Ed and Bobby pack up their vehicles outside the boarding house and they prepare to pick Lewis up from the hospital and drive home. Just then, Sheriff Bullard suddenly appears and asks Ed why there were four life jackets found in the canoe when only he, Lewis, and Bobby came out of the river. Stammering, Bobby suggests there may have been an extra one. But Ed intervenes and says 'no', that Drew was not wearing his life jacket when he fell into the river and he does not know why. The sheriff also tells them that his men found the remains of one of the canoes above the last set of rapids where the guys claim that Drew drowned, plus no trace of Drew's body has been found along the river. Ed continues to feign ignorance, claiming not to know anything as well as claiming not to have seen anyone else in the area.", "While the Sheriff remains suspicious, but having no evidence as to what did happen he simply tells Ed: \"Don't ever do nothing' like this again. Don't ever come back up here. I don't ever wanna see you or your friends again! I'd kinda like to see this town die peaceful,\" to which Ed readily agrees and drives away with Bobby.", "The men vow to keep their story a secret for the rest of their lives. In the final scene, Ed awakes screaming from a nightmare in which a dead man's hand rises from the lake."]},

One of his few functioning muscles is his left eye. His physical situation and hospitalization uncomfortably bring together the many people in his life, including: Céline Desmoulins, his ex-lover and mother of his children; Inès, his current lover; and his aged father who he calls Papinou. Among his compassionate recuperative team are his physical therapist Marie, and his speech therapist Henriette. Henriette eventually teaches him to communicate using a system where he spells out words: she reads out the letters of the alphabet in descending order of their use in the French language, and he blinks his functioning left eye when she reaches the appropriate letter.

During the next 14 months, using a communication code developed by his therapist and his publisher's assistant, who transcribed this code, Bauby was able to compose, letter by letter, a lyrical and heartbreaking memoir of his life struggle.

Leave me alone.\" He changes his mind following the visit of an old friend, Roussin (", "), who had been a hostage for four years in Beirut. Relating his own experience, he tells Bauby, \"Hang on to the human who is inside you,\" to which Bauby answers, \"Easy said.\" However, on his second encounter with his speech therapist, to Henriette's great distress Jean-Do spells out, \"I want to die.\" Jean-Do's remarkable strength of character eventually leads him to acknowledge his desperate situation, but also to realize that he still has his imagination and his memories.

We see that he was traumatized as a child, when he and his family were circus performers, and when he witnessed a murder/suicide: his father, an American expatriate living in Mexico under suspicious circumstances, cuts off the arms of his beloved mother, a possessive wife and religious fanatic who led a heretical church called \"Santa Sangre (Holy Blood),\" the members of which worshipped a martyred girl whose arms were severed by her father following her rape, and then commit suicide. Back in the present, buttressed by shock of his remembrance, he escapes the sanitarium and, in a series of hallucinations and dream-fulfillments, believes he has rejoined his armless mother.

Awakened from his stupor, he's taken on a field trip with his fellow residents when by chance he sees someone from his past; the nexus to unspeakable trauma he suffered as a boy.

Fenix had tragic childhood in the circus owned by his father Orgo, who is a knife thrower. During a performance, his mother Concha, who is a trapeze artist and a fanatic religious woman, sees from the trapeze her husband cheating on her with The Tattooed Woman. She leaves the trapeze, locks Fenix in the trailer and throws acid on Orgo's penis. Orgo uses his knives to cut off both arms of Concha and commit suicide. The Tattooed Woman flees from the circus with her deaf and dumb stepdaughter Alma, who is Fenix's best friend, and Fenix sees everything. One night, Fenix sees The Tattooed Woman in a red-light district and soon he escapes from the institution. He meets Concha and their former friend Aladin and works in a theater, with Fenix performing Concha's arms. Meanwhile, Concha controls him and Fenix begins a crime spree.", "The film starts with a naked man named Fenix, sitting in a tree in a mental asylum. Nurses come out to him, bringing a plate of conventional food, which he refuses. When he is offered the plate of a raw fish, Fenix descends from the tree and eats as the nurses get him to put on some overalls.", "Flashback\nThe film flashes back into Fenix's childhood, which he spent performing as a \"child magician\" in a circus run by his father Orgo, the knife-thrower, and his mother Concha, a trapeze artist and aerialist. The circus crew also includes, among others, a tattooed woman, who acts as the object of Orgo's knife-throwing feats, her adopted daughter Alma (a hearing-impaired, voiceless mime and tightrope walker whom Fenix fancies, with the feeling mutual), Fenix's dwarf friend Aladin, a pack of clowns and a small elephant. Orgo carries on a very public flirtation with the tattooed woman, and their knife-throwing act is heavily sexualized.", "Concha is also the leader of a religious cult that considers, as its patron saint, a little girl who was raped and had her arms cut off by two brothers. Their church is about to be bulldozed at the behest of the owner of the land, and the followers make one last stand against the police and the bulldozers. A Roman Catholic Monsignor drives into the conflict, saying that he will prevent its demolition, but after he enters the temple to inspect it he deems it blasphemous and unworthy (the girl worshipped is no saint, he says, and the supposed pool of \"holy blood\" at the center of the edifice contains just red paint), so the demolition is carried out. Fenix leads Concha back to the circus, where she finds out about Orgo's affair, but Orgo, being also a hypnotist, puts Concha in a trance and rapes her.", "The circus elephant then dies, much to Fenix's grief, and a public funeral is conducted, in which the elephant is paraded through the city inside a giant casket. The casket is then dropped into the city dump, where scavengers open it up and proceed to carve up the elephant and take away the meat. Orgo consoles his son by tattooing a spread-eagled phoenix onto his chest, identical to the one on his own chest, using a knife dipped in red ink. This tattoo, Orgo says, will make Fenix a man.", "Later on, Concha, during her trapeze act, sees Orgo and the tattooed woman sneak out of the big top. She chases after them and, seeing them sexually engaged, pours a bottle of sulphuric acid onto Orgo's genitals. Orgo retaliates by cutting off both her arms (much like the girl previously venerated). He then walks into the street and slits his own throat. Fenix witnesses this, locked inside a trailer. He then sees the tattooed woman driving off with Alma.", "Flash-forward\nBack in the present, Fenix is taken out to a movie theater, along with other patients, most of whom have Down syndrome. A pimp intercepts them and persuades them to take cocaine and follow him to meet an overweight prostitute. Fenix then spots the Tattooed Woman, who is now a prostitute, and becomes filled with rage. Back in the asylum, Fenix's armless mother Concha calls out for him from the street and he escapes by climbing down a rope from his cell window. The Tattooed Woman is shown trying to prostitute Alma, who runs away and sleeps on the roof of a truck. The Tattooed Woman is then mutilated and killed by the hands of unseen woman.", "Mother and son go on to perform an act whereby he stands behind her and moves his arms so that they appear to be Concha's arms that are moving. But Concha soon starts to use her son's hands to kill those women whom she deems a threat to her, including a young performer that he kills with a knife-throw, as well as a cross-dressing wrestler, whom he slashes with a katana. A dream sequence subsequently shows that he has killed many more women, all of whose memories haunt him.", "Alma finds Fenix and together they plan to run away from Concha and her house. She tries to force Fenix to murder Alma as well, but, after a struggle, he manages to plunge a knife into Concha's stomach. Yet she does not die but taunts him by saying she will always be inside him as she vanishes before his eyes. Through a quick series of flashbacks, it is revealed that Concha actually died after being maimed by Orgo, and that Fenix has actually kept a mannequin of his armless mother for performing on stage and at home, which also now appears in reality to be a thoroughly dilapidated house. He destroys the home-made temple and throws away the mannequin with the help of his imaginary childhood friends, Aladin and the clowns.", "Alma proceeds to lead Fenix outside the house where police are waiting and order them to put up their hands. As they both comply, Fenix watches his own hands in awe as he does so. And Fenix's realization that he has finally regained control of them brings him joy and peace."]},

The phone rings, interrupting their argument, and Abby answers but the caller doesn't speak.

Meurice goes to confront Ray about the theft of the money. Abby goes to Marty's bar to try to find out what happened with Ray. Abby finds the bar ransacked, the safe's combination lock dented, chipped, and partially shattered. The private detective had been trying to break into the safe to retrieve the photo and was interrupted by Abby's arrival: he is hiding in the bar watching Abby move about.

Ray is at his apartment packing when Abby arrives. Abby thinks that Marty refused to pay Ray, that Ray broke into the bar to get his money, and that the two of them got into a fight. Ray interrupts and tells her he found her gun at the bar, that he can't eat or sleep lately, and that Marty was alive when he buried him.", "Abby leaves to tell Meurice that she thinks Marty is dead; Meurice leaves for the bar. Ray is at the bar; he opens the safe and finds the faked photo showing him and Abby in bed, bodies riddled with holes, blood staining the sheets. He leaves for Abby's apartment and notices the same older model VW parked behind him, the same car that was following them earlier,when they ended up at the motel. Ray pulls out, and the private detective follows him. Abby arrives at her apartment and turns on the lights; Ray is looking out a large window and tells Abby to turn off the light. Abby is reluctant to do so. The private detective is on top of a nearby building, watching the two through a sniper scope, and shoots Ray through the back, killing him. Abby runs to crouch beneath the window, takes off her shoes, and throws them at the light bulb, breaking it. Visser arrives at Abby's apartment, and she goes into the bathroom to hide; outside the bathroom window is a precipitous drop. In Abby's sparsely furnished living room, Visser bludgeons Ray with a large coin bank, then searches Ray's pockets for the lighter, thinking he took it. Failing to find it, he goes into the bathroom. Abby is not there; he looks outside the window, then hearing a sound through the wall, he reaches his arm over, finding another window. He opens the window; Abby slams it on top of his wrist and drives a knife through his hand into the windowsill. The detective screams and then shoots holes through the wall and finally punches through and removes the knife from his other hand. Abby, dazed, backs out of the room and slides down the wall opposite the bathroom door, finding her revolver on the table by the door. The door is partly closed; eventually the man's shadow darkens the doorway, and Abby fires through the door, using up the third and final bullet. The detective falls. \"I'm not afraid of you, Marty,\" Abby says. Visser, laying out on the bathroom floor, bleeding from his chest and hand, suddenly bursts into laughing. \"Well, ma'am, if I see him, I'll sure give him the message.\" The detective lies looking up at the underside of the bathroom sink. Water collects on its underside, grows into a drop, and drips. The movie ends."]},

Mufasa tells Simba he's forbidden from ever going there. Out in the plains, Mufasa tells Simba that there is a balance to all life which eventually comes full circle; the Circle of Life. When Zazu appears with a morning report, Mufasa takes the opportunity to give Simba a pouncing lesson which goes successfully, much to Zazu's dismay. As Simba gets ready to try again, Zazu suddenly exclaims that a group of hyenas has been seen in the Pride Lands. Mufasa rushes off to deal with it while Zazu takes Simba home.", "Simba returns to Pride Rock where his Uncle Scar is lurking about. Simba brags about his fate to be king to which Scar reacts without the slightest bit of enthusiasm. Casually, and goading Simba's excitement, Scar asks if Mufasa showed him the shadow place on their morning walk. When Simba replies no, Scar adds that it is a dangerous place where only the bravest lions venture. Simba perks up, saying he's brave, and begs his uncle to tell him what's there. Scar feigns an accidental slip of the tongue by revealing that it's an elephant graveyard but praises Simba's cleverness. He asks that Simba never explore the place, but as Simba reassures him and leaves, Scar smiles to himself knowing full well that Simba's curiosity will get the better of him.", "Simba meets up with his friend Nala (", ") who is being bathed by her mother, Sarafina ", ". He tells her about a cool place he has found, lying to Sarabi that its around the water hole. Sarabi gives them permission to go as long as Zazu accompanies them. Along the way, Simba and Nala devise a plan together to get rid of Zazu, which works. They then run off, Nala showing off her skills as an expert pinner, before finding themselves in the elephant graveyard. Suddenly, Zazu reappears and demands that they leave. Simba shows off his bravery by laughing in front of a large skull. Laughter echoes from within and three hyenas emerge, surrounding the cubs. Shenzi (", "), Banzai (", "), and Ed (", ") deliberate what's to be done with the cubs, more specifically, how to eat them. The cubs and Zazu escape for a moment, but Zazu is pulled back and stuffed into a boiler which shoots him into the air. The hyenas eventually corner the cubs in an alcove and Simba tries to roar. The hyenas laugh and tell him to try again. A real roar is let out as Mufasa appears and attacks the hyenas before they run off. Zazu reappears by Mufasa's side and Simba tries to say something but Mufasa furiously reprimands him for being deliberately disobedient and leads them towards home.", "Back in the Pride Lands, Mufasa tells Zazu to take Nala home while he teaches Simba a lesson. Fearful and meek, Simba walks up to his father, noticing that his father's paw print is much bigger than his own. He apologizes for disobeying but says he only wanted to be brave like Mufasa. Mufasa tells Simba he's only brave when he has to be. As they reconcile, Mufasa tells Simba that all the stars in the night sky are the spirits of kings past and that they will always be there to guide him, as will he.", "Back in the graveyard, the hyenas lick their wounds and quarrel with each other. Their fights are broken up by Scar who is greeted as a friend. Irritated that the hyenas couldn't dispose of the cubs, he proposes a plan that would eliminate both Simba and Mufasa from the throne.", "The next day, Scar escorts Simba through a gorge and puts him near a rock shaded by a sapling, telling him that Mufasa is planning a surprise for him. Scar instructs Simba to stay put while he fetches Mufasa and suggests that he practice his roar while he's away. Just above the gorge, the three hyenas lie in wait in front of a massive herd of wildebeest. Scar appears above them, signaling them. As Simba waits, scowling over his little roar, a chameleon climbs down from the tree. Simba practices roaring at it, finally letting off one loud enough to scare the chameleon and echo off all sides of the gorge. But the ground starts shaking and Simba looks up to see the herd of wildebeest charging down the gorge straight for him. He runs away, the wildebeest gaining, while Scar warns Mufasa nearby that there is a stampede in the gorge and Simba is down there. Simba manages to grab hold of a broken tree, elevating himself above the wildebeests' horns while Mufasa climbs down and runs alongside the animals. He manages to grab Simba in his mouth and carries him to safety, but is pulled back by the charging animals. After a tense moment, Simba watches his father leap onto the side of the gorge, digging his claws into the dirt and struggling up the hillside. As Mufasa nears the top, he sees Scar standing over him. He pleads for help, but Scar digs his claws into his paws and mocks him before pushing him off. Simba watches helplessly as Mufasa falls onto the stampeding herd.", "As the dust settles, Simba runs down to look for his father. He discovers him beneath a broken tree, dead. As he mourns his loss, Scar appears and blames Simba for what happened. Simba, thinking he had started the stampede that killed his father, follows his uncles advice when Scar tells him to run away and never return. Simba runs off as Scar instructs his hyenas to kill him. The three hyenas chase Simba to the edge of an incline where he tumbles into a sea of brambles. Small enough to avoid the sharp spikes, Simba runs through them as the hyenas barely manage to stop near the base. Unlucky Banzai is shoved into the brambles and emerges howling, stuck with thorns. The hyenas watch as Simba runs into the distant desert and decide that he will most likely die, shouting to him that if he ever comes back they will kill him.", "Scar returns to Pride Rock to announce that both Simba and Mufasa have perished in the stampede and assumes the role as king. The lionesses look on in fear as a horde of hyenas arrives to live alongside Scar at Pride Rock. Rafiki watches sullenly from a distance and smears the image he had once created of Simba.", "In the desert, Simba has collapsed under the heat and a group of vultures descends on him. Suddenly, a meerkat and a warthog charge into them, bucking and kicking them away as part of their favorite game; bowling for buzzards. The warthog, Pumbaa (", "), then discovers Simba and brings him to the attention of his meerkat companion, Timon (", "). Timon is initially afraid of the young lion but Pumbaa asserts that he's still little and will grow up to be on their side instead of eating them. Timon scoffs at the idea, before suggesting the very same thing as his own. Pumbaa picks Simba up and carries him into the shade where he's revived. Simba thanks them for their help before walking away. Timon and Pumbaa take pity on him and tell him that, whatever happened to him, he has to put his past behind him, citing their motto Hakuna Matata; no worries. They then invite Simba to stay with them as a fellow outcast in their jungle paradise and teach him to eat bugs rather than meat. Simba begins to cheer up and eventually grows into a healthy, carefree adult (", ").", "Meanwhile, the Pride Lands have been reduced to a wasteland under Scars rule. Zazu is confined to a bone cage singing while Scar lazily lies about chewing on bones. Zazu mutters under his breath that he never had to do this under Mufasa. Scar reels on the name, citing that the law is to never mention Mufasas name. Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed appear, complaining that food and water have become scarce and that the lionesses refuse to hunt. Scar suggests they eat Zazu as Banzai lets slip Mufasas name before he corrects himself under Scars glare. Scar then dismisses them.", "Back in the jungle, Simba, Timon, and Pumbaa lie down together after a meal of bugs to look up at the night sky. Pumbaa asks what the sparkling lights in the sky are to which Timon replies that they're fireflies that got stuck in the big, bluish-black thing. Pumbaa says he'd always thought they were burning balls of gas billions of miles away, a theory which Timon debunks due to Pumbaa's flatulent nature. They ask Simba what he thinks. Answering only to their begging, he says he was once told that the lights are great kings of the past watching over them. Timon starts cracking up over the thought of royal dead guys watching them, but Simba wanders off, saddened over the memory of his father. He sighs and collapses onto a bunch of wild flowers, spreading their petals and leaves to the wind. The wind carries them back to the Pride Lands where Rafiki, sitting atop his tree, grabs them. He takes them back into the tree where he sniffs them and contemplates the apparent familiar smell. Suddenly it strikes him; Simba must be alive. Crazed with happiness, he quickly smears a mane around the head of his Simba drawing, stating that it is time.", "Timon and Pumbaa are walking through the jungle together when Pumbaa becomes distracted by a large rhino beetle. Hungry, he follows it to the edge of the jungle and sneaks up on it as its perched on a log facing some grassland. His eye then catches something in the tall grass as the beetle flies away. Pumbaa screams as a lioness emerges from the grasses and gives chase. Hearing Pumbaa, Timon comes running and finds him stuck in the roots of a tree. He tries to free Pumbaa as the lioness draws closer. She leaps forward but Simba jumps in and begins to fight with her while Timon cheers him on. He tries to knock her down but she flips him over and pins him to the ground. Simba recognizes this move and his old friend, Nala (", "). When he reveals himself, Nala is shocked and happy to see him again. Simba introduces her to Pumbaa and Timon, who is less than happy about the reunion since Nala had tried to eat Pumbaa. Nala tells Simba that everyone in the Pride Lands thought he was dead after Scar told them about the stampede. Nervous, Simba asks what else Scar told them, but Nala says that it doesn't matter now that he's alive and the rightful king. Simba excuses Timon and Pumbaa to speak to Nala alone. As they walk through the jungle together the romantic settings encourage their feelings for each other, though Simba is hesitant to talk to Nala about his past. She tries to get Simba to go back to the Pride Lands with her, telling him that everything has fallen into disarray since Scar took the throne. He refuses, explaining that he shouldn't worry about things that happened in the past, which angers Nala. She tells Simba that returning to the throne is his responsibility but he storms off and walks out of the jungle to an open field. He tries to justify his decision before yelling at the night sky that Mufasa wasn't there for him and feeling solemn that it was his fault.", "He then hears singing coming from a tree behind him and sees Rafiki in the branches. Irritated, he walks away. Rafiki follows him and asks him a series of rhetorical questions and chanting seemingly nonsensical words. Convinced that the baboon is crazy and confused, Simba turns to walk away when Rafiki reveals that he knows Simba is Mufasas son. Rafiki then runs off and Simba follows. He finds Rafiki mediating on a rock and asks if he knew his father. Rafiki says \"I know your father\", to which Simba responds that he died. Rafiki laughs, saying that Mufasa is alive, and leads Simba through a thicket of trees and vines. They stop at a reflecting pool and Rafiki instructs Simba to look into it. Seeing only his reflection at first, Simba looks harder and sees an image of Mufasa. Rafiki says that Mufasa lives within him as a large storm cloud appears overhead and a specter of Mufasa speaks out to Simba, saying that he has forgotten who he is and that he must take his rightful place as the true king of Pride Rock. Simba begs his father to stay but the apparition disappears, echoing that Simba must remember who he is. As Simba contemplates the message and the change in the winds, Rafiki wallops him over the head with his staff. Outraged and in pain, Simba asks what he did that for. Rafiki says that it doesn't matter because its in the past, but though the past may still hurt, one can either run from it or learn from it. He swings his staff again and Simba ducks before grabbing the staff and throwing it away. Then Rafiki watches and cheers as Simba runs off, announcing that he's going back.", "Timon and Pumbaa are sleeping together as Nala approaches them and nudges them awake, frightening them at first. She asks if they've seen Simba but Rafiki appears overhead and declares that the king has returned. Confused by this statement and Rafikis mysterious arrival and departure, Timon and Pumbaa listen as Nala tries to explain that Simba has decided to go back to the Pride Lands to take his place as king.", "Crossing the desert, Simba finally arrives in the Pride Lands to find it dark and barren. He eyes Pride Rock with a look of vengeance when Nala, Timon, and Pumbaa appear beside him. They all agree to help Simba reclaim the throne, though Timon is less than impressed by the landscape they're fighting for. They sneak over to Pride Rock and discover that its crawling with hyenas. Simba offers Timon and Pumbaa as live bait and they do put on a colorful performance for the hungry hyenas while he and Nala move closer. Simba instructs Nala to rally the lionesses while he looks for Scar. He finds him at the base of Pride Rock, calling loudly for Sarabi. Hyenas nip at her heels as she approaches and Simba looks on mournfully. Scar questions her as to why the lionesses refuse to hunt. Sarabi explains that the herds have moved on and their only chance for survival is to leave Pride Rock. Scar refuses and, when Sarabi compares him to Mufasa, he cruelly hits her. Having seen enough, Simba appears on a ledge and runs down to comfort his mother. Scar backs away, fearful that its Mufasa that has returned, but when he realizes who it really is, he shoots a hateful glare at Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed. Simba confronts Scar, demanding that he step down from the throne or fight, but sly Scar asks why things must end in violence and says he would feel terrible if he were responsible for the death of a family member. Though Simba says he's put the past behind him, Scar questions whether the lionesses have done the same. When Nala questions this, Scar prompts Simba to tell them all who was responsible for Mufasas death. Sadly, Simba confesses that he was, though it was an accident. Scar uses this and accuses Simba of being a murderer, backing him up to the end of Pride Rock to the point where Simba slips over the edge, dangling by his paws. Lightning strikes and ignites a fire beneath him as Scar looks over him, remarking that this was just the way Mufasa looked before he died. Then Scar grabs Simbas paws and whispers in his ear that he was the one to kill Mufasa.", "Enraged, Simba leaps over the edge and pins Scar, choking him to confess the truth to the lionesses. Fighting immediately breaks out between the hyenas and the lions. Timon and Pumbaa join the fray with their signature bowling moves and Rafiki impresses with some acrobatic martial arts. When Timon is cornered by Shenzi and Banzai in the lions den with Zazu, Pumbaa comes to the rescue, his fury provoked when Banzai accidentally calls him a pig.", "Scar manages to slip away from the fighting but is followed by Simba. They meet at the top of Pride Rock surrounded by flames where Scar begs for his life, saying that he's family and that the hyenas are the real enemy. Having heard this, the hyenas back away growling. Simba relents, saying that he's not like Scar and tells him to run away and never return. Scar meekly walks past him but sends a pile of embers into Simbas face, blinding him for a moment. Scar then attacks Simba and a fierce fight ensues. Scar manages to knock Simba down and leaps at him but, using the technique Nala had mastered in her pinning, Simba flips Scar with his hind legs over the edge of Pride Rock. Scar tumbles down the rock face and lands at the base. He groggily stands up and notices the hyenas approaching him from between the flames. He greets them as his friends but they respond that he said they were the enemy. Scar looks at them in horror as they lick their lips and surround him before attacking.", "Rain begins to fall and Simba returns to the lionesses where he greets his mother and Nala. Rafiki rattles his staff and points it towards the tip of Pride Rock. He bows to Simba, who gives him a hug, and says it is time. As everyone watches, and as the rain washes away dust and bones, Simba ascends Pride Rock, gazing one last time at the heavens before letting out a mighty roar and sealing his position as king. The lionesses join in, hailing their new king. Some time later, the animals of the Pride Lands gather once again at Pride Rock, cheering at Simba and Nala as they overlook the kingdom. Rafiki comes between them and holds up their newborn cub for all to see."]},

He, like those in his network, are vain, narcissistic, egomaniacal and competitive, always having to one up everyone else in that presentation of oneself, but he, unlike the others, realizes that, for himself, all of these are masks to hide what is truly underneath, someone/something inhuman in nature. In other words, he is comprised of a shell resembling a human that contains only greed and disgust, greed in wanting what others may have, and disgust for those who do not meet his expectations and for himself in not being the first or the best. That disgust ends up manifesting itself in wanting to rid the world of those people, he not seeing them as people but only of those characteristics he wants to rid.", "Patrick Bateman is handsome, well educated and intelligent. He is twenty-seven and living his own American dream. He works by day on Wall Street, earning a fortune to complement the one he was born with. At night he descends into madness, as he experiments with fear and violence.", "A white background. Red drops begin to fall past the opening credits. The drops become a red sauce on a plate. A slab of meat is cut with a knife and garnished with raspberries, then placed on a table. The camera moves over various dishes, most of which are very small and look very expensive. The restaurant is furnished in pinks and greens, and everyone is well-dressed. Waiters tell customers ridiculously decadent specials like squid ravioli and swordfish meatloaf.", "The setting is New York City, sometime in the 1980s. The vice-presidents of Pierce and Pierce, a Wall Street financial institution, are seated around a table. They include Timothy Bryce (Justin Theroux), Craig McDermott (Josh Lucas), David Van Paten (Bill Sage) and Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale). Bryce says \"This is a chick's restaurant. Why aren't we at Dorsia?\" McDermott replies \"Because Bateman won't give the maitre d' head.\" Bateman flicks a toothpick at him. They discuss various people in the restaurant, including who Bateman believes to be Paul Allen across the room. Van Paten returns from the bathroom and says that there's no good place to do coke in. They discuss the fact that Allen is handling the Fisher account, which leads McDermott to make racist remarks about Allen being Jewish. \"Jesus, McDermott, what does that have to do with anything?\" says Patrick. \"I've seen that bastard sitting in his office spinning a fucking menorah.\" Bateman rebukes him. \"Not a menorah. A dreidel, you spin a dreidel.\" McDermott replies \"Do you want me to fry you up some potato pancakes? Some latkes?\" \"No, just cool it with the anti-Semitic remarks.\" \"Oh I forgot. Bateman's dating someone from the ACLU!\" Bryce calls Bateman the voice of reason. Looking at the check he remarks \"Speaking of reasonable, only $570.\" They all drop their Platinum American Express cards on top of the bill.", "At a nightclub, Bryce takes some money out of a clip and gives it to a man in drag, who lets them inside. As some 80's pop music plays from overhead, the men dance while strobe lights flash and some women on stage wave around prop guns like something out of a grind house flick. Bateman orders a drink and hands the bartender a drink ticket, but she tells him drink tickets are no good and that he has to pay in cash. He pays, and then when she's out of earshot, he says \"You're a fucking ugly bitch. I want to stab you to death, then play around with your blood.\" He takes his drink with a smile.", "The camera pans through Bateman's apartment the next morning. Everything is shades of white, with black counters and shelves. It is sparsely decorated, but looks expensive. \"I live in the American Gardens building on West 81st street, on the 11th floor. My name is Patrick Bateman. I'm 27 years old.\" He describes his diet and exercise routine, and his meticulous daily grooming rituals, which involves no less than 9 different lotions and cleansers. \"There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman,\" he says while peeling off his herb-mint facial mask. \"Some kind of abstraction. But there is no 'real me'. Only an entity. Something illusory. And though I can hide my cold gaze, and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours, and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably comparable, I simply am not there.\"", "Sweeping over the skyline of downtown New York, the song Walking on Sunshine starts playing. Walking down the hallway to his office, Bateman listens to this song on his headphones with absolutely no expression on his face. Someone passes by him and says \"Hey Hamilton. Nice tan.\" Everyone in the hallway has expensive suits and slicked-back hair. He walks by his secretary, Jean (Chloe Sevigny), to his office door. She's dressed in a long coat and shirt that are too big for her. \"Aerobics class, sorry. Any messages?\" She follows him into his corner office. She tells him someone cancelled, but she doesn't know what he cancelled or why. \"I occasionally box with him at the Harvard Club.\" She tells him someone named Spencer wants to meet for drinks. He tells her to cancel it. \"What should I say?\" \"Just say no.\" He tells her to make reservations for him at a restaurant for lunch, as well as dinner reservations at Arcadia on Thursday. \"Something romantic?\" \"No, silly. Forget it. I'll make them. Just get me a mineral water.\" She tells him he looks nice. Without looking at her, he tells her not to wear that outfit. \"Wear a dress or a skirt. You're prettier than that.\" The phone starts ringing, and he tells her to tell anyone who calls that he isn't there. \"And high heels.\" She leaves. He puts his feet up and starts watching Jeopardy on his office TV.", "A taxicab makes its way through Chinatown. Inside, Bateman is trying to listen to the new Robert Palmer album on his headphones, but his \"supposed\" fiancée Evelyn (Reese Witherspoon) keeps distracting him with ideas for their wedding. He says he can't take the time off work to get married. \"Your father practically owns the company. You can do anything you like, silly. You hate that job anyway, I don't see why you don't just quit.\" \"Because... I want... to fit... IN.\" The cab drives up to a restaurant called Espace. \"I'm on the verge of tears as we arrive, since I'm positive we won't have a decent table. But we do, and relief washes over me, in an awesome wave.\" Bryce it already seated next to two punk-rock teens smoking cigarettes. \"This is my cousin Vanden and her boyfriend Stash,\" says Evelyn. Bryce kisses Evelyn on both cheeks, and then starts kissing her neck, slightly crossing the line. Bateman looks at his blurry reflection in a metal menu. As they eat sushi, he remarks \"I'm fairly certain that Timothy Bryce and Evelyn are having an affair. Timothy is the only interesting person I know.\" Bateman doesn't care because he's also having an affair with Courtney Rawlinson, her best friend. \"She's usually operating on one or more psychiatric drugs, tonight I believe it's Xanax.\" She's also engaged to Luis Carruthers, \"the biggest doofus in the business.\" Courtney and Luis are seated beside him, and Courtney, slurring her words, asks Stash whether he thinks Soho is becoming too commercial. \"Yes. I read that,\" says Luis. \"Oh who gives a rat's ass,\" says Bryce. \"That affects us,\" says Vanden. \"What about the massacres in Sri Lanka, honey? Don't you know that the Sikhs are killing like, tons of Israelis over there?\" Bateman tells him there are more important problems to worry about than Sri Lanka. He tells them they include Apartheid, nuclear arms, terrorism, and world hunger. \"We have to provide food and shelter for the homeless, and oppose racial discrimination and promote civil rights, while also promoting equal right for women. We have to encourage a return to traditional moral values. Most importantly, we have to promote general social concern, and less materialism in young people.\" Bryce almost chokes on his drink as he starts laughing. \"Patrick, how thought-provoking,\" Luis says, feigning tears. Patrick takes a swig of his whiskey.", "It's nighttime. Patrick takes some money out of an ATM. A woman walks by and he starts following her. They stop at a crosswalk and he says \"hello\". She hesitantly says hello back. The sign changes to walk and they cross the street.", "The next day, Bateman argues with an old Chinese woman who runs a dry cleaners. Another Chinese man is looking at some bed sheets with a huge red stain on them. Bateman is trying to tell her that you can't bleach that type of sheet, and that they are very expensive. She continues to babble in a language he can't understand. \"Lady, if you don't shut your fucking mouth, I will kill you.\" She is shocked, but still won't speak English. \"I can't understand you! You're a fool! Stupid bitch-ee!\" A woman comes in the door and recognizes him. Her name is Victoria. He says hi to her. \"It's so silly to come all the way up here,\" she says, \"but they really are the best.\" \"Then why can't they get these stains out?\" he says, showing her the sheets. \"Can you get through to them? I'm getting nowhere.\" \"What are those?\" she says, looking wide-eyed at the stains. \"Uh, well it's cranberry juice. Cran-apple.\" She looks skeptical. He tells her he has a lunch date in 15 minutes, and she tries to make plans with him. He tells her he's booked solid. \"What about Saturday?\" \"Next Saturday? Can't. Matinee of Les Mis.\" He promises to call her, and then leaves.", "Patrick paces his apartment in his underwear, on the phone with Courtney Rawlinson (Samantha Mathis). A porno movie is playing on his TV. \"You're dating Luis, he's in Arizona. You're fucking me and we haven't made plans. What could you possibly be up to tonight?\" She says she's waiting for Luis to call. \"Pumpkin you're dating an asshole. Pumpkin you're dating the biggest dickweed in New York. Pumpkin you're dating a tumbling, tumbling dickweed.\" She tells him to stop calling her pumpkin. He insists that they have dinner, and when she says no, he says he can get them a table at Dorsia. This perks her interest. He tells her to wear something nice. He calls the restaurant, and asks if he can make a reservation for two at 8:00 or 8:30. There is a moment of silence on the other end of the phone, then the man on the other end starts laughing uncontrollably. Patrick hangs up.", "In a limo, Patrick listens to Courtney describe her day, while she is almost passing out from her medication. \"Is that Donald Trump's car?\" he asks, looking out the window. Patrick's face is blurred through the plastic divider of the limo. She tells him to shut up. He tells her to take some more lithium, or coke or caffeine to get her out of her slump. \"I just want a child,\" she says, absently looking out the window. \"Just two... perfect... children.\"", "At the restaurant, she nearly falls asleep at the table and Patrick touches her shoulder and wakes her up. \"Are we here?\" she asks sleepily. \"Yeah,\" he says, sitting down. \"This is Dorsia?\" \"Yes dear,\" he says, opening the menu which clearly says Barcadia across it. He tells her she's going to have the peanut butter soup with smoked duck and mashed squash. \"New York Matinee called it a 'playful but mysterious little dish. You'll love it.\" He orders her the red snapper with violets and pine nuts to follow. She thanks him, and then passes out in her chair.", "A conference table at P&P the next day. Luis thanks Patrick for looking after Courtney. \"Dorsia, how impressive. How on Earth did you get a reservation there?\" \"Lucky I guess,\" replies Patrick. Luis compliments him on his suit. \"Valentino Couture?\" \"Uh-huh.\" Luis tries to touch it, but Patrick slaps his hand away. \"Your compliment was sufficient Luis.\" Paul Allen comes up to them. \"Hello Halberstram. Nice tie. How the hell are ya?\" Narrating, Patrick explains that Allen has mistaken him for \"this dickhead Marcus Halberstram.\" They both work at P&P and do the same exact work, and wear the same glasses and suits. \"Marcus and I even go to the same barber. Although I have a slightly better haircut.\" Allen and Patrick discuss accounts. He asks him about Cecilia, Marcus' girlfriend. \"She's great, I'm very lucky,\" replies Patrick. Bryce and McDermott come in, congratulating Allen on the Fisher account. \"Thank you, Baxter.\" Bryce asks him if he wants to play squash. Allen gives him his card out of his case. An audible tremor goes through the room. \"Call me.\" \"How about Friday?\" says Bryce. \"No can do. I got an 8:30 rez at Dorsia. Great sea urchin seviche.\" He leaves. Bryce wonders how he managed to swing that. McDermott thinks he's lying. Bateman takes out his new business card, which reads \"Patrick BATEMAN - Vice President\". \"What do you think?\" \"Very nice,\" says McDermott. \"I picked them up from the printers yesterday.\" \"Nice coloring,\" says Bryce. \"That's 'bone'. And the lettering is something called 'silian rail'.\" \"Cool Bateman. But that's nothing,\" says Van Paten, laying his card down next to Patrick's. \"That is really nice,\" says Bryce. \"Eggshell with romalian type. What do you think?\" Van Paten asks Patrick. \"Nice,\" Patrick says, visibly jealous. \"How did a nitwit like you get so tasteful?\" says Bryce. Biting his nails, Patrick can't believe Bryce prefers Van Paten's card. \"You ain't seen nothing yet,\" says Bryce, taking out his own card. \"Raised lettering, pale nimbus, white.\" Another tremor goes through the room. Holding back his rage, Bateman tells him it's very nice. \"Let's see Paul Allen's card.\" Bryce takes it out of his pocket and hands it to Bateman. It shines with an ethereal glow in the dim light of the conference room, even though it is basically identical to the rest of their cards. Narrating, Patrick says \"Look at the subtle off-white coloring. The tasteful thickness of it. Oh my God. It even has a watermark!\" He drops the card on the table. \"Something wrong?\" asks Luis. \"Patrick? You're sweating.\"", "Nighttime. Patrick walks by a courthouse on his way home. Steam rises from underground vents. He walks through an alley, a black shadow under a pale streetlight. He stops and looks behind him, to see a homeless man by some piles of trash. \"Hello. Pat Bateman. Do you want some money? Some food?\" He starts taking out some money. \"I'm hungry,\" says the bum. \"It's cold out too isn't it? If you're so hungry, why don't you get a job?\" The bum says he lost his job. \"Why? Were you drinking? Insider trading? Just joking.\" He asks him his name, and the bum says his name is Al. \"Get a god-damn job, Al! You have a negative attitude. That's what's stopping you.\" He promises to help him get his act together. Al tells him he's a kind man. He puts his hand on Patrick's arm, and Patrick pulls it off, visibly disgusted. \"You know how bad you smell? You reek of shit. You know that?\" He laughs, and then apologizes. \"I don't have anything in common with you.\" He bends down and opens his briefcase. \"Oh thank you mister, thank you. It's cold out here...\" \"You know what a fucking loser you are?\" Patrick suddenly takes a knife out of the briefcase and stabs the bum three times in the stomach, than pushes the shocked man to the ground. The dog barks at Patrick, so he stomps it with his foot, hard enough to kill it. He picks up his briefcase and walks away down the alley.", "A health spa. A young Asian woman rubs some lotion on Patrick's face. She compliments him on his smooth skin. Later, another Asian woman gives him a manicure. \"I have all the characteristics of a human being. Flesh. Blood. Skin. Hair. But not a single, clear, identifiable emotion, except for greed, and disgust. Something horrible is happening inside me, and I don't know why.\" He is lying in a tanning bed now. \"My nightly bloodlust has overflowed into my days. I feel lethal, on the verge of frenzy. I think my mask of sanity is about to slip.\"", "A Christmas party. A short man in an elf costume hands out glasses of champagne. 'Deck The Halls' is playing in the background. Patrick takes one, scowling at the bizarre costumes. Someone comes up to him and calls him by the wrong name. \"Hey Hamilton. Have a holly-jolly Christmas,\" says Patrick. \"Is Allen still handling the Fisher account?\" He points to Paul Allen across the room. \"Of course. Who else?\" Evelyn comes up to them. \"Mistletoe alert! Merry X-mas Patrick. You're late honey.\" \"I've been here the entire time, you just didn't see me.\" A man behind him puts cloth antlers on Patrick's head without him noticing. \"Say hello to Snowball. Snowball says 'hello Patrick'\", she says in a childish voice. \"What is it?\" Patrick looks with disgust at the creature in her arms. \"It's a little baby piggy-wiggy, isn't it? It's a Vietnamese potbellied pig. They make darling pets. Don't you? Don't you?\" Patrick looks ready to vomit as she pets the animal. \"Stop scowling Patrick. You're such a Grinch. What does Mr. Grinch want for Christmas? And don't say breast implants again.\" Ignoring her, he goes to mingle with the rest of the party. 'Joy to the World' is playing. He says hi to Paul Allen. \"Hey Marcus. Merry Christmas, how've you been. Workaholic I suppose?\" He calls to Hamilton that they are going to Nell's bar, and that the limo is out front. Patrick says that they should have dinner. Paul suggests that he bring Cecilia. \"Cecilia would adore it.\" \"Then let's do it, Marcus.\" Evelyn comes up to them. Paul compliments her on the party, and then walks away. \"Why is he calling you Marcus?\" asks Evelyn. Ignoring this, Patrick says \"Mistletoe alert!\", and kisses her while waving a leafy branch.", "A restaurant. Most of the tables are empty. Patrick takes his reservation under the name Marcus Halberstram. He is led to a table where Paul is already seated, and he is arguing with a waiter. \"I ordered the cilantro crawfish gumbo, which is of course the only excuse one could have for being at this restaurant, which is, by the way, almost completely empty.\" Patrick ignores this and orders a J&B straight and a Corona. The waiter, who looks slightly effeminate and has a red bandana around his neck, starts to list the specials, but Paul cuts him off and orders a double Absolut martini. \"Yes sir. Would you like to hear the specials?\" \"Not if you want to keep your spleen,\" says Patrick. The waiter leaves. \"This is a real beehive of activity Halberstram. This place is hot, very hot,\" Paul comments sarcastically. \"The mud soup and charcoal arugula are outrageous here,\" replies Patrick. Paul derides him for being late. \"I'm a child of divorce, give me a break. I see they've omitted the pork loin with lime Jell-o.\" Paul says he could have gotten them a table at Dorsia instead. \"Nobody goes there anymore. Is that Ivana Trump?\" Patrick says, looking behind him. \"Oh geez Patrick. I mean Marcus. What are you thinking? Why would Ivana be at Texarkana?\" He asks how Paul ended up getting the Fisher account. \"Well I could tell you that Halberstram... but then I'd have to kill ya!\" He laughs. Patrick simply stares at him with a vicious smile.", "They pick at their meals. Patrick says \"I like to dissect girls. Did you know I'm utterly insane?\" Paul doesn't seem to hear him. He compliments him on his tan. When Patrick says he goes to a salon, Paul says he has a tanning bed at home. \"You should look into it.\" Patrick can barely suppress his rage. Paul asks about Cecilia. \"I think she's having dinner with Evelyn Williams.\" \"Evelyn! Great ass. She goes out with that loser Patrick Bateman, what a dork!\" Patrick chuckles with inner contempt. \"Another martini Paul?\"", "Patrick's apartment. Paul lounges drunk on a chair with a bottle of liquor on the floor beside him. Newspapers are taped to the floor of the living room. Patrick picks up a CD. \"Do you like Huey Lewis and the News?\" \"They're OK,\" says Paul. Patrick continues \"Their early work was a little too new wave for my tastes, but when 'Sports' came out in '83, I think they really came into their own. Commercially and artistically.\" He goes to the bathroom and puts on a raincoat. \"The whole album has a clear crisp sound, and a new sheen of consummate professionalism, that really gives the songs a big boost!\" He takes a valium, washes it down, looks at himself in the mirror, and walks back into the living room. On his way back he grabs an axe. Moonwalking backwards, he says that Huey has been compared to Elvis Costello, but that Huey has a more cynical sense of humor. He puts the axe down and starts buttoning up the raincoat behind Paul. \"Hey Halberstram,\" says Paul. \"Why are there copies of the Style section all over the floor? Do you have a dog? A little chow or something?\" He laughs. \"No Allen.\" \"Is that a raincoat?\" \"Yes it is!\" He goes over to the CD player and presses a button. The song 'Hip to Be Square' starts playing. \"In '87, Huey released this, Fore, their most accomplished album. I think their undisputed masterpiece is 'Hip to Be Square'.\" He dances over to the kitchen where he left the axe. \"The song is so catchy, most people probably don't listen to the lyrics, but they should, because it's not just about the pleasures of conformity and the importance of trends, it's also a personal statement about the band itself! Hey Paul!\" Paul looks around too late to see Patrick charge at him with the axe. Screaming, he swings it into Paul's head splattering blood all over his own face. Paul falls to the floor, pouring blood all over the newspapers. Patrick yells \"Try getting a reservation at Dorsia now you fucking stupid bastard!\" He swings it down again, and again, screaming, decapitating him. \"You... fucking... bastard!\" He finally drops the axe and begins composing himself. He takes off the raincoat. He fixes his hair and lights up a cigar. 'Hip to Be Square' continues to play from the stereo.", "Patrick drags the body through the lobby of his building in a black bag. A trail of blood pours from the bottom of the bag. The doorman looks up at him, and then goes back to writing something. Patrick hails a cab outside, and starts stuffing the bag into the trunk. A voice says his name from the sidewalk. It's Luis. \"Patrick. Is that you?\" \"No Luis. It's not me. You're mistaken.\" He introduces Patrick to an attractive Asian woman. \"We're going to Nell's. Gwendolyn's father is buying it. Ooh. Where did you get that overnight bag?\" He eyes the bag with the corpse inside it. \"Jean-Paul Gaultier.\" Patrick slams the trunk and heads off.", "Later, he arrives at Paul's apartment. \"I almost panic when I realize that Paul's place overlooks the park, and is obviously more expensive than mine.\" He finds his suitcases and starts to pack. \"It's time for Paul to take a little trip.\" He throws some clothes in a suitcase, and then goes to the answering machine. In his best imitation of Paul's voice, he records \"It's Paul. I've been called away to London for a few days. Meredith, I'll call you when I get back. Hasta la vista, baby.\" He takes the suitcase and leaves.", "In his office the next day, Patrick listens to the song 'The Lady in Red' by Chris De Burgh on his headphones. Jean comes in and tells him that there's someone named Donald Kimball there to see him. \"Who?\" \"Detective Donald Kimball.\" He looks through the office window. \"Tell him I'm at lunch.\" \"Patrick, it's only 10:30. I think he knows you're here.\" \"Send him in, I guess,\" he says resignedly. Jean goes to get him. Patrick picks up the phone and starts having a pretend conversation with someone, giving him advice on clothes and salons. \"Always tip the stylist fifteen percent. Listen John I've gotta go. T. Boone Pickens just walked in. Heh, just joking. No, don't tip the owner of the salon. Right. Got it.\" He hangs up and apologizes to Kimball. \"No I'm sorry, I should have made an appointment. Was that anything important?\" Patrick gives a vague synopsis of the call. \"Mulling over business problems, examining opportunities, exchanging rumors, spreading gossip.\" They introduce themselves to each other and shake hands. Kimball apologizes again for barging in. Patrick stuffs some magazines and his walkman into a desk drawer. \"So, what's the topic of discussion?\" Kimball explains that Meredith hired him to investigate the disappearance of Paul Allen. \"I just have some basic questions.\" Patrick offers him coffee, which he turns down. He offers him a bottle of water, which he also turns down. Bateman presses the intercom button anyways and tells Jean to bring some water. \"It's no problem.\" He asks what the topic of discussion is again, and Kimball repeats he's investigating the disappearance of Paul Allen. Jean comes in with a bottle, and Patrick quickly puts a coaster down before she can put it on the desk. He tells Kimball he hasn't heard anything. \"I think his family wants this kept quiet.\" \"Understandable. Lime?\" offers Bateman. Kimball insists he's ok. He asks Patrick his age, where he went to school, and his address, the American Gardens building, which Kimball says is very nice. \"Thanks,\" Patrick says smugly. Kimball asks what he knew about Paul Allen. \"I'm at a loss. He was part of that whole Yale thing.\" Kimball asks him what he means. \"Well I think for one that he was probably a closet homosexual who did a lot of cocaine. That Yale thing.\" Kimball asks what kind of person Paul was. \"I hope I'm not being cross-examined here.\" \"You feel like that?\" \"No. Not really.\" Kimball asks where Paul hung out. Patrick names some places including a yacht club. \"He had a yacht?\" \"No, he just hung out there.\" \"And where did he go to school?\" \"Don't you know this?\" \"I just wanted to know if you know.\" Patrick tells him St. Paul's, then says he just wants to help. \"I understand.\" Patrick asks if he has any witnesses or fingerprints. Kimball tells him about the message on the answering machine, and that Meredith doesn't think he went to London. \"Has anyone seen him in London?\" \"Actually, yes. But I'm having a hard time getting actual verification.\" He tells him that someone thought they saw Paul there but mistook someone else for him. Patrick asks whether the apartment had been burglarized. Kimball tells him about the missing luggage. Patrick asks whether the police had become involved yet, but Kimball says no. \"Basically, no-one's seen or heard anything. It's just strange. One day someone's walking around, going to work, alive, and then...\" \"Nothing.\" \"People just disappear,\" says Kimball with a sigh. Bateman says \"The earth just... opens up and swallows them.\" \"Eerie. Really eerie.\" Bateman excuses himself by telling Kimball he has a lunch appointment with Cliff Huxtable at the Four Seasons in 20 minutes. \"The Four Seasons? Isn't that a little far up town? I mean, aren't you going to be late?\" \"No, there's one down here.\" Patrick promises to call him if he hears anything, and shows him the door.", "Patrick does stomach crunches while watching The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and then does some jump-rope.", "Nighttime. A seedy part of town. A blonde woman in a blue coat, a hooker, stands in front of a warehouse on a street corner. She has a face that says she's been hooker for too long. A limousine drives up. Patrick rolls the window down as the car stops in front of her. \"I haven't seen you around here,\" he tells her. \"Well you just haven't been looking.\" \"Would you like to see my apartment?\" She is reluctant. He holds out some money and asks again. \"I'm not supposed to, but I can make an exception,\" she says, taking the money. \"Do you take a credit card? Just joking.\" He opens the door and invites her in. The car drives away.", "Patrick makes a phone call on a large cordless phone. \"I'd like a girl, early 20's, blonde, who does couples. And I really can't stress blonde enough. Blonde.\" He hangs up. He tells her his name is Paul Allen, and that he's going to call her Christie. \"You'll respond only to Christie, is that clear?\" She nods.", "Patrick's apartment. Patrick pours some mineral water into a bathtub, where Christie is bathing and drinking champagne. \"That's a very fine chardonnay you're drinking.\" The song 'If You Don't Know Me by Now' is playing in the background. Patrick is dressed in a suit and bow tie. \"I want you to clean your vagina,\" he tells her. She puts down the champagne and picks up a bath sponge. \"From behind. Get on your knees.\" He tells her she has a nice body, playfully splashing her with water. The phone rings. It's the second girl in the lobby downstairs. He tells the doorman to send her up. He tells Christie to dry off and choose a robe, then come to the living room.", "He opens the door for the second girl, and takes her coat. \"I'm Paul. Not quite blonde, are you? More like dirty blonde. I'm going to call you Sabrina. I'm Paul Allen.\" He asks both girls if they want to know what he does for a living. They both say no, lewdly. \"Well, I work on Wall Street. At Pierce and Pierce. Have you heard of it?\" Sabrina shakes her head, and Patrick clenches his jaw. \"You have a really nice place here Paul,\" says Christie. \"How much did you pay for it?\" \"Well actually Christie, that's none of your business. But I can assure you, it certainly wasn't cheap.\" Sabrina starts to take out a cigarette. \"No! No smoking in here.\" He offers them chocolate truffles. \"I don't want to get you drunk, but uh, that's a very fine chardonnay you're not drinking.\" He goes over to the stereo and puts on a Phil Collins CD. \"I've been a big Genesis fan ever since the release of their 1980 album, 'Duke'. Before that, I really didn't understand any of their work. It was too artsy. Too intellectual. It was on Duke where Phil Collin's presence became more apparent.\" He goes and stands in the doorway of the bedroom, invitingly. \"I think Invisible Touch is the group's undisputed masterpiece.\" The girls follow him into the bedroom. \"It's an epic meditation on intangibility. At the same time it deepens and enriches the meaning of the preceding three albums.\" He tells Christie to take off the robe, which she does. \"Listen to the brilliant ensemble playing of Banks, Collins and Rutherford. You can practically hear every nuance of each instrument,\" he says, setting up a video camera on a tripod. He tells Sabrina to remove her dress. \"In terms of lyrical craftsmanship, and sheer songwriting, this album hits a new peak of professionalism. Sabrina, why don't you dance a little? Take the lyrics to 'Land of Confusion'. In this song, Phil Collins addresses the abuse of political authority. 'In Too Deep' is the most moving pop song of the 1980s,\" he continues, wrapping a scarf around Christie's neck while Sabrina dances in her lingerie. \"About monogamy and commitment. The song is extremely uplifting. Their lyrics are as positive and affirmative as anything I've heard in rock.\" He turns the camera on and points it towards the bed. \"Christie, get down on your knees so Sabrina can see your asshole. Phil Collin's solo career seems to be more commercial, and therefore more satisfying in a narrower way. Especially songs like 'In the Air Tonight' and 'Against All Odds'. Sabrina, don't just stare at it, eat it. But I also think Phil Collins works better within the confines of the group than as a solo artist. And I stress the word 'artist'.\" He goes to the stereo and switches CDs. \"This is 'Sussudio', a great, great song. A personal favorite.\" He walks back to the bedroom, unbuttoning his shirt.", "He has sex with both women at once. He flexes his muscles and admires himself in the mirror while doing them doggy-style. He makes them look into the camera. They do oral sex, then missionary. Patrick flexes his muscles in the mirror again. Christie rolls her eyes. They do more doggy-style.", "Patrick sleeps with a woman on either side of him. He awakens some time later. Christie's arm touches his. \"Don't touch the watch.\" He gets up and goes over to the dresser. The women get up and start to dress. He opens a drawer to reveal a collection of scissors, carving tools and other sharp objects. He takes out a coat hanger. \"Can we go now?\" asks Christie. \"We're not through yet.\"", "Some time later, he pays them and shows them the door. They take the money quickly and appear to be in tears. Sabrina's nose is bleeding. They leave and he closes the door behind them.", "McDermott, Van Paten and Bateman are seated in a bar lounge with drinks in front of them, discussing women. \"If they have a good personality and they are not great looking, who fucking cares?\" says McDermott. \"Well let's just say hypothetically, what if they have a good personality?\" replies Bateman. There is a moment of silence, and then all three men burst out laughing. \"There are no girls with good personalities!\" they say in unison, high-fiving each other. Van Paten says \"A good personality consists of a chick with a little hard body who will satisfy all sexual demands without being too slutty about things, and who will essentially keep her dumb fucking mouth shut.\" McDermott continues: \"The only girls with good personalities who are smart or maybe funny or halfway intelligent or talented, though god knows what the fuck that means, are ugly chicks.\" Van Paten agrees. \"And this is because they have to make up for how fucking unattractive they are.\" Bateman asks them if they know what Ed Gein said about women. Van Paten: \"Ed Gein? Maitre d' at Canal Bar?\" \"No. Serial killer. Wisconsin. The 50's.\" \"What did Ed say?\" \"He said 'When I see a pretty girl walking down the street, I think two things. One part wants me to take her out, talk to her, be real nice and sweet and treat her right.'\" McDermott: \"And what did the other part of him think?\" \"What her head would look like on a stick!\" Bateman laughs heartily, but Van Paten and McDermott just look at each other nervously. Luis comes up to their table and says hello. He takes out his new business card and asks their opinion on it. It is a nice looking card with gold lettering. Van Paten says it looks nice. McDermott is uninterested. Bateman swallows as a dramatic crescendo of music starts. Luis leaves and walks up the stairs. Bateman watches him go and Luis gives him look back over his shoulder. Van Paten asks about dinner. \"Is that all you ever have to contribute?\" snaps Bateman. \"Fucking dinner?\" McDermott tells him to cheer up. \"What's the matter? No shiatsu this morning?\" Bateman pushes his hand away as he tries to touch his shoulder. \"Do that again and you'll draw back a stub.\" McDermott tells him \"Hang on there little buddy,\" but Bateman stands up and goes up the stairs behind Luis.", "Putting on his leather gloves, he enters a bathroom with nice wallpaper and gold mirrors. He slowly walks up behind Luis who is using a urinal. Hands shaking, he slowly puts his fingers around Luis' neck. Luis turns around, looks at Patrick's hands, takes off one of his gloves, and plants a kiss on the back of his hand. \"God. Patrick, why here?\" Patrick is too shocked to say anything and he can't bring himself to kill Luis. \"I've seen you looking at me. I've noticed your... hot body,\" Luis says, rubbing a finger over Patrick's mouth. \"Don't be shy. You can't imagine how long I've wanted this, ever since that Christmas party at Arizona 206. You know the one where you were wearing that red striped paisley Armani tie...\" Patrick walks over to the sink in a daze and starts washing his hands, with his gloves still on. He looks like he's about to cry. Luis walks up behind him. \"I want you. I want you too!\" Patrick starts walking towards the door. \"Patrick?\" \"WHAT IS IT?\" he yells. \"Where are you going?\" \"I've got to return some videotapes.\"", "He rushes down the stairs. He runs into a man holding a tray of glasses. Looking up the stairs, he sees Luis make a 'call me' gesture with his hand. He leaves without saying a word to McDermott or Van Paten.", "Patrick walks down the hall to his office. He stops. Kimball is leaning over Jean's desk, talking to her about any reservations Paul Allen might have made. \"I've been wanting to talk with you, come into my office,\" Patrick says, shaking his hand. \"Jean. Great jacket. Matsuda?\"", "Inside his office. \"Do you remember where you were the night of Paul's disappearance?\" asks Kimball. \"Which was on the 20th of December.\" \"God. I guess I was probably returning videotapes.\" He looks at his datebook. \"I had a date with a girl named Veronica.\" \"That's not what I've got,\" says Kimball. \"What?\" \"That's not the information I've received.\" \"What information have you received? I could be wrong.\" \"When was the last time you were with Paul Allen?\" \"We'd gone to a new musical called 'Oh Africa, Brave Africa'. It was laugh riot. That was about it. I think we had dinner. I hope I've been informative. Long day. I'm a bit scattered.\" \"I'm a bit scattered too. How about lunch in a week or so, when I've sorted out all of this information?\" Patrick says okay. Kimball asks him to sort out exactly where he was on the night of the disappearance. \"Absolutely. I'm with you on that one.\" Kimball takes a CD out of his briefcase. \"Huey Lewis and the News! Great stuff! I just bought it on my way over here! Have you heard it?\" Patrick is stunned, and terrified of possibly becoming friends with this man. \"Never. I mean I don't really like singers.\" \"Not a big music fan, huh?\" \"No I like music, just they're... Huey's too black sounding for me.\" \"To each his own.\" Kimball closes his briefcase. \"So, lunch next week?\" \"I'll be there.\"", "Patrick and Courtney are having sex. Patrick orgasms, then rolls off her. He pulls a stuffed black cat from underneath himself, putting it on Courtney's lap. He gets off the bed and starts getting dressed in front of a mirror. \"Will you call me before Easter?\" she asks. \"Maybe.\" \"What are you doing tonight?\" \"Dinner at uh, River Cafe.\" \"That's nice,\" she says, lighting a cigarette. \"I never knew you smoked.\" \"You never noticed. Listen, Patrick, can we talk?\" \"You look... marvelous. There's nothing to say,\" he says, shutting her out. \"You're going to marry Luis.\" \"Isn't that special... Patrick? If I don't see you before Easter, have a nice one okay?\" she asks, with a hint of depression in her voice. \"You too.\" He starts to leave. \"Patrick?\" \"Yeah?\" \"Nothing...\" He leaves.", "A club. Androgynous men and women pack the dance floor. The song 'Pump up the Volume' is playing. Bryce is telling Bateman about STDs while in line to use private stalls for drugs. \"There's this theory now that if you can catch the AIDS virus by having sex with someone who is infected, you can catch anything. Alzheimer's, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, leukemia, diabetes, dyslexia!\" \"I'm not sure but I don't think dyslexia is a disease,\" says Bateman. \"But who knows? They don't know that. Prove it.\" Bryce snorts some white powder. \"Oh God. It's a fucking milligram of sweetener.\" Patrick sniffs some. \"I want to get high off this, not sprinkle it on my fucking oatmeal.\" \"It's definitely weak, but I have a feeling if we do enough of it we'll be okay,\" says Bateman. Someone leans over the divider. \"Could you keep it down? I'm trying to do drugs!\" \"Fuck you!\" says Bryce. Bateman tells him to calm down. \"We'll do it anyway.\" \"That is if the faggot in the next STALL thinks it's okay!\" \"Fuck you!\" says the man. \"Fuck YOU!\" says Bryce. \"Sorry dude. Steroids. Okay let's do it.\"", "A club balcony. The song 'What's On Your Mind' is playing. Three blonde women are seated across from Patrick. One of them asks where Craig went. Bryce tells them Gorbachev is downstairs and McDermott went to sign a peace treaty. \"He's the one behind Glasnost.\" Bryce makes a 'he went to get cocaine' gesture to Bateman by tapping his nose. \"I thought he was in mergers and acquisitions,\" she says. \"You're not confused are you?\" asks Bryce. \"No, not really.\" Another woman says \"Gorbachev is NOT downstairs.\" \"Karen's right, Gorbachev is not down stairs. He's at Tunnel.\" Bateman tells one of the girls to ask him a question. \"So what do you do?\" \"I'm into uh, well murders and executions mostly.\" \"Do you like it?\" \"Well that depends, why?\" \"Well most guys I know, who work in mergers and acquisitions, really don't like it.\" He asks her where she works out.", "On the street, Patrick and the girl are talking. \"You think I'm dumb don't you. You think all models are dumb.\" \"No. I really don't.\" \"That's okay. I don't mind. There's something sweet about you.\" They both get in the back of a cab. Somewhere a car alarm is going off.", "Patrick is lounging on the sofa in his office. He has sunglasses on. Between his fingers is a lock of blonde hair. Jean knocks on his door, and he quickly stuffs the hair into his shirt pocket. He picks up a paper and starts twirling a pen. She enters slowly, wearing a baggy brown coat and beige shirt. \"Doin' the crossword?\" she asks. Every line of the crossword is filled in with either 'meat' or 'bones'. She asks him if he needs any help, but he ignores her. She puts something on his desk. As she walks back to the door, he says \"Jean, would you like to accompany me to dinner? That is, if you're not doing anything.\" She says she doesn't have any plans. He sits up and crosses his legs. \"Well! Isn't this a coincidence. Listen, where should we go?\" She says she doesn't care where. \"How about anywhere you want?\" he tells her. \"I don't know Patrick, I can't make this decision.\" \"Come on!\" he says, chuckling and pointing his pen at her. \"Where do you want to go? Anywhere you want, just say it, I can get us in anywhere.\" She thinks for a minute. \"How about...\" Patrick flips through his Zagat booklet. \"Dorsia?\" Patrick looks up. \"So. Dorsia is where Jean wants to go.\" \"I don't know, we'll go wherever you want to go.\" \"Dorsia is fine.\" He picks up a phone and dials the restaurant. \"Dorsia, yes?\" says the man on the other end. Can you take two tonight at, oh, say nine o'clock?\" \"We're totally booked.\" \"Really? That's great.\" \"No I said we are totally booked!\" \"Two at nine? Perfect! See you then!\" He hangs up. Jean gives him a quizzical look. \"Yeah?\" he asks, taking off his sunglasses. \"You're... dressed okay.\" \"You didn't give a name.\" \"They know me,\" he lies. \"Why don't you meet me at my place at 7:00 for drinks?\" She smiles and starts to leave. \"And Jean? You might want to change before we go out.\"", "Jean looks out the window of Patrick's place. A telescope is pointed out the window. She's dressed in a pretty green strapless dress. \"Patrick it's so elegant. What a wonderful view.\" Patrick gets some frozen sorbet out of the fridge. Next to the sorbet is a severed head wrapped in plastic. \"Jean, sorbet?\" \"Thanks Patrick. I'd love some.\" He gives it to her. \"Do you want a bite?\" \"I'm on a diet, but thank you,\" he says. \"No need to lose any weight. You're kidding right? You look great,\" she tells him. \"Very fit.\" \"You can always be thinner... look better.\" \"Well, maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner. I don't want to ruin your willpower.\" \"That's alright. I'm not very good at controlling it anyway.\" He goes over to a kitchen drawer and starts running his finger over some steak knives. \"So, what do you want to do with your life? Just briefly summarize. And don't tell me you enjoy working with children.\" She tells him she'd like to travel and maybe go back to school. \"I don't really know. I'm at a point in my life where there seems to be so many possibilities.\" Patrick runs his hand across some stainless steel meat cleavers on a triangular base. \"I'm just so unsure.\" He asks her if she has a boyfriend. \"No, not really.\" \"Interesting.\" \"Are you seeing anyone? I mean, seriously?\" she asks. \"Maybe. I don't know. Not really,\" he says with a smile. \"Jean, do you feel, fulfilled? I mean, in your life?\" \"I guess I do. For a long time I was too focused on my work. But now I've really begun to think about changing myself, developing and growing.\" Patrick reaches into a closet and takes out some silver duct tape. \"Growing. I'm glad you said that. Did you know that Ted Bundy's first dog, a collie, was named Lassie?\" he laughs. \"Who's Ted Bundy?\" \"Forget it.\" \"What's that?\" \"Duct tape. I need it for... taping something.\" \"Patrick, have you ever wanted to make someone happy?\" She starts to put her spoon down on his coffee table. \"No! Put it in the carton!\" \"Sorry.\" He takes something else out of the closet and walks behind her. She repeats her question. \"I'm looking for uh...\" He holds up a nail gun and points it at the back of her unsuspecting head. \"I guess you could say I just want to have a meaningful relationship with someone special.\" His finger moves toward the trigger. The phone rings, and the answering machine picks it up. It's Evelyn. \"Patrick... Patrick! I know you're there. Pick up the phone you bad boy. What are you up to tonight?\" He puts the nailgun down behind the couch. \"It's me. Don't try to hide. I hope you're not out there with some number you picked up because you're MY Mr. Bateman. My boy next door.\" Jean sips some wine, looking at Patrick as she listens. \"Anyway you never called me and you said you would, and I'll leave a message for Jean about this tomorrow to remind you, but we're having dinner with Melania and Taylor, you know Melania she went to Sweetbriar. And we're meeting at the Cornell club. So I'll see you tomorrow morning honey!\" Patrick winces. \"Sorry I know you hate that. Bye Patrick. Bye Mr. Big Time CEO. Bye bye.\" She hangs up. Jean says \"Was that Evelyn? Are you still seeing her?\" He doesn't answer. \"I'm sorry. I have no right to ask that. Do you want me to go?\" \"Yeah,\" he finally says. \"I don't think I can control myself.\" \"I know I should go. I know I have a tendency to get involved with unavailable men.\" She asks him if he wants her to go. \"I think if you stay, something bad will happen. I think I might hurt you. You don't want to get hurt, do you?\" \"No, I guess not. I don't want to get bruised.\" She gets up and starts leaving. On her way out, she reminds him that he has a dinner date with Kimball the next day. \"Thanks. It slipped my mind completely.\"", "A crowded restaurant. Bateman and Kimball sit across from each other, eating some beef dishes. \"So. The night he disappeared. Any thoughts about what you did?\" asks Kimball. \"I'm not sure. Uh, I had a shower, and some sorbet?\" \"I think you're getting your dates mixed up.\" \"Well, where do you place Paul that night?\" He tells Patrick that according to his datebook, Paul had dinner with Marcus Halberstram, thought Marcus denied it. \"Does Marcus have an alibi?\" \"Yes. I've checked it out, it's clean. Now, where were you?\" \"Well, where was Marcus?\" \"He wasn't with Paul Allen. He was at Atlantis with Craig McDermott, Fredrick Dibble, Harry Newman, George Butner, and... you.\" Patrick looks up. \"Oh right, yeah, of course.\" Kimball makes a 'slipped your mind' gesture. \"We had wanted Paul Allen to come, but he had made plans. And I guess I had dinner with Victoria the following night.\" Kimball says \"Personally, I think the guy just went a little nutso, split town for a while, maybe he did go to London. Sightseeing, drinking, whatever. Anyway, I'm pretty sure he'll turn up sooner or later. I mean, to think that one of his friends killed him for no reason whatsoever would be too ridiculous. Isn't that right Patrick?\" he says with an eerie smile. Patrick smiles back faintly.", "Patrick takes a limo to the part of town where he met Christie. She's standing on the same corner. He rolls down the window and calls out to her. \"I'm not so sure about this,\" she tells him. \"I had to go to emergency last time.\" He promises that this won't be anything like last time. She says no. \"Just come in the limo and talk to me for a minute. The driver is here. You'll be safe.\" He holds out some money. Reluctantly, she takes it and gets in. He hands her a drink. \"Nothing like last time. I promise,\" he repeats. \"Alright.\" He tells her she's looking great, and asks how she's been. \"I might need a little surgery after last time. My friend told me I should maybe even get a lawyer.\" \"Lawyers are so complicated,\" he says, writing her a cheque. She takes it and bolts from the car. The car keeps pace with her as she walks. Bateman rolls down the window and whistles at her, waving more money. She stops and looks at the wad. She tries to grab it, but he pulls his hand back. He opens the car door again, moving over to let her get back in. \"Half now, half later.\" He closes the door. He tells her her name is Christie again, and that they are meeting a friend of his named Elizabeth. \"She'll be joining us in my new apartment shortly. You'll like her. She's a very nice girl.\"", "Paul Allen's apartment. Patrick breaks open a capsule of ecstasy onto a spoon, and puts it into a bottle of wine. A redhead woman in a white silk shirt and black jacket is sitting on the couch across from Christie. She tells her she looks familiar. \"Did you go to Dalton? I think I met you at a surf bar, didn't I. It was spicy. Well maybe not spicy but it was definitely a surf bar.\" She talks on and on in a self-important tone, neither Patrick or Christie really listening to her. Christie tells Patrick that this place is nicer than his other one. \"It's not that nice,\" he says. She asks where he and Elizabeth met. She says it was at the Kentucky Derby in 86. \"You were hanging out with that bimbo Alison Poole. Hot number.\" \"What do you mean? She was a hot number.\" \"If you had a platinum card she'd give you a blowjob. Listen, this girl worked at a tanning salon, need I say more?\" She sips her wine. She asks what Christie does. \"She's my... cousin. She's from... France,\" says Bateman. Elizabeth asks for the phone to call someone. She asks if Christie summers in Southampton. The person she's calling doesn't answer. \"Elizabeth, it's 3 in the morning.\" \"He's a god damn drug dealer, these are his peak hours.\" She says that the wine tastes weird. She leaves the man a message on his answering machine. She looks at Bateman when she can't remember where she is. \"Paul Allen's.\" \"I want the number idiot. Anyway I'm at Paul Norman's and I'll try you again later, and if I don't see you at Canal Bar tomorrow I'm going to sic my hairdresser on you.\" She hangs up. \"Did you know that guy who disappeared, didn't he work at Pierce and Pierce? Was he a friend of yours?\" He says no. She asks if he has any coke. He shakes his head. \"Or a Halcyon? I would take a Halcyon.\" \"Listen,\" he says. \"I would just like to see the two of you *get it on*.\" They stare at him. \"What's wrong with that? It's totally disease-free.\" \"Patrick you're a lunatic.\" He asks her if she finds Christie attractive. \"Let's not get lewd. I'm in no mood for lewd conversation.\" He says he thinks it would be a turn-on. She asks Christie if he does this all the time. Christie remains silent. He tells her to drink her wine. \"You're telling me you've never gotten it on with a girl?\" he asks Elizabeth. \"No. I'm not a lesbian. Why would you think I would be into that?\" \"Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing.\" \"Those are Sarah Lawrence GUYS, Patrick. You're making me feel weird.\"", "Some time later, the drugs having kicked in, and Elizabeth and Christie are feeling each other up on the couch. Patrick says wistfully \"Did you know that Whitney Houston's debut LP, called simply 'Whitney Houston', had four number-one singles on it? Did you know that Christie?\" Elizabeth starts laughing. \"You actually listen to Whitney Houston? You own a Whitney Houston CD? More than one?\" she laughs, falling off the couch. \"It's hard to choose a favorite amongst so many great tracks. But 'The Greatest Love of All' is one of the best, most powerful songs ever written, about self-preservation, dignity, its universal message crosses all boundaries and instills one with the hope that it's not too late to better ourselves.\" Elizabeth is still laughing. \"Since, Elizabeth, it's impossible in this world we live in to empathize with others, but we can always empathize with ourselves. It's an important message, crucial really, and it's beautifully stated on the album.\"", "All three have sex, Patrick on top of both of them. He moves his face down to Elizabeth's torso, and she starts giggling. Christie rolls out from underneath them. She watches them as they fool around under the sheets, and she starts gathering her clothes. A stain begins to form on the sheets: Blood. Elizabeth is screaming. Patrick looks up at Christie with blood on his mouth and a crazed look on his face. Christie runs out of the room, and Patrick chases her naked. She runs to a door and throws it open, to reveal a closet with two dead women in plastic bags hanging on coathangers. The full horror of Patrick's existence finally revealed to her, she lets out a bloodcurdling scream. She enters another room and almost vomits. Spraypainted on the wall is the words 'DIE YUPPIE SCUM' and the room is covered with blood and faeces. She backs out and sees Patrick turn the corner naked wielding a chainsaw. She cuts through a maze of doors and finally runs into a bathroom. She falls into a pool of blood next to another dead, naked woman. Patrick runs in, covered in Elizabeth's blood and starts biting her leg. She kicks him in the face and runs. \"Not the face! Not the fucking face you piece of bitch trash!\" She runs through the living room and out into the hallway, pounding and screaming on neighbours' doors, but to no avail. Patrick runs after her, stark nude, and chainsaw in hand. She runs down a circular set of stairs. Patrick reaches the top and holds the chainsaw out over the gap, waiting for the right moment. When she nears the bottom, he lets go, and the chainsaw falls end over end, finally hitting its target. He screams in victory. The chainsaw has impaled Christie through the back.", "Patrick doodles a woman impaled with a chainsaw with a crayon on a paper tablecloth. He hasn't touched his dessert. Evelyn is sitting next to him, asking him to commit to their relationship. The restaurant is crowded with middle-class looking people. \"I think Evelyn, that uh, we've lost touch.\" \"Why, what's wrong?\" she asks, waving to someone. A woman flashes a gold bracelet to her, and she mouths \"It's beautiful. I love it.\" \"My need to engage in homicidal behaviour on a massive scale cannot be corrected, but uh, I have no other way to fulfill my needs. We need to talk. It's over, it's all over,\" he tells her, scratching a red X over his drawing. \"Touchy touchy. I'm sorry I brought up the wedding. Let's just avoid the issue, alright? Now, are we having coffee?\" \"I'm fucking serious. It's fucking over, us, this is no joke, uh, I don't think we should see each other any more.\" \"But your friends are my friends, and my friends are your friends. I really don't think it would work.\" She tries to brush some food away from the corner of his mouth, but her stops her. \"I know that your friends are my friends, and I've thought about that. You can have 'em.\" She finally understands. \"You're really serious, aren't you? What about the past? Our past?\" \"We never really shared one,\" he replies. \"You're inhuman.\" \"No. I'm-I'm in touch with humanity.\" She starts crying. \"Evelyn I'm sorry, I just uh... you're not terribly important to me.\" She cries so loudly that the whole restaurant turns to look at her. \"I know my behaviour can be *erratic* sometimes...\" \"What is it that you want?\" she cries. \"If you really want to do something for me then stop making this scene *right now*!\" he snaps. \"Oh God I can't believe this,\" she weeps. \"I'm leaving,\" he says. \"I've assessed the situation and I'm leaving.\" \"But where are you going?\" \"I have to return some videotapes.\"", "Evening. Patrick stops near the lobby of a building to use an ATM. He sticks his card in the machine. Looking down he sees a stray cat. \"Here kitty kitty.\" He picks up the cat and starts petting it. A message comes on the screen of the ATM: 'FEED ME A STRAY CAT'. He tries to put the cat in the card slot of the ATM, but it pushes itself away. He pulls out a 9mm pistol and points it at the cat's head. A woman in a fur coat sees this. \"Oh my God. What you doing? Stop that!\" He shoots her in the chest and she falls to the ground. He lets the cat go. A siren is heard a block away, and a police car pulls up at the other end of the lobby. He takes his card and walks away. He tries to steal a car, but every car on the street is locked, and he only winds up setting off all their car alarms. He kicks the back of a Porsche and runs. Two police cars cut him off on the next street. They get out, guns drawn. \"Drop the weapon! Drop it now! Get on the ground!\" He starts to put his hands up, then turns the gun on the officers. They exchange gunfire. He runs behind a parked car for cover, firing and hitting one of them. He fires five more shots, and both police cars explode in a massive fireball. Stunned by his luck, he looks at the gun, then at his watch, and walks away. He breaks into a run, under the support columns of a skyscraper. He walks into the lobby of an apartment. \"Burning the midnight oil, Mr. Smith? Don't forget to sign in,\" says the man at the desk. He pulls out the gun and shoots him in the head. He runs past the elevators. One of them opens and a janitor gets out. He goes around a revolving door, back into the lobby, shoots the janitor, then out the other side. He runs into another lobby. Out of breath and drenched in sweat, he goes up to the desk. Smiling at the doorman, he reaches into his pocket and pulls out a pen, signs in, and goes up in the elevator, crying.", "He reaches his office. He looks out the window, then hides from the searchlight of a passing police helicopter. Still crying, he makes a phone call. An answering machine picks it up. \"Harold, it's Bateman. You're my lawyer so I think you should know, I've killed a lot of people. Some girls in the apartment uptown uh, some homeless people maybe 5 or 10, um an NYU girl I met in Central Park. I left her in a parking lot behind some donut shop. I killed Bethany, my old girlfriend, with a nail gun, and some man, some old faggot with a dog last week. I killed another girl with a chainsaw, I had to, she almost got away and uh someone else there I can't remember maybe a model, but she's dead too. And Paul Allen. I killed Paul Allen with an axe in the face, his body is dissolving in a bathtub in Hell's Kitchen. I don't want to leave anything out here. I guess I've killed maybe 20 people, maybe 40. I have tapes of a lot of it, uh some of the girls have seen the tapes. I even, um...\" He almost can't say it. \"I ate some of their brains. I tried to cook a little.\" He starts laughing. \"Tonight I, uh, hahahaha... I just had to kill a LOT of people!\" Crying again. \"And I'm not sure I'm gonna get away with it this time. I guess I'll uh, I mean, ah, I guess I'm a pretty uh, I mean I guess I'm a pretty sick guy.\" He's smiling. \"So, if you get back tomorrow, I may show up at Harry's Bar, so you know, keep your eyes open.\" He hangs up and tries to compose himself. The helicopter can still be heard buzzing around but is getting fainter.", "Morning. He showers and picks a suit from his walk-in closet. He goes to Paul Allen's place, putting on a surgical mask because of the smell of the bodies he left there. Opening the door, he finds the place empty and repainted white. Three people are talking in one of the rooms, and the floor is lined with cloth and there is a ladder and some other redecorating equipment. He heads towards the closet where he left two bodies. It contains only paint cans, ladders and buckets. He takes off the mask, stunned. \"Are you my 2:00?\" asks a well-dressed 40-something woman behind him. \"No.\" \"Can I help you?\" \"I'm looking for Paul Allen's place. Doesn't he live here?\" \"No he doesn't. Did you see the ad in the Times?\" \"No. Yeah. I mean yeah. In the times.\" \"There was no ad in the times. I think you should go now.\" He asks what happened here. She tells him not to make any trouble, and tells him again that he should leave. He starts to leave. \"Don't come back,\" she warns. \"I won't. Don't worry.\" He closes the door behind him.", "Outside, Bateman calls Jean from a payphone. He downs the rest of a bottle of pills while he waits for her to pick up. She answers. \"Jean... I need help.\" He sounds distraught. \"Patrick is that you? Craig McDermott called, he wants to meet you, Van Paten and Bryce at Harry's Bar for drinks.\" \"What did you say you dumb bitch...\" he croaks. \"Patrick I can't hear you.\" \"What am I doing?\" he laughs. \"Where are you Patrick? What's wrong?\" He starts crying. \"I don't think I'm going to... make it, Jean. To the uh, office, this afternoon.\" \"Why?\" She sounds worried. \"JUST... SAY... NO!\" he screams. \"What is it? Patrick, are you alright?\" \"Stop sounding so fucking SAD! JESUS!\" he screams, laughing. He hangs up, then tries to compose himself.", "Jean goes to Patrick's desk. She opens a drawer and finds a leather notebook. The first few pages have regular appointments. One page has a drawing of someone getting killed with a shotgun in the mouth.", "Patrick reaches Harry's Bar. He straightens his dishevelled hair and goes inside. Bryce, Van Paten and McDermott are sitting and drinking. McDermott tells him he looks wild-eyed. \"Rough day at the office?\" Bryce is drinking mineral water. \"He's a changed man! But he still can't get a reservation to save his life.\" Bateman tells them he isn't going anywhere unless they have a reservation. They discuss various restaurants. Bateman spots his lawyer, Harold Carnes, across the room, and excuses himself. His lawyer is telling someone how the Japanese will own most of the country by the end of the '90s. \"Shut up, Carnes, they will not. So uh, did you get my message?\" \"Jesus yes! That was hilarious! That *was* you, wasn't it! Bateman killing Allen and the escort girls. That's fabulous. That's rich.\" He asks him what he means. \"The message you left. By the way Davis, how's Cynthia? You're still seeing her, right?\" \"What do you mean?\" \"Nothing. It's good to see you. Is that Edward Towers?\" He starts to walk away but Bateman stops him. \"Davis. I'm not one to bad-mouth anyone. Your joke was amusing. But come on man. You had one fatal flaw. Bateman is such a dork, such a boring, spineless lightweight. Now if you said Bryce, or McDermott, otherwise it was amusing. Now if you'll excuse me, I really must be going.\" For some odd reason, Carnes keeps calling Patrick \"Davis\". Patrick angrily stops him again. \"I did it, Carnes! I killed him! I'm Patrick Bateman!

Why isn't it possible?\" \"It's just not.\" \"Why not you stupid bastard?\" says Patrick. \"Because I had dinner with Paul Allen in London twice, just ten days ago.\" \"No you... didn't.\" Patrick is stunned.

During the battle, the Death Star is revealed to be operational; its superlaser, revealed to be relatively rapid-fire on a low setting compared to its predecessor, is fired at the Rebel fleet and obliterates a Rebel star cruiser.

The fleet regroups and begins to engage the Imperial fleet of star destroyers directly.", "On the Death Star, the Emperor taunts Luke to give in to his anger. A ferocious lightsaber duel has erupted between Luke and his father. In the midst of combat, Vader reads Luke's feelings and learns that Luke has a twin sister. When Vader toys with the notion of turning Leia to the dark side, Luke gives in to his rage and furiously gains the upper hand in the battle, slicing off Vader's right robotic hand in a rage in one swift cut, and makes his father succumb to defeat at the mercy of his son's blade. Despite the Emperor's goading Luke refuses to kill his father, realizing that he is traveling down his father's path towards the dark side, and declares himself a Jedi.

He becomes challenged at a pool gathering that his wife and daughter sold off the estate months ago. He begins to shiver from hypothermia as rain sets in. Climbs a steep hill in back of the club's pool and finds the tennis court overgrown and the house locked and boarded. He collapses in his swim trunks in the rain. One of only a very few movies with a cameo by Joan Rivers and Kim Hunter outside her Planet of the Apes make-up.", "Merrill is clearly driven by inner forces. His friends are baffled by his determination to complete this quest, \"swimming home\", which we immediately intuitively understand. His passion is monumental, as are his oblivion and decades of neglect of those he holds most dear. His odyssey leads from love and power to despair and ruin.", "The movie begins, as the credits roll, with an unseen person moving among the summertime woods, in what we are soon to learn is a well-to-do suburban upper New York state neighbourhood.", "Soon the person, clad only in swimming shorts, is revealed to be a lean, lithe and tanned, middle aged Ned Merril, a one time stockbroker, socialite and ladies man.", "He approaches a domestic pool, dives in and swims three lengths, at the end of which he is met with an iced drink offered by Donald Westerhazy, who obviously knows him and invites him to come and say hello to his wife Helen. In the course of the conversation with them, it emerges they haven't seen Ned for quite some time. They, and their out of town guests; the Forsburgh's (also old acquaintances of Ned) , are all recovering from the excesses of a party thrown by The Westerhazy's the night before. The first hint that all may not be what it seems, is when Ned refers to his wife Lucinda and the two couples exchange puzzled glances, but continue to talk as normal, discussing other neighbours; The Grahams who have installed a new swimming pool.", "This plants an idea in Ned mind; to swim home using a string of pools across the county to his house. He explain the route will take him via pools of the The Grahams, The Lears, The Bunkers, a portage through the Patisons riding ring, to the Hallorans and the Gilmartins. Then down to the Biswangers, Shirley Abbots, across route 424 to the public pool and then up the hill and home. He exclaims he will call it the Lucinda river, after his wife. As he departs, Helen Westerhazy poses the question; \"Swim to his house, now why would he want to do that?\"", "Next Ned arrives at the pool of Howard (Howie) and Betty Graham. In the initial conversation with Betty, she explains how expensive the new pool was to get installed, but hints that money was no object since Howie is doing so well in his work. In the course of conversation with Betty it transpires that, when younger, Ned didn't think much of Howie and didn't believe he would succeed. Ned brushes this off as jealousy, saying it was because he was crazy about Betty, even though it emerges he was dating his future wife Lucinda at the time of Betty and Howard's wedding. Howie arrives on a new fangled, ride on lawnmower, which Ned feels compelled to fix the engine idle on.", "The talk turns to Ned's home, as Howie asks why he never put in a pool? Howie speculates that the house is probably still worth much more than Ned paid for it, with the tennis courts and all the planting done. Ned doubts whether he'll ever sell it and says he wants to see his girls married in the house, which causes puzzled glances between Howie and Betty. The arrival of the The Grahams offers a welcome distraction for an embarrassed Howie and Betty, who go to meet their guests as Ned resumes his swim.", "In the next scene, Ned emerges from the pool of the Lears to be greeted by a very hostile woman called Mrs Hammar. When she enquires what he is doing there, he tells her he is Ned Merril, a friend of her son Eric. When Ned inquires about her son it transpires that Eric is now dead and Ned didn't even visit him in hospital when he was in his final illness. Shocked at this revelation, Ned makes to leave, but is stopped by Mrs Hammar, who tells him that this is now her property and he is never to visit again.", "At this stage, it is becoming obvious that Ned is in severe denial, or is obviously running from a lot of things in his past. However, on spying a stallion in the distance, he soon recovers his old virile demeanour while racing against the horse.", "He next arrives at the pool of the Bunkers, where he meets 20 year old Julie Anne Hooper who, it transpires, used baby-sit his girls. He is amazed to see her all grown up and wonders why he doesn't see her anymore. To which she replies that they obviously don't need her (as the girls are now grown up). Nonetheless, Ned tries to book her for babysitting for the following Sunday night, which Julie thinks is a joke. The arrival of Julie's brother and his girlfriend adds a bit more to Ned's back story, where we learn he used drive a red Jaguar sports car and his daughter's names were Ellen and Aggie.", "Ned's enthusiasm about his swim entices Julie to join him and so they set off for the next pool. Along the way Ned remarks on the apparent changing of the season by referencing the flowers in bloom. Julie then confesses that she had a crush on Ned as a young babysitter to the extent that she once stole one of his shirts to wear.", "They arrive at the pool of the Bunkers where a party is ongoing. Ned is again greeted enthusiastically by many of the guests, even thought one of the ladies inquires if it is undiplomatic to ask about Lucinda, a question which Ned ignores. More hints of Ned former life of yachting and drinking Dom Perignon champagne are revealed. Julie becomes somewhat more flirtatious in a bid to show how grown up she's become. Another somewhat drunken male guest corners Ned to apologise for not calling him and says that he thinks it was a rotten thing for Ned to be ousted from his job like that by some new firecracker. Ned deflects the conversation and moves on with Julie to encounter yet another of his past conquests, a divorcee, Cynthia, who witheringly tries to dismisses Julie as competition. When Cynthia seductively invites Ned over to visit, he says he will need to discuss it with Lucinda which disgusts Cynthia. Another guest, Danny offers Ned the prospect of a new position, which Ned rejects dismissively when told he may have to take a cut in pay.", "As Danny tells Ned he doesn't have to pretend with him, Ned and Julie resume their swim and then move on to the Patisons riding ring. There Ned again impresses Julie with his athletic virility by jumping over the horse jumps, before over reaching himself and hurting his ankle in the process. Julie tells Ned some more about herself, which leads Ned to come on to her. Ned reveals that he married into money, that he was from humble origins and it was Lucinda who was rich. He then revisits the subject of his stolen shirt and possessively offers to be Julie's guardian angel, which spooks Julie and she runs off.", "Ned limps along a road alone and finds himself at the entrance to the Hallorans estate, just as a chauffeur driven Rolls Royce is driving in. Thinking he knows the chauffeur, he bums a ride, only to discover that the former chauffeur Steve has left. However, the new chauffeur also calls him by name. On the drive up to the house he discover the new chauffeur has been in his position for almost two years. He is the epitome of discretion (unlike, it would appear, Steve) and refuses to engage in discussion about Steve or much else either. Ned leaves the car at the front of the house and brings the newspaper for the Hallorans out to their pool at the rear.", "Sitting by their pool, it is soon obvious that the Hallorans are nudists. Mr Halloran is engaged in a conversation with their daughter on the phone, who obviously disapproves of their nudism and refuses to bring their grandchildren to visit unless the older couple put on clothes. As Ned approaches he removes his swimming trunks out of respect, while the Hallorans argue about refusing him if he asks for money. The three exchange petty conversation, which mainly reflects the Hallorans snobbery and the value they place on maintaining their privacy. Ned notices Mrs Halloran is organizing a safari benefit ball and tells her to put him down for a table. She balks and tells him a table costs $1,000. Mr Halloran interjects to tell Ned he was awfully sorry they couldn't be of help. When Ned replies he didn't recall asking for help Mr Halloran diverts by inquiring how Lucinda and the girls are. Chillingly, Ned retorts that Lucinda is fine and the girls are at home playing tennis and then takes his leave to go swim in the pool. As he leaves, Mrs Halloran removes his name from the list for the ball.", "Next Ned approaches the Gilmartins where he encounters a young boy (Kevin Gilmartin, Jr. \"after my father\") selling lemonade and practicing playing a recorder. Ned asks for a cup of lemonade and Kevin tells him it costs 10 cents. Ned tells him he'll owe it to him, but Kevin is skeptical, even when Ned says he'll drop it round to him tomorrow. Kevin relents however and gives Ned a cup, commenting that he is shivering. Ned inquires about Kevin's parents. He says his mother is in Europe on her honeymoon, so she couldn't take him and his father is in love with the manicurist (that's what his mother says). Ned notices the boy is lonely and says he'll invite him over to his house and he can play with Ned's girls who he says are not much older than Kevin. Kevin is excited at the prospect of this and of cycling his English racing bike. He offers Ned another drink but Ned says he hasn't time as he is swimming home. He asks Kevin if it is ok to use his pool and Kevin says yes but hesitates. Ned walks him up to the house, where he discovers the pool is empty. Kevin says they took the water out of the pool because he's not a good swimmer. Ned say he will pretend to swim the pool using all the strokes and invites Kevin to join him. While going up and down the length of the pool, Ned paints a glorious picture of himself, to Kevin, as a wonderful dad who floods the tennis courts in winter to turn them into a skating rink and says Kevin will have to join them next winter. Kevin is delighted at his achievement of having \"swum\" a full length of the pool. Then he begins to have doubts, but Ned tells him, if you believe in something enough, then it can be true. Kevin asks to do it again but Ned says he has to leave, at which point Kevin gets angry as everyone appears leaves him. As he walks into the forest Ned hears Kevin jumping on the diving board above the empty pool and returns, worried that Kevin will hurt himself. Kevin is puzzled when Ned says he was worried he might dive in, to which Kevin replies \"but there's no water in the pool\".", "Next, Ned arrives at the Biswangers, where yet another party is in full swing pool side, with people dancing, drinking and gorging themselves on caviar. Henry Biswanger is explaining to an audience of other men about the all-weather sliding cover over his pool, which will allow its use all through the year. Grace Biswanger greets Ned coldly, accusing him of gate crashing their party. Ned goes to get a drink and strikes up conversation with the bartender, saying he must be new, explaining he hasn't seen him at parties. The bartender replies that he hasn't seen Ned either. Another female guest, Joan, arrives to jump the bar queue before Ned. He talks with her about swimming. Joan asks is he a neighbour and Ned replies \"No\". She asks if he is a friend of the Biswangers, Ned replies that they are not even on his Christmas card list. He tries to entice Joan to come along with him, telling her he is noble and a very special human being. Another male guest arrives and takes Joan aside, obviously to explain to her who Ned really is. Ned jumps in the pool to swim a length and emerges at the other end as one of the catering staff wheels a hot dog wagon past. Ned recognises it as one he built for his kids. He gets quite emotional, loudly explaining its providence. Mrs Biswanger approaches angrily and explains that they bought it at a white elephant sale. Ned offers to buy it back, offering to send a check for whatever price they want, at which Mr Biswanger scoffs. When Ned threatens to make a bigger scene, Mr Biswanger tells him to leave. Ned does so, humiliated, but says Mr Biswanger will be hearing from his lawyer. As he limps away, all the party guests watch on.", "Ned next arrives at the pool of Shirley Abbot, an actress. When he tells her he is swimming home she tell him to grow up. It soon become obvious that Ned and Shirley have been lovers and that she has been hurt by Ned's behaviour in the past. When he tries to come on to her like old times she rejects him brutally. He tells her about the hot-dog wagon at the Biswangers and she asks how would she know it, that she's never been to his house. As he makes a drink, Ned exclaims to her that \"we are running out of Tabasco\". Shirley, irritated at his use of \"we\" says he is a little confused this afternoon, living in Never Never Land and inquires about his house (she's heard he's had a change of residence, which Ned denies) and Lucinda, whom she obviously dislikes. When Ned says Lucinda has always done a lot of good in the town, Shirley acidly replies that she just didn't do very good at home.\nNed begins to reminisce on their affair, recalling the previous winter in Toronto. Shirley replies that she hasn't been in Toronto for 3 years. She tells Ned that she wants him to get out of her garden, he asks is it because she is expecting someone, another male? When she confirms this Ned is taken aback and Shirley asks him if he thinks she's been in a deep freeze while he's been playing happy families. For the first time, we begin to see a real chink in Ned's facade, as he asks her what's happened and says that nothing's worked out the way he thought it would. She replies that he got turned out of his golden playpen. Shirley tells a story of once going to spy on Ned and his family on their way to the ballet and watching him schmoozing, smilingly with the hoi polloi, when hypocritically, one hour previously, he had been in bed with her. When he asks if her new man is better in bed than him she throws a drink in his face. Then she relates how he broke up with her by bringing her to a posh New York restaurant hoping she wouldn't make a scene. She says he sold her the yarn about having to go back to his wife and kids, even though he didn't love his wife (but the real estate was in her name!). She then mocks him about her affair with a bell hop to spite him further. He tries to entice her to come away with him to a castle in Ireland, but she again replies that she wants him to leave. He attempts to placate her and says he never meant to hurt her. His increasing shivers cause Shirley some genuine concern and she offers to drive him home. But he refuses and repeats the mantra that Lucinda is waiting for him, and the girls are at home playing tennis, as Shirley stares on in disbelief.\nNed draws her into the pool and tries to remove her swimming costume, but finally Shirley breaks and tells Ned what she really though about him; that he was a bore with his stories about his old deals and his old girls and his golf scores and his war stories. To Ned's dismay she says she was acting with him all the time, but he still tries to convince himself that she is lying and she loved it all.", "Struggling out of the pool, Ned is next confronted by route 424 and struggles to cross the six lanes of traffic, like a wounded animal. When he eventually succeeds he slinks away into the woods on the other side.", "Ned's next stop is the public pool where he pleads to be allowed enter, even though he doesn't have the 50 cents entry fee. He's resorting to begging when another couple approach and the man, Howie recognises Ned. Ned asks him if he will lend him the 50 cents and even though Howie's wife advises against it, Howie gives it to him. Ned is further humiliated by the pool staff, by being sent to take a shower and even being sent back again to wash his still dirty feet. Even then, he is subject to a careful inspection of his toes, akin to a criminal, before he is finally allowed to swim.", "He struggles to swim a single length of a pool crammed with other users and emerges seemingly exhausted by the effort. He is again confronted by Howie and his wife, along with another couple who are also less than impressed to see him. Howie's wife, frustrated at Howie's attempt at friendliness towards Ned, instead asks him when he is going to pay his bills? She is joined by the other couple, who echo the same sentiments. Ned promises to send them both a check the next day, which invites further scorn. The second male starts talking about the ostentatious orders he used deliver to Ned's house. Ned asks Howie how is his family and Howie begins to tell him about how well his oldest boy is doing, but is interrupted by his wife who says that they know how to bring their kids up right, Not like Ned, where it appears one of his daughters has been caught drink driving and Ned paid to keep her name out of the papers. Howie's wife continues to plunge the knife in further when Ned claims that his daughters worship him, by saying they laughed about him behind his back and when Ned accuses her of being a liar, Howie finally cracks and tells Ned the obvious truth, that his girls thought he was one big joke.\nStunned at this revelation, Ned pushes Howie aside and climbs up a rocky slope to escape the pool compound and their mocking of him.", "Ned finally arrives at the entrance to his own house and pushes his way in through the rusted gates as thunder crashes above. He limps into an unkempt and overgrown garden. As he walks through the dilapidated tennis courts, rain starts to fall and autumn leaves are piled in heaps. He approaches a once obviously grand, but now deserted house. He tries the front door but it is locked. He begins to bang on the door as rain falls in sheets and is blown by the wind. Through a crack in one of the windows we get a view inside one of the rooms of the house, empty save for some discarded boxes and an old tennis racket.", "This is revealed as Ned's true reality, that of the broken man slumped outside as the rain pours down on him."]},

When Jean's true identity is revealed, the boy, the headmaster and others are taken away by the Gestapo, never to be seen again. Semi-autobiographical account of director ", "'s life at boarding school during World War II.", "January, 1944 in Nazi-occupied France. From their Paris home, preteen Julien Quentin and his older, teenaged brother François Quentin have just returned to the all-boys boarding school at St. Jean de la Croix - a Carmelite convent - following the Christmas break. Outwardly, they are sent to boarding school because of the war, which is not to say that they may have been sent there regardless by their overbearing mother and absentee father, who they have not seen in two years as he works in Lille. Julien, generally looked up to by his classmates and respected by his teachers, likes to appear tough to his classmates, while in reality he is closer to being a scared little boy, a side of himself he is not afraid to show to his mother. A manifestation of the child side of himself is that he still occasionally wets his bed, something he hides in cleaning up before others awaken. The direct day-to-day issues of the war generally do not enter the school, and as such the boys are generally able to act like boys: they roughhouse (largely under the supervision of the teachers), and take advantage of getting care packages from home - which they are supposed to share in the Christian spirit - to trade with Joseph, an older boy who works in the kitchen, for things they really want, such as cigarettes. This term, three new boys enter the school, one, Jean Bonnet, who is the same age as Julien and as such is assigned to Julien's class. Jean is Protestant and is therefore exempt from many of the Catholic rituals of the convent, such as communion. Beyond his name being easy to ridicule (\"Easter bonnet\"), Jean is treated as an outsider by his classmates due to his reserved nature. However, Julien slowly begins to see in Jean aspects of himself, that familiarity which eventually blossoms into a friendship between the two boys. That friendship is strengthened when Julien learns the secret reason behind Jean being at the school. This term will also show Julien what the Nazi persecution means to general French life, events at the school which will be part of him for the rest of his life.", "At a Carmelite boarding school, rebellious twelve-year-old Julien is leading a safe childhood, protected from the horrors of war and the turmoil raging in German-occupied France. The arrival of a new student, the reserved but brilliant Jean, immediately sparks an intense rivalry between the two boys, paving the way for a strong bond, and a true friendship. However, more and more, Julien begins to suspect that there is more to his new best friend than meets the eye and that he is harbouring an unexpected secret; one that must be kept under wraps at all costs, as the Nazis arrive at their door."]},

The bartender recognizes Ringo from earlier days in El Paso and greets him. At a nearby table, a group of ranch hands overhears the bartender and speaks in hushed tones about the feared gunfighter and his deadly reputation. One of the men, a brash young buck named Eddie (Richard Jaeckel) resents the respectful attention given to Ringo and decides to test him.

He carries a bottle over to Ringo's table and aggressively insists that Ringo try the whiskey. When Ringo demurs, Bromley presses the point. Ringo dismissively insults the cocky young man and advises him to leave while he still can. When Bromley tries to push the issue further, Ringo coolly informs him that he is holding a revolver under the table, pointed directly at the young man. He orders Bromley to turn around and walk out, humiliating him.", "Meanwhile, the three brothers who are after Ringo have made it on foot to a relay station where fresh horses and guns are available for them. They saddle up and head for Cayenne, with the horses allowing them to arrive hours earlier than Ringo had anticipated.", "When a girlfriend tells Peggy that Ringo came to town expressly to see her and the boy, she is still hesitant.

Rooming at the hotel across the street from the saloon, the man keeps watch from a window and waits on his chance to get even. When Ringo and the deputy step through the saloon door, the man aims a rifle at Ringo, who fortunately sees the sun glint on the barrel. He quickly retreats into the saloon, sneaks out the back door, and climbs the rear stairs of the hotel. He gets the drop on the man and takes him to the marshal's office to lock him up. Finding no one present at the jail, Ringo locates the keys and does the honors himself.", "A comedic interlude ensues when a delegation of proper townswomen arrives at the marshal's office, led by elderly Mrs. August Pennyfeather. Mistaking Ringo for a jailer, they announce their demand that the Marshal and his deputies arrest the \"murderous\" gunfighter immediately. Flummoxed, Ringo politely plays along, identifying himself as a friend of Marshal Strett. As the women stridently denounce Ringo's violent history, Ringo stays in his jailer character and tries to defend his own past as if he were just an unbiased advocate for a presumably innocent stranger. He chalks many of the killings up to a \"misunderstanding.\" When Mrs. Pennyfeather sarcastically decries Ringo's \"50\" misunderstandings, Ringo protests and corrects the record down to 15 or so. They then accuse him of unfairly taking up for the murderous gunman. In response, Ringo lamely concedes that a case could perhaps be made for having the gunslinger arrested or run out of town. Another woman then demands that the killer be hung, with Ringo growing more and more uncomfortable by the minute. Just in the nick of time, Marshal Strett arrives. He answers the ladies' fervent demands for action by saying that Ringo will soon be on his way out of town without any bloodletting required. Mrs. Pennyfeather says she is satisfied to wait for another hour or so, after which time Ringo should be \"shot down like a dog.\" They thank Marshal Strett for his reasonable attitude before he gestures toward \"Mr. Ringo\" and suggests they thank him instead. Horrified, the chastened women quickly shuffle out of the jail.", "Strett now procures a fresh horse for Ringo and prepares to hustle him out of town. Just as Ringo saddles up, Peggy finally arrives to meet with him and delays his departure. He begs her to give him a second chance at settling down with her and the boy and she finally agrees to consider it if he is still alive in another year. Elated, Ringo asks to see his son before he leaves. While he waits, the three vengeful brothers arrive; one covers the saloon's front entrance while the others prepare an ambush from a hayloft behind the saloon, where Ringo's saddled horse is waiting. Ringo has a brief meeting with the boy and establishes some tentative ties. Finally saying his goodbyes, Ringo and Strett exit the rear of the saloon. Just as two of the three brothers prepare to ambush Ringo, Strett's deputy sights them from down below and aims his shotgun at them. They surrender and it appears that all is clear for Ringo's escape. He mounts up and starts to ride off. Just then, Hunt Bromley steps out from behind a wagon and shoots Ringo twice in the back. Mortally wounded, Ringo is helped out of the stirrups and stretched out in the alleyway. The smirking Bromley is dragged over to view his cowardly handiwork, and Ringo surprises everyone by saying that he drew first on Bromley, and that Bromley had beaten him. Strett objects to the obvious lie, but Ringo looks Bromley squarely in the eye and explains that by doing it this way he has condemned the young man to an uncertain, dangerous future as the man who got the infamous Jimmy Ringo, fair and square. Every young gun within reach will be out to earn a reputation by killing him. Ringo closes his eyes for the last time as Strett drags Bromley into a barn, administering a savage beating before running him out of town. Ringo's funeral, at which Peggy uses the name Mrs. Ringo for the first time, closes the movie."]},

Will they finally manage to fulfill their dreams?", "In a small seaside town in Italy, Moraldo Rubini, Alberto, Fausto Moretti, Leopoldo Vannucci and Riccardo form a group of idle friends that spend their time together doing nothing but drinking, flirting, and going to parties. When Fausto's girlfriend Sandra Rubini gets pregnant, his father pressures him to marry her. However, the irresponsible Fausto remains unfaithful to Sandra, cheating on her with many women and almost leading his family to a tragedy.", "We are introduced to an outdoor celebration to crown Miss Mermaid of 1953 in the small Italian town Rimini. The winner is the lovely Sandra Rubini (Leonora Ruffo) whose brother Moraldo (Franco Interlenghi) and mother stand by admiring her popularity. As a rain storm surprises the crowd and pushes them indoors we are slowly introduced to the men in the film that we will follow. Fausto (Franco Fabrizi) runs home in the rain and begins packing his bags when he discovers that his girlfriend Sandra, Miss Mermaid, is pregnant when she collapses at the party. Fausto is walking out the door only to be confronted by good friend Moraldo, who reasons that his sister needs a husband. With his father adding to the argument, Fausto decides to marry Sandra albeit apprehensively. One of the other young men Leopoldo (Leopoldo Trieste) goes home to write on one of his hackneyed plays but ends up spending more time looking at cracks in the ceiling and flirting with the maid in the next apartment while talking of one day staging his creative works. Then there is Alberto (Alberto Sordi) the animated goof of the group who still lives at home with his mother and attractive sister Olga (Claude Farell) who is clandestinely dating a married man who Alberto disapproves of. The five friends spend their days and nights attempting to create a good time for themselves and transcend their hum drum small-town existence. As we follow the friends we see them involved in different rites of passage as when Fausto is compelled to try to make time with every beautiful woman he meets and how this affects his marriage. We see Leopoldo meet up with an older renowned actor Sergio Natali (Achille Majeroni) who spends time asking the young writer to read his material for him only to discover that the incipient relationship is fraught with personal compromises. Alberto is heart broken and left behind to console his mother when his sister runs off the married man she has been seeing. As the high profiles of the five friends come into view and we see them go through many different escapades we see the effect that time and understanding has on each of them. Moraldo, the most thoughtful of the group spends time alone walking the streets thinking, where he befriends a young working boy who offers one of the most poignant farewells in film."]},

Five terminal patients in a Palliative Care Unit at Toronto's Grace Hospital share the last days of their lives and deaths with a film crew, having already given prior consent. They do so in the hope that their experience will be useful to the audience in managing its own fear of dying and death. Their families, friends and staff share in the task. Without narration or interviews, the camera simply and intimately observes the events that occur over the course of fourteen weeks as five people come face to face with the doorway through which we all must pass. While some pass suddenly, for others the process is unpredictable. Several die alone. The film traces equally the profound humanity, generosity and sensitivity of the staff at the hospital: with great gentleness and understanding they accompany each of the patients to their final moments. King's choice of subjects is equally moving: while the age of the individuals is hard to guess, most seem to be quite elderly, although ravages of their respective illnesses make it difficult to be sure: an Italian-Canadian grandmother, a stoic woman whose entire family has predeceased her, a former motorcycle gang member, a gay man, whose partner and mother and father comfort each other. Both the film and the hospital's staff allow every one of them to be themselves to the best of their ability and this aspect is one of the film's most moving qualities. It is a classic among the few documentaries that attempt to accompany individuals over their last days."]},
