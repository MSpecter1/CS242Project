A young woman at the front of the boat, clearly distraught for some reason, accidentally drops a bundle into the water, which Daigoro retrieves.", "Itto, meanwhile, draws his sword part way and notices in the reflection on the blade that some bamboo reeds are also trailing the boat. Itto is being followed by operatives of his mortal enemy, the Yagyu Clan; a constant threat that he can never ignore. Later, as Daigoro is relieving himself in a bamboo glade, Itto slices some bamboo stalks, causing some ninja assasins to fall from their perch.", "According to the voice-over narrator, this is a time in the Edo period in Japan when there are ronin, or at the very least a low-class of samurai termed \"watari-kashi\"; small bands of fighters who move from job to job, working from one \"daimyo\" (feud lord) to the next, depending on who's hiring.", "A group of four watari-kashi are idling along the road. Hot and bored, they spy an attractive young woman and her mother being escorted by a servant. Three of them run off to take advantage, but one of the band Kanbei, the more honorable of the four remains uninterested. The three knock the escort unconscious and proceed to rape the two women. The servant regains consciousness and is furious when he sees the triad violating his mistresses. He attempts to beat them with his bamboo pole, but is slain by Kanbei, who then also slays the two women to silence them. Kanbei then makes his three companions draw straws, saying the one unfortunate enough to draw the short straw will be killed to take the blame for the rapes and murders.", "Itto happens along this grim scene just as Kanbei is slaying the watari-kashi who drew the short straw. Itto kills the other two rapists when they attempt to attack him. Kanbei recognizes Itto and requests a duel. Itto accepts and they prepare, but at the last second Itto re-sheathes his sword and calls it a draw, leaving Kanbei to ponder his fate alone. \"You are a true warrior,\" Itto says, \"One I hope lives on.\"", "At an inn, it turns out that the young woman from the boat is to be sold into prostitution. Her pimp tries to have his way with her, but she bites off his tongue, spitting the bloody appendage onto the floor. The pimp dies from the injury.", "The girl seeks refuge in Itto's room, who steps in to protect her from the local police. But then the town's real authorities show up which are the local Yakuza, led by a young woman named Torizo. Some verbal sparring begins as Itto defends the girl against Torizo's threats. After Torizo pulls out a pistol and fires at shot at Itto's feet to indimidate him into surrendering the girl, Itto agrees to act as a substitute for the young woman and undergo \"buri-buri\", a form of torture that involves the subject being hogtied and hung in the air and repeatedly dunked headfirst into a tub of water. The subject is then beaten to unconsciousness by men wielding thick rattan canes and shouting \"buri-buri\". Itto endures the torture with his typical stoicism. This frees the young woman from having to work as a prostitute.", "Itto, still with a debt to pay for the death of the pimp, agrees to take on an assassination for Torizo and her father, a one-armed man that Itto is acquainted with from his past life as the shogun's executioner - acting as second during the execution of a daimyo who, fear-stricken, struggled dishonourably; Torizo's father had restrained the daimyo, sacrificing his arm to Itto's killing stroke.", "The target is a corrupt district deputy. Initially Itto is to face the deputy's personal bodyguards, one of whom is a sharpshooter and quick-draw artist who wields a pair of revolvers. Through cunning and guile (and the help of his young son Daigoro, who acts as a decoy), Itto defeats the armed man and takes his guns. The other is defeated by Itto in a sword duel.", "Itto's battle culminates in his facing the deputy's army perhaps 200 men singlehandedly. For the first time, the true power of the baby cart is revealed as it proves to harbor an entire arsenal of weapons, including spears, daggers, a bullet-proof shield, and a small battery of guns, capable of taking out many enemy soldiers like a heavy machine gun. All of the deputy's men are killed as Itto first takes out half of them with the baby cart's machine gun, and then takes out the rest with his sword and other weapons from the baby cart. The deputy is the last to fall when Itto, deprived of his sword when it falls out of his hands when he falls down an embankment, takes out one of the pistols he took earlier from the deputy bodyguard and uses it to shoot and kill the deputy. Itto then discards the gun and reclaims his sword, mumbling to himself that firearms are so uncivilized.", "Word of the fight has been passed to neighboring districts, and the ronin Kanbei shows up just after Itto has slain the deputy, and makes his demand again for a duel. Though battle-weary, Itto accepts the challenge. The fight is over in an instant. Itto is sliced across his back, but Kanbei is mortally wounded, impaled on Itto's Dotanuki battle sword.", "As Kanbei kneels to the ground, dying, he tells Itto his story and why he became a ronin a tale involving an ambush on his master's convoy. Seeing his side outnumbered, Kanbei seized an opportunity and ran ahead to attack the enemy head on. He surprised the enemy and prevailed in deflecting the hostiles, and saved the lord's life as a result, but since he left his lord's side, he was dishonored and expelled from the clan. He questions Itto whether he had done the wrong thing, and whether being a samurai means to fight and live, or to simply never leave the master's side and die. Itto replied that he would have done the same. \"I am glad to hear that,\" Kanbei says, who then asks the former shogun's executioner to act as his \"second\" in the act of seppuku. This Itto does with honor.", "When asked by Kanbei what is the true \"Way of the Warrior\", Itto replies that it is neither to simply live nor die, but to live through death.", "As Itto walks away, pushing Daigoro and the baby cart, Torizo begins to runs after him, but is stopped by her men. They implore her not to go to him, saying he is not human, but a monster."]},

Chuck Glover, a big city northerner, is the latest and probably last in long line of people hired to head a property acquisition field office of the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), the job which has taken its toll on his predecessors. It is a short-term job in that the dam is already built downstream with that section of the valley soon to be flooded. There is only one last property that needs to be acquired, an island in the river belonging to long widowed octogenarian Ella Garth, who has so far refused to sell. Chuck's superiors would rather he come to a negotiated settlement with Mrs. Garth than force her off the land, as they do not want the negative publicity of bullying an eighty-year-old woman. Upon Chuck's initial visit to the island, he finds that four generations of Garths still live there, along with a large number of black sharecroppers of whom Mrs. Garth generally takes care. As Mrs. Garth doesn't say a word in that initial visit, Chuck believes she may be senile. Although Mrs. Garth doesn't like what Chuck is trying to do to her, he finds he begins to have a deep affection for her. She is not senile but one of the most clear-headed and principled people he knows; she just has a special emotional attachment to the land where she has long lived. Some speculate that Mrs. Garth would not survive living anywhere else, a premature demise which Chuck does not want to see in his respect for her. What may be just as problematic for Chuck is the idea he has to take care of the black sharecroppers on her land, whom he wants to see treated as fairly as any citizen of the valley. This idea does not sit well with the white racist element of the area, led by the brutish Hank Bailey. Further complicating the situation is the fact that Chuck and Mrs. Garth's widowed granddaughter Carol Baldwin fall for each other. One of the complicating factors is that Carol is engaged to kind and caring Walter Clark, a man she doesn't love and would only marry for a father for her two small children."]},

However Wyatt and Billy also discover people attempting 'alternative lifestyles' who are resisting this narrow-mindedness, there is always a question mark over the future survival of these drop-out groups. The gentle hippie community who thank God for 'a place to stand' are living their own unreal dream. The rancher they encounter and his Mexican wife are hard-pushed to make ends meet. Even LSD turns sour on a bad trip. Death seems like the only freedom. When they arrive at a diner in a small town, they are insulted by the local rednecks as weirdo degenerates. They are arrested on some minor pretext by the local sheriff and thrown in jail where they meet George Hanson, a liberal alcoholic lawyer. He gets them out and decides to join them on their trip to New Orleans in time for Mardi Gras.", "Partners and friends Wyatt and Billy buy drugs in Mexico and sell them in Los Angeles, raising money to travel to the Mardi Grass in New Orleans on their chopper-style bikes. They cross the country on a musical ride through spectacular landscapes and encounter counterculture groups and experience small-town intolerance for their looks and lifestyle.", "The protagonists are two freewheeling hippies: Wyatt, nicknamed \"Captain America\" (Peter Fonda), and Billy (Dennis Hopper). Their names are a reference to Wyatt Earp and Billy the Kid. Wyatt dresses in American flag-adorned leather, while Billy dresses in Native American-style buckskin pants and shirts and a bush hat. Wyatt is appreciative of the help they receive and of others along the way while the Billy is often hostile, unappreciative and paranoid.", "After smuggling drugs from Mexico to Los Angeles, Wyatt and Billy sell their drugs to \"Connection,\" a man (Phil Spector) in a Rolls Royce. With the money from the sale stuffed into a plastic tube hidden inside the Stars & Stripes-adorned fuel tank of Wyatt's California-style chopper, they ride eastward in an attempt to reach New Orleans in time for Mardi Gras. At nights, they are forced to camp out in the fields, as no motel will lodge them due to their hippie and biker appearance.", "During their trip, Wyatt and Billy meet and have a meal with a rancher, whom Wyatt admires for his simple, traditional farming lifestyle. Later, the duo pick up a hitchhiker (Luke Askew) and agree to take him to his commune, where they stay for a day. Life in the commune appears hard, with naive city hippies finding it difficult to grow their own crops in a dry climate with poor soil. (One of the children in the commune is played by Fonda's four-year-old daughter, Bridget.) At one point, the bikers witness a prayer for blessing of the new crop, as put by one of the members: A chance \"to make a stand,\" and to plant \"simple food, for our simple taste.\" The commune also contains a traveling theater group that \"sings for its supper\" (performs for food). Free love is practiced and two women turn their attention to Wyatt and Billy. As the bikers leave, the hitchhiker (known only as \"stranger on highway\" in the credits) gives Wyatt some LSD for him to share with \"the right people\".", "While jokingly riding along with a parade in a small town, the pair are arrested by the local authorities for \"parading without a permit\" and thrown in jail, where they befriend ACLU lawyer and local drunk George Hanson (Jack Nicholson), who helps them get out of jail and decides to go with them to New Orleans for Marti Gras. George has a card for a whorehouse in New Orleans but states he has attempted to go in the past but never made it past the county line. As they camp that night, Wyatt and Billy introduce George to marijuana. As an alcoholic and a \"square\", George is reluctant to try it (\"It leads to harder stuff\", and \"I don't want to get hooked\"), but finally relents.", "While attempting to eat in a rural Louisiana restaurant, the trio's hippie appearance attracts the attention of the redneck locals. However, a group of teenage girls are interested in the strangers and their appearance and want to meet and get a ride, the local men including the sheriff make mocking, racist, and homophobic remarks. One of them menacingly states, \"I don't believe they'll make the parish line.\" Wyatt, Billy, and George leave without eating and make camp outside of town. The events of the day cause George to comment, \"This used to be a hell of a good country. I can't understand what's gone wrong with it.\" He observes that Americans talk a lot about the value of freedom, but are actually afraid of anyone who truly exhibits it.", "In the middle of the night, the local rednecks attack and brutally beat the trio with baseball bats while they're sleeping. Billy manages to scare the attackers off by pulling a switchblade on them. Wyatt and Billy suffer minor injuries, but George is killed. Wyatt and Billy wrap George's body up in his sleeping bag, gather his belongings, and vow to return the items to his parents.", "Wyatt and Bill continue on and finally arrive in New Orleans and find the brothel George had intended to visit. Taking prostitutes Karen (Karen Black) and Mary (Toni Basil) with them, Wyatt and Billy go outdoors and wander the parade-filled street of the Mardi Gras celebration. They end up in a cemetery, where all four ingest LSD. They experience a psychedelic bad trip infused with Catholic prayer, represented through quick edits, sound effects, and over-exposed film.", "Making camp afterward, Billy thinks they have made it and will retire rich in Florida but Wyatt declares, \"We blew it.\" Billy doesn't know what he is talking about.", "The next morning, the two continue on their trip to Florida. While on a quiet local road somewhere in Alabama, two inbred-looking rednecks in a pickup spot them riding along and decide to \"scare the hell out of them\" with their shotgun. As they pull up alongside Billy who is behind Wyatt, one of them lazily aims the shotgun at him and taunts him, asking, \"Want me to blow your brains out?\" and \"Why don't you get a haircut?\" When Billy gives them the finger, the hillbilly fires the gun at Billy, who immediately crashes and is seriously wounded. As the truck roars off down the road past Wyatt, he races back to his fatally injured friend, who's covered in blood, and covers him with his flag adorned jacket before riding off for help. But the pickup truck has turned around and closes in on Wyatt as the rednecks don't want witnesses. The redneck fires at Wyatt as they pass him, the bike breaks apart and the bike's gas tank erupts into a fiery explosion. Wyatt is thrown off his bike and lands by the side of the road... dead.", "As the murderous country boys drive away, the film ends with an aerial shot of the flaming bike and the body on the deserted road, as the camera ascends to the sky. The duo's journey has ended."]},

For the men in Barracks 4, all sergeants, have to deal with a grave problem - there seems to be a security leak. The Germans always seem to be forewarned about escapes and in the most recent attempt the two men, Manfredi and Johnson, walked straight into a trap and were killed. For some in Barracks 4, especially the loud-mouthed Duke, the leaker is obvious: J.J. Sefton, a wheeler-dealer who doesn't hesitate to trade with the guards and who has acquired goods and privileges that no other prisoner seems to have. Sefton denies giving the Germans any information and makes it quite clear that he has no intention of ever trying to escape. He plans to ride out the war in what little comfort he can arrange, but it doesn't extend to spying for the Germans. As tensions mount and mob mentality takes root, it becomes obvious Sefton will have to find the real German agent in their midst, which he finally does.", "U.S. Army Sgt. Clarence Cook, nicknamed Cookie, remembers back to late 1944, when he was a POW in Stalag 17, in barrack number 4 along with several other US army sergeants, and the one major problem at that time of what everyone in the barrack believed was a traitor among their ranks. Everyone in the barrack partook in most of the communal activities, such as trying to cause grief for their German captors - for example, in hatching escape plans - and trying to catch glimpses of the Russian female POWs at the adjoining camp, everyone that is except for Sgt. J.J. Sefton. The very cynical Sefton, with Cookie as his paid help, only looked out for himself. He ran a gambling ring and sold homemade alcohol made from potato scraps among other schemes, and got rich on what passed for currency on the inside, namely goods within Red Cross packages, primarily cigarettes, which he would in turn trade with the Germans for other luxuries. Seemingly no means of \"earning cigarettes\" was too low for him. But several incidents occurred during this period which made it seem like the camp officials, namely the smug Commandant Oberst von Scherbach, and the barrack staff sergeant, J.S. Schultz, seemed to know their every move, especially those which may have involved escape plans - none of which were ever successful - or Allied efforts within the bigger picture of the war, leading to the notion there must be a traitor inside. Sefton didn't really seem to care until HE was implicated as that traitor in a situation involving actions by US Army Lt. James Dunbar, who was housed temporarily at the stalag. Sefton then took it upon himself to identify the traitor, if for no other reason than to save himself from his increasingly enraged fellow inmates.", "One night in 1944 in a German POW camp housing American airmen, two prisoners try to escape the compound and are quickly discovered and shot dead. Among the remaining men, suspicion grows that one of their own is a spy for the Germans. All eyes fall on Sgt. Sefton who everybody knows frequently makes exchanges with German guards for small luxuries. To protect himself from a mob of his enraged fellow inmates, Sgt. Sefton resolves to find the true traitor within their midst.", "The American Clarence Harvey Cook, known as Cookie, recounts his memories of a German prisoner of war camp: 1944, somewhere on the Danube. There are 40,000 prisoners of war in the \"Stalag 17\" camp - Russians, Poles, Czechs and 630 Americans. The latter are all non-commissioned officers of the Luftwaffe and are tyrannized by the strict and cruel camp leader Colonel von Scherbach. One week before Christmas, the American barracks where Cookie lives plans and organizes an escape attempt by two men. But the meticulously planned endeavor ends fatally for them. When the two bodies lie in the mud during roll call the next morning, the barrack residents begin to wonder how the Nazis can always know about their well-guarded plans ... They suspect an informer among them. Suspicion quickly falls on J.J. Sefton, who had bet on the escape failing. He has long been viewed with skepticism by the others for his dealings with the German guards and his egotism. The mistrust culminates in a violent brawl that disfigures Sefton. His only way out of this hell is to expose the snitch himself, because it is not him. When Lieutenant Dunbar is brought into the barracks as a new recruit and confides to his compatriots that he blew up a German explosives train on the way, this secret also ends up straight to the camp authorities. When Dunbar is threatened with execution for sabotage, the search for the informer turns into a fight to the death.", "Captured Americans coping with life in a German POW camp in World War II are puzzled by the simplicity with which the Germans are able to stave off escape attempts, shooting those who try. Sefton () is a POW who has profitably wagered with his fellow American prisoners that these escapes would fail.", "The POWs fear there may be an informer in their midst, but who is it? As it becomes clearer and clearer to his fellow inmates that Sefton has considerable contact with his German captors, his fellow POWs mistakenly conclude that he is the informer and they turn on him, including physically beating him and helping themselves to some of his belongings.", "Sefton understands in full that to clear his name, he must determine the identity of the real informer, and he is, eventually, able to work out that Price (), whose English is impeccable, is a German informant masquerading as an American POW. Written messages, Sefton discovers, are being smuggled by Price to the Germans through a hollow chess piece on the chessboard in the barracks, with phony air raid drills staged to enable the Germans to retrieve these messages undetected.", "Now realizing that Price has figured prominently in the death of the Americans that have attempted escape, Sefton plots revenge, and, after exposing Price's true identity to his fellow POWs, he maneuvers to force Price to make an unauthorized exit from the barracks. To the guards manning the tower, Price's exit looks like an American escape attempt, and they shoot him, much to the dismay of Stalag Commandant Von Scherbach ().", "The diversion created by the shooting incident gives Sefton a chance to escape, and he takes with him a brave lieutenant () who has recently been captured. Because of the measures of success against the Germans he had gained prior to his capture, the lieutenant is a marked man, but he and Sefton are successful in their escape attempt.", "The elimination of the German informer and the first successful escape by American POWs lift the spirits of the other POWs.", "================================", "A few days before Christmas, 1944, at the German prisoner-of-war camp, Stalag 17, two American POWs, Manfredi and Johnson, inmates of Barracks 4, are preparing an escape. The story's narrator, Cookie, one of the prisoners, suggests that there may be a traitor among the men of Barracks 4.", "The men have secretly been digging a tunnel from their latrine to a point just beyond the barbed-wire fence that marks the perimeter of the camp. After going over their plan to sneak into Switzerland, Manfredi and Johnson get out of the barracks through a trap door hidden under the wood-burning stove and sneak into the latrine. They crawl through the tunnel and begin digging to the surface beyond the barbed wire fence.", "Inside the barracks, the men speculate as to how long it will take their comrades to emerge beyond the fence. They begin to predict that the escapees will make it all the way when one of them, a shrewd man named Sefton, wagers two packs of cigarettes that the men won't even make it out of the nearby forest. The other men, most of whom dislike Sefton, wager against him.", "Outside, Manfredi and Johnson dig to the surface and are about leave when they are spotted by a small German squad outside the fence, who open fire, killing them both. Inside the barracks, the remaining prisoners, including Sefton, are disheartened, knowing their buddies could not possibly have escaped. The hot-headed Duke demands an explanation from the barracks' security officer, Price. Price says he doesn't have an answer. Meanwhile, Sefton and Cookie quietly gather up the cigarettes that Sefton has won in the bet and store them in a footlocker Sefton keeps under his bed.", "The next morning the entire camp is awakened for roll call. Barracks 4 is overseen by Sergeant Schultz, a jolly man whom the men have absolutely no trust for. In the camp's muster grounds, the men are addressed by the camp commandant, Oberst von Scherbach. Scherbach tells the men that his guards successfully prevented the escape from the night before and that no man has ever escaped from his camp alive. He also has the corpses of Manfredi and Johnson lying in the mud and uncovered for all the men to see. The Barracks 4 chief, Hoffy, protests the treatment of the bodies and demands they have a proper burial. Von Scherbach agrees to do so. Von Scherbach goes on, saying that being caught outside the barracks after lights out means summary execution. Also, the stove in Barracks 4 will be removed so it cannot be used to camouflage the trap door the men cut in the floor and the men will also dig up the tunnel they dug and fill it in.", "Von Scherbach also announces that each barracks will be given a small Christmas tree and that all the prisoners will go through delousing. One of the prisoners, the shellshocked Joey, begins to play his ocarina, which is gently taken away by another prisoner, Stanislaus \"Animal\" Kazawa (Animal makes Joey another one later as a Christmas present). While the commandant talks and uses a mocking tone, Animal slyly throws the ocarina at the water in front of the commandant, splashing his highly polished boots with mud. The Commandant demands the guilty man step forward. Animal does and is followed moments later by several other men. Eventually, the entire prisoner population steps forward, covering for Animal. The Commandant, temporarily flustered, cancels the Christmas trees and tells the men they'll be deloused with cold water from the camp's fire hoses. The men are dismissed.", "After the men have the opportunity to clean up in their latrines, and following a small incident where Animal is nearly shot for crossing the barbed-wire of the camp while lusting after Russian female prisoners, the men go back to their barracks for breakfast. Sefton fries himself an egg in front of the other prisoners and when questioned about how he paid for it, he tells them that he bartered for it using the cigarettes he'd won the night before. The other men are quite angry that Sefton would use cigarettes he'd gotten as a result of the deaths of their comrades, however, Sefton counters, saying that many other prisoners trade with the Germans and that life in the camp is such that thievery is common. One of the other prisoners, the short-tempered Duke, tells Sefton that collusion with the Germans could get him hurt or killed and small fight breaks out. Hoffy promptly breaks it up and Sefton, claiming he has indigestion, gives the fried egg to Joey. Price, the barracks security officer, asks Sefton how he could be so sure that Manfredi and Johnson wouldn't make it to freedom. Sefton says he didn't know for sure but he \"liked the odds\" of the situation. Sefton also angrily tells his comrades that they're wasting their time and risking their lives unnecessarily by trying to escape. Sefton plans to ride out the war as a prisoner and stay alive.", "The barracks of the camp share a ham radio that they keep hidden and use to listen to the BBC and other communications about the war. The radio is smuggled throughout the compound by Marko and his partner, Steve, who is on crutches having lost a leg in combat. They use his empty pantleg to hide various items, including the radio. When the radio is brought to Hoffy and Barracks 4, Marko tells them they can have it only for two days instead of a week; the traitor in their barracks is known to the rest of the camp and the other barracks chiefs fear the radio will be discovered. The men set up the radio immediately, using a few yards of chicken wire as the antenna, which doubles as their volleyball net. One of the prisoners, Blondie, is a radio expert and begins to report about military actions in Europe; the news he picks up is about the famous Battle of the Bulge. Just then, Schultz arrives to seize the barracks stove and the radio is cleverly hidden in a pail of water. Hoffy and Duke try to grill Schultz about the barracks spy but Schultz refuses to tell them anything. Schultz also notices that a signal from the spy has been left for him; a loop has been tied in the cord for one of the bare light bulbs hanging from the rafters. After he barks orders for the men to report outside to fill in the escape tunnel, he goes to the chess board and takes the black queen. Pulling off the crown, he sees a small note rolled up and hidden inside. He exchanges the queen for an identical piece, pulls the loop out of the cord and walks out.", "While the men uncover the escape tunnel they dug, they notice a horse-drawn cart going by with the coffins of Manfredi and Johnson. The men all remove their hats in respect. Cookie narrates for a while about Sefton himself who, despite the poor conditions of the camp, has built a substantial entrepreneurship for himself based mostly on the trading of cigarettes. Sefton has several successful businesses at his disposal including distilling schnapps from potato peels, horse races (he uses mice that run around a small track), and a telescope that the men use to peek into the delousing shack in the Russian compound where female prisoners are disinfected. Hoffy, Price and Duke are not pleased with Sefton's ventures, fearing that the Germans will find out and punish them more harshly than ever. During a session where Sefton has the telescope set up, Harry Shapiro and Animal try to sneak into the Russian prisoners camp to look inside the windows of the delousing shack, using a pot of white paint to mark a line down the center of the road. They're caught immediately by a German guard and escape when they slap him in the eyes with the brush, making it back to their camp successfully as their comrades cheer.", "A new prisoner arrives; Lieutenant James Dunbar, who is being housed at 17 until the Germans ship him to the officers camp. Dunbar is greeted warmheartedly and comically by the rest of the barracks. However, there is instant friction between him and Sefton. Sefton, from the same suburb of Boston, tells everyone that Dunbar is from a wealthy family and should be pampered during his stay. Dunbar lets the first few comments go but tells Sefton that he can resent his family's wealth but he should tread cautiously. Sefton tells Dunbar that his family fortune won't protect him in the camp. Sefton leaves the barracks, to an unknown destination.", "The rest of the men ask Dunbar about how he was captured & brought to the camp. He was shot down on a bombardment mission and had been on his feet for three days without any sleep. He'd have been brought to Stalag 17 earlier but there was a major delay coming out of Frankfurt: a German munitions train was destroyed just outside the city and snarled much of the Reichsbahn transport for miles around. The sergeant that accompanied Dunbar, Bagradian, tells everyone that it was Dunbar himself that blew up the train. Dunbar is modest about the incident but tells everyone that he'd rigged a simple time bomb and tossed it aboard the train as it was leaving the station.", "Schultz shows up unexpectedly, telling the men they'll be getting new blankets. A visit from a representative of the Geneva Conventions is due to show up in a few days & the Commandant wants to give the appearance that the camp is complying with regulations. Hoffy scoffs and says that they know the blankets will be confiscated after the Geneva agent leaves. Schultz also confiscates the radio, playing coy for a bit before revealing it's hiding place in the bucket. He also sees that a new message has been left for him by the spy. He orders the men outside to get their blankets and retrieves the hidden message.", "After the men file back into the barracks they turn on Cookie, demanding to know where Sefton has been for the past few hours. With Hoffy's permission, Animal breaks into Sefton's footlocker & discovers a wealth of contraband that Sefton has been hoarding, including a cuckoo clock and silk stockings. Duke appears and tells them that he knows where Sefton disappeared to: he's been over at the Russian women's barracks partying with them. In a fury, Hoffy smashes Sefton's prized telescope.", "When Sefton returns, he finds the men staring angrily at him and that his footlockers have been broken into. Hoffy and the rest of the men suggest that he's the German spy they've been unable to identify. Sefton claims he's innocent and that the men should hold a kangaroo court. The Commandant suddenly makes an appearance and arrests Dunbar for suspicion of sabotaging the train that was destroyed near Frankfurt. Dunbar is taken into custody and the men become angrier with Sefton, immediately suspecting him. They turn on him and he is brutally beaten.", "The next morning, on Christmas Eve, the men are rousted out by Schultz to receive Red Cross parcels, brought by the Geneva agent. A mistaken shipment leaves the men with a large supply of ping-pong balls. Sefton is nearly unable to get out of bed and Schultz notices that he's been severely beaten. Sefton tries to bribe Schultz into revealing the identity of the traitor but is rebuffed. When the other prisoners walk in on them, their belief in Sefton as the traitor is reinforced. Hoffy tells Sefton that he tried to get Sefton transferred to another barracks but couldn't. Sefton tells everyone that he'll find out who the traitor is. Schultz walks in with the Geneva agent, who inspects the barracks and sees through the ruse of beautifying the camp: the blankets smell of moth balls & the meat promised in the men's meal is missing. When he asks Price and Harry about the conditions they live in, they both give non-committal answers but refuse to speak up about problems. When he questions Sefton about his obvious injuries, Sefton refuses to rat out his fellow prisoners. Hoffy takes the opportunity to tell the agent about Dunbar being taken to the Commandant's quarters without formal charges and the agent promises to investigate.", "At the Commandant's apartment, Dunbar is being forced to stand upright in an attempt to make him confess. Dunbar has held out but is rapidly becoming weaker with the lack of sleep he had while being taken to the camp. After talking a bit about how he became a prison camp warden, he places a call to his superior to let him know he has caught the saboteur responsible for the Frankfort train explosion. When the Geneva agent arrives, he asks about Lt Dunbar. The agent tells Von Scherbach that he cannot torture Dunbar in this manner without proof. The Commandant agrees and says he'll find out about the time bomb Dunbar allegedly used.", "Later in the day, the men celebrate with a small tree they decorate with their dog tags, smuggled to them by Marko and Steve. The men have traded Sefton's distillery equipment for the camp's phonograph and begin to sing \"When Johnny Comes Marching Home\". Price steals away from the group and sees that the cord for the light used to flag a message has been looped. Revealing himself as the traitor, he's able to switch the black queen for a new one. When the marching line of his barracksmates catches up to him, he enthusiastically joins them. Sefton, still recovering in his bed, notices that the loop in the cord is gone.", "Later, while playing horseshoes with Bagradian, Price asks him how the Lieutenant could have carried any explosive device with him through the German prisoner searches in the train station. Bagradian tells him Dunbar simply folded a lit cigarette into a book of matches. When the cigarette burned down it lit the matches, causing a fire that detonated the ammunition.", "That night the men gather around the tree and sing \"O, Come All Ye Faithful\". Sefton notices that the loop in the cord has reappeared. The solemnity of the evening is ruined when the camp lights go out & Schultz tells them all to evacuate and take refuge in the trenches used in case of bombings. Schultz waits until everyone leaves and begins talking in German to Price, who'd lingered behind to make sure the barrack was empty. He shows Schultz how Dunbar sabotaged the train using the method Bagradian told him about. After they leave, Sefton steps out from a hiding spot, having heard the whole conversation.", "On Christmas Day the men throw a party in their barracks with music and much of the liquor and wine that Sefton had been hoarding. Sefton talks to a suspicious Cookie about the traitor in their midst. Sefton talks about the potential consequences of revealing the traitor to the others & what punishment they'd face if they killed the man outright. Sefton suggests that a well-constructed plan to rid themselves of the traitor and appear blameless is needed. Cookie suggests that Sefton tell Hoffy or Price. Sefton takes the suggestion to heart.", "Hoffy shows up and announces that the SS has arrived to take Dunbar into custody -- his method for destroying the ammo train has been uncovered. Hoffy tells the men that they've come up with a plan to rescue Dunbar from the SS. All the men from the other barracks will disperse outside and help with a diversion. Sefton seizes the opportunity to demand that he stay in the barracks & be guarded by someone they trust -- Sefton suggests Price.", "Outside, the men have Steve drop a smudge pot crafted from ground ping-pong balls from his empty pantleg onto the mud near the SS agents car. When the cover from it is thick enough, also making it impossible for the tower guards to open fire, a small group of the men rush the SS guards and grab Dunbar, hiding him. The commandant is furious and runs checks of every man against their records. The barracks are thoroughly searched and the prisoners are forced to stand in the appelplatz for six straight hours, however Dunbar is never found. It is later revealed that Dunbar is hiding out in one of the water towers above one of the latrines.", "That night Hoffy calls a meeting where they'll collect everyone's dog tags, with the notable exception of Joey and Sefton, and draw the name of the man who will get Dunbar out of the water tower and out of the camp through the barbed wire. When the name is drawn, Price takes the tag and says he'll go. He figures that his work as barracks security chief has been less than adequate and he'd like to make it up to the men. Another trap door is cut in the floor and as he prepares to leave, Sefton steps forward and announces another wager that Dunbar will never make it out of the camp. The men are instantly furious with him but he slowly begins to reveal Price as the traitor: he approaches Price and asks him where he was when Pearl Harbor was bombed. Price slips up, saying he was having dinner at six in the evening, but in Germany, when America was getting the news earlier in the day. Sefton tells everyone that Price had sworn loyalty to his family's homeland and had gone back to Germany when the war broke out, he'd been trained as spy and was planted in the camp. Price tries to escape through the trap door but is easily caught and subdued. Sefton then tells everyone that he'll be the man to get Dunbar out -- he likes the odds because now they can use Price as a decoy. Considering that he'd sent Johnson and Manfredi out to their deaths when they tried to escape, Hoffy and the other prisoners are eager for payback. They'll throw him out the door with cans tied to his leg and he'll draw the searchlights and gunfire from the Germans in the guard towers.", "Sefton slips down through the trapdoor, bidding everyone a sardonic farewell and sneaks over to the latrine. He gets a freezing Dunbar down from the water tank and waits for the signal from his comrades. When Price is thrown out into the appelplatz he draws fire from all the towers, despite his cries for help in German. As he desperately tries to approach the commandant's offices, he's gunned down. At the edge of the camp, Sefton cuts through the wire fence and he and Dunbar escape into the woods. In the appelplatz, the commandant and Schultz first smile at the corpse lying the mud but are quickly chagrined to find that it's not Dunbar, but Price. In the barracks, the men reflect on how well Sefton's plan worked. The Animal suggests that Sefton merely wanted to steal their wirecutters. Cookie happily begins whistling the theme of the Army Air Force."]},

She has the nervous look of someone who lives next to a keg of dynamite, never quite knowing when it might blow up. They have one young son and one of Dave's small pleasures is being able to play stickball with his kid in the back yard of their modest home. Celeste is related to Jimmy by way of two street toughs, Val and Nick Savage (Kevin Chapman and Adam Nelson), so they are all considered family as they are all related by blood.", "It is not made clear what David Boyle does for a living, and the same goes for the two Savage brothers, both of whom consider Jimmy to be their godfather of sorts and thus are always available to do his bidding.", "Saturday night comes and goes and Jimmy wakes up at home on a sunny Sunday morning, the morning of his middle daughter's first communion. He goes to Katie's room to make sure that she has left for her work shift at his store, and is disturbed to see that her bed does not look like it has been slept in. Upon inquiry, the mart assistant tells Jimmy that he wishes Katie had been there as he is swamped by all the after church Sunday business.", "Jimmy's concern turns to fear and worry when Katie's car is discovered unoccupied at Pen Park, a nearby park and playground for the area's inhabitants. Blood is discovered on the front seat but Katie is nowhere to be found. Police are quickly called and they cordon off the area. The local television stations are not far behind and suddenly the news is filled with stories about this poor missing young girl.", "Sean Devine (Kevin Bacon), the third member of the trio, has done the most to get away from their shared sordid past and the psychological chains of being associated with Boyle's kidnaping and rape. He does not live in the area, but is now a homicide detective who works the Mystic River beat with his partner, Whitey Powers (Laurence Fishburne).", "Sean has a wife who has either left him or been pushed away by him and is now so damaged that all she can do is call him on his cell phone without ever being able to say anything. Sean goes through the routine as he knows exactly who is always calling him. He loves her and still holds out faint hope that they might somehow be able to reconcile in spite of all evidence to the contrary.", "A police search eventually turns up Katie's body lying half buried in the underbrush of an old well basin in the park. In a blind rage, Jimmy has to be held back by half a dozen policemen. He later demands to see the body of his daughter in the morgue when he brings over a dress for her body for the funeral. He stares in silence at her as her face and her hair are once again beautifully made up. He wants to hug her and smother her in kisses, but he realizes that this is no longer possible. Her body is there, but his Katie isn't.", "Dave Boyle has problems of his own. He is at a local bar with a friend when Katie and two of her friends, obviously drunk and in high spirits, come into the bar late on that Saturday night and surprise the patrons by dancing together on top of the bar. Much later that night he comes home to a very worried Celeste with a bashed hand and sporting a shirt and jacket both soaked in blood.", "He tells her that he was mugged on the way to his car and is afraid that he might have killed the man in self-defense.", "Dave later changes his story as to how his hand got mangled when he is interviewed by Whitey and Sean. Meanwhile, Celeste remains glued to the television set waiting to hear something about that guy who was supposedly killed by her husband, but it is only the circumstances surrounding Katie's death that fills the local newscasts. She loves Dave and wants to believe his story, but without any corroborating evidence she has trouble avoiding the obvious conclusion that there is a link between his suspicious activity and Katie's murder as they both occurred at the same time on the same night.", "Whitey Powers isn't for a moment fooled by Dave's alibi for his mangled hand. He is also convinced that his injury is a possible link to Katie's murder, especially since Boyle was one of the last people to see her alive. His hope is that this link will be discovered upon further investigation.", "Sean Devine, his partner in homicide investigations but his superior as an officer and a college graduate, feels instead that Boyle may be innocent. He knows him too well to believe Boyle to be capable of doing this. Later a link is discovered on a computer check between that bullet in the car seat and a robbery committed many years before at a liquor store. The markings match, but the gun, originally owned by Brendan Harris's dad, is nowhere to be found.", "Furthermore, this link is highly tenuous as Harris's dad had deserted his family more than a decade before and has not been seen since. Whitey voices his suspicions, quickly disclaimed by Sean, that his involvement with all the principles in the case just might be clouding his judgment.", "Then the two homicide detectives find out that Jimmy Markum has sent the Savage brothers out to investigate all the potential suspects in the case, and now the race is on for Sean and Whitey to find the perpetrator before Jimmy finds him and metes out his own brand of street justice. The two obvious leads, Dave Boyle and Brendan Harris, are investigated in a methodical police detective manner. Even the Savage brothers are forced to admit to Jimmy Markum that Sean and Whitey are doing their jobs well in covering all the bases.", "They check out the Harris home and interview Brendan about his relationship with Katie. It is obvious to both detectives that Brendan truly loved Katie and is innocent of her murder. In point of fact, several of the items found in Katie's purse had to do with Las Vegas tourist destinations. It comes out that Brendan and Katie were going to fly to Las Vegas and elope the next day. This explains the funny feeling that Jimmy had when Katie said goodnight to him the day before. His life in prison had given him an extra sensory perception about the way people look when they talk, and it struck him that she was saying more than \"Good Night,\" more like \"Goodbye\" perhaps.", "All during the interview in the Harris's home Brendan's mother (Jenny O'Hara) is hovering in the background filling the room with a dark cloud of repressed rage and bitterness. Her husband deserted her 14 years before, and she doesn't want to see anyone else succeed at love. Besides, she hates the police as her husband had also been a crook. A curious fact eventually comes out that Brendan believes his father to be still alive as his mother receives a check for $500 every month mailed from a post office in Brooklyn.", "Sean and Whitey go back to their police station and do some background work on Brendan's father in an effort to trace the missing gun. His father was caught smuggling goods across a state line in a stolen auto and thus was picked up by the FBI. Surprisingly enough, however, he was never convicted of anything. They go over to the New York FBI office to find out the background information on this case and all of a sudden the threads start to weave a cloth of closure. Brendan's dad never served any time because he ratted to the FBI on other illegal activities taking place at the same time, in fact, the illegal activities of Jimmy Markum.", "So Jimmy Markum took the fall and went to prison for two years, a stretch that left him in prison during the death of his first wife. Even though Harris's dad gave testimony in confidence to the FBI, he disappeared right after Markum was released from prison. Of course, there was never a provable connection; Harris just disappeared off the face of the earth. The only thing left to give some small evidence as to his still being alive is the monthly arrival of those checks for $500 to Mrs. Harris. But then there is that intense hatred for Harris's son so inexplicably felt by all emanating from Jimmy Markum.", "Their next stop is at the liquor store still owned by the same man (Eli Wallach, uncredited) who had been held up years before. The gun was fired during the robbery and the bullet had lodged in the wall between the bottles of liquor. This bullet was retrieved as part of the investigation and the markings were later added to the police computer files. Now a bullet with the exact same markings is found buried in the seat of Katie's car.", "The aged liquor store owner told the two cops that, Yeah, he knew who did it, but bitterly complains that the proof would never have held up in court. Harris's dad came in three weeks after the robbery and smiled at him with such a knowing smile as if to say, \"Aha, I pulled a fast one on you, didn't I?\" And how can you convict a man on a look? Now, all of a sudden, the Harris gun assumes a critical importance in this case. Where is it and who knows about it?", "\"Mystic River\" takes a final explosive turn into a complex double denouement that involves both the gun as a murder weapon and an explanation of the suspicious activities of Dave Boyle the night of Katie's murder.", "Dave's car had been impounded because of the blood stains in the front seat. While these blood stains turn out to belong to Dave, the shocker is that different blood stains are found in the trunk, blood stains that match the blood type of Katie Markum. Sean and Whitey make another visit to Celeste Boyle and present her with this apparently damning evidence in an effort to break her alibi for her husband. Celeste has always maintained that Dave came home when he said he did, which was shortly before one in the morning. In actuality, he had come home closer to three in the morning. Celeste doesn't change her story to the policemen, but the doubts in her own mind as to her husband's innocence grow ever larger.", "This makes his comments to her about what happened to \"poor Katie\" all the more strange. Late one night he walks over past Jimmy's house and finds Jimmy sitting on the front stoop. Jimmy remarks to Dave, \"You know, this is where I used to wait for my Katie to come home.\" Once again, Dave offers his sincerest condolences. \"Just terrible,\" he says.", "The next day the two appropriately named Savage brothers, who apparently have an in with the police department, report to Jimmy that blood matching Katie's blood type was found in the trunk of Dave's car.", "In Jimmy's mind, this convicts Dave beyond a shadow of a doubt in spite of the fact that the events of the crime do not match this placement. Katie was first shot in her car and she then fled her car into Pen Park in a desperate attempt to escape her murderer. A trail of her blood and torn pieces of her clothing were found leading from her car to the well pit in the park where her body was found. The geographical events of her death are seemingly beyond dispute and they do tend to throw considerable doubt on the possibility of Dave Boyle or his car having anything to do with her death.", "But this is not something that the hotheaded Jimmy Markum is going to examine in a cool analytical light. He goes over to visit Celeste later that evening and finds her crying on her front porch. The two police detectives have just left and Celeste is now convinced that her husband is guilty of this horrible crime. Jimmy holds her and hugs her and comforts her in a successful effort to get her to admit as much. \"You think Dave killed my Katie, don't you?\" he asks her, and Celeste sadly and tearfully nods.", "Markum instructs the Savage brothers to pick up Boyle and go through \"the procedure.\" The next afternoon they are cruising down the street when they spy Boyle walking along the sidewalk. They invite him into their car to go for a drink, even though it is still early in the afternoon. Dave protests that it is too early to start drinking, but he doesn't want to appear antisocial. He climbs into the back seat of the Savage's sedan and once again, just like 25 years before, he looks wistfully out of the rear window of the car at the old neighborhood that has been his only home for all his life. Perhaps he instinctively realizes that he will never see his home again...", "The Savages bring him to a seedy waterfront bar in an isolated area of town and proceed to get him drunk. Hours later Jimmy Markum joins the three at their booth in this poorly lit bar. Everyone is all smiles and camaraderie but a dark tension lurks just under the surface of their overt affability.", "Dave reaches his limit and confesses that he has to go outside and throw up. They let him leave and then shortly join him as he is puking by the bank of the river. Jimmy then tells Dave Boyle that this is where he killed Harris years before for sending him to prison. And he will do the same to Boyle if he killed his daughter, Katie.", "But Boyle protests his innocence. \"What about the blood in your trunk?\" they ask. Boyle slurs his speech as he tells his side of the story. He came out of the bar late that Saturday night and stumbled upon a pedophile raping a young kid in a car in the parking lot of the tavern. He told the kid to get away as he pulled the man out of the car and pounded him into a bloody pulp in a drunken rage. He then put the unconscious, perhaps even dead, body in the trunk of his car and dumped it behind the bar.", "This story is unconvincing to Jimmy Markum as no body has yet been found to verify Boyle's story. He has the Savage brothers beat him up some more and then tells Boyle that he will only let him live if he tells the truth about murdering his daughter. By now, drunk, sick, sore, and nearly unconscious, Boyle decides that the easiest thing for him to do is to accept Markum's offer and live. He says, \"Yeah, I did it,\" whereupon Markum knifes him in the stomach and then shoots a bullet into the near dead body as it lies on the ground...", "Back to Sean and Whitey and the still missing Harris gun. They have been pressuring Brendan Harris just as they have been pressuring Boyle for a clue to provide a break in the case. After being hauled down to the police station twice for interrogation, Sean grabs Brendan and breaks the news to the shocked kid that his missing father's gun is the murder weapon of his beloved Katie, the girl with whom he was planning to elope to Las Vegas.", "Brendan doesn't say anything about this to the policemen, but as soon as he gets home he goes to a secret hiding place in the ceiling of his family's kitchen and feels around for the hidden gun. He is shocked to find that the gun is not there.", "All of a sudden everything starts to become clear to this poor, innocent young man. His deaf mute brother, who was aware of his plans to elope with Katie, must have been involved as he was the only one who knew where that gun was hidden and, besides, he hated the thought of losing his beloved brother whom he depended upon so much for protection and friendship.", "Brendan's younger brother shortly comes home with his best friend, and Brendan says, \"Oh, it's you again.\" He then accuses his brother of murdering Katie. It wasn't supposed to turn out that way, his brother signs, but everything got out of control. I just meant to scare her. Terrified as Brendan rushes him in a rage and starts to throttle him, he pulls the gun out just as Sean Devine and Whitey Powers rush into the house. Sean acts quickly enough to grab the gun and subdue the young man just as the gun fires a misdirected bullet into the ceiling", "The case of the lovely young girl who was murdered is now solved. Unfortunately, the pathetic victim from a crime from many years before has also paid with his life.", "Sean once again gets a silent call from his ex-wife. \"Look,\" he says, \"I am sorry I pushed you away.\" \"I'm sorry, too,\" she finally speaks. A look of joy spreads over Sean's face. There is hope, after all.", "It is the day of the annual neighborhood parade, but Jimmy is in a morose mood in his bedroom. Annabeth comes in and tells him that the police have solved the case and have caught his daughter's killers. He confesses to her that he has killed an innocent man. \"I killed an innocent man,\" he repeats again. \"Look,\" Annabeth replies, \"you did your best. What's past is past, and you can't change it. She also despises Celeste for suspecting her own husband and expressing her doubts to Jimmy.", "It is clear that she is going to stand by her man no matter what. \"I am going to take you down here and then we are going to go out and enjoy the parade,\" as she drags him down to the bed on top of her. They make love, perhaps for the first time since Katie's murder.", "Sean, who has figured everything out by now, sees Jimmy and asks him, \"Do you know where Dave Boyle is? We found the body of a man behind the bar and we want to talk to him about it.\" Jimmy lifts his hands up as if to say that he hasn't seen Boyle and doesn't have a clue as to where he might be. Sean isn't fooled. After a lifetime spent in this neighborhood he knows what the score is. \"Are you now going to be sending $500 to Celeste Boyle every month for the rest of her life?\" he asks. Jimmy smiles, but says nothing. He also knows that Sean knows.", "The parade is going down the street with all the hoopla and the noise and the marching bands playing their music. The Markum family minus one beloved daughter sits together on one front stoop watching the parade go by. Sean, once again together with his wife and child, sits across the street all aglow with renewed hope at his new chance for marital happiness. He holds his hand up in the form of a gun and goes \"Kapow!\" to his old childhood friend, Jimmy, across the street. Jimmy just smiles.", "The young Boyle child looking strangely uncomfortable and out of place rides by on a float with the other members of his little league team. Meanwhile, Celeste walks up and down the street looking every which way in sheer desperation and a failing hope for her missing husband, a search that she instinctively realizes will be fruitless.", "She knows how the system of street justice works. She didn't mean it, but her lack of marital loyalty betrayed her husband and this action on her part condemned an innocent man to death. Her family blood was not thick enough to save him, not that it ever would have been in a case like this.", "Dave Boyle would still be alive if only she had kept her mouth shut for another 24 hours. His childhood had been stolen from him and now his adulthood was also taken from him. In both instances he was the innocent victim of the illegal machinations of others."]},

When he warns that the perpetrators could rape other nuns, she instructs Lieutenant to pray on the matter. After she leaves, Lieutenant falls to the church floor and wails. He sees Jesus Christ standing before him, curses God, and throws a rosary at the hallucination. Lieutenant laments his life, accusing God of abandoning him. Through screams and tears, he apologizes for his many sins, and begs God for forgiveness. When the illusion disappears, Lieutenant finds himself kissing the feet of an old black woman. He leaves the church with her where she tells him who raped the nun from a brass chalet. The woman says that on the previous day, two Hispanic youths came into the pawn shop where her husband works and attempted to pawn a chalet for cash, which the woman recognized as being from the very same church because she is a regular attendee. The elderly black woman takes the Lieutenant down the street and points out the apartment building where the two thugs reside since they also gave their address when they pawned the stolen items from the church.", "The Lieutenant goes to a drug house down the street from the church to arrest the two Hispanics who raped the Nun. Handcuffing the youths, he holds them at gunpoint and smokes \"crack\" with them, while watching the baseball game on television. The Mets finally win, but Lieutenant does not react to the good news. He escorts the youths to Port Authority Bus Terminal, cursing them along the way. He forces them to board a bus and never return, and gives them his box with the $30,000 and tells the two punks that he forgives them for raping the Nun.

He changes his mind about Alice and Vicky, for whom he will choose husbands although they've also chosen the men they'd marry if they could. However, Henry won't provide them with dowries, which might be a challenge in finding them men he would consider suitable husbands. He considers Maggie far too useful to him as the overly-efficient, organized one, so doesn't intend to let her go--besides, at age 30, she's too old for any man to want anyway. Incensed by her father's attitude, Maggie decides to show him how wrong he is about her being an unmarriageable spinster by proposing to timid Willie Mossop, the shop's poor, uneducated, illiterate boot hand--yet best bootmaker, apparently better than any bootmaker in nearby Manchester--who has known no other professional life than the shop. They enter into a marriage of convenience. Despite the differences in their social classes, Maggie believes she can show her father that she can find a husband while also forcing him to treat Willie better (and by association her) in paying him decent wages, otherwise she will use her wifely influence to convince Willie to take his and her valuable services elsewhere. If their hands are forced, Maggie believes their best weapon is wealthy, particular Mrs. Hepworth, who said that only Willie shall ever make her boots. Maggie has even taken into consideration what effect her actions will have on her sisters' nuptials, vowing to them that all will be all right in that regard. Although she truly has no idea how her father will react, she hasn't considered Willie, who might already have his own life outside the shop.

A widower with a weakness for the pub opposite, he forcefully tries to run the lives of his three unruly daughters.

Maggie and Will leave to start up in competition, and she then turns her mind to helping her sisters marry their chosen partners.", "In Salford it's the time of revolution; the revolution is not industrial, but feminine. This film shows how strong females come to the fore in shaping their own world at a time when it was frowned upon. Behind the boots and clogs are individuals who must also be determined and strong in a society that gives them little credence. Keeping the humor, it also shows without fantasy the life of the Salford folk and the social connections and customs that gave their life order until they were challenged and eventually changed."]},

Titanic's sinking from the standpoint of Second Officer Charles Herbert Lightoller, himself the most senior of the ill-fated ship's Deck Officers to survive the disaster (Lightoller later went on to distinguish himself as a line British Naval Officer during the First World War and served as a Senior Naval Staff Officer on convoys during World War II. Between wars, he owned and operated a successful family business producing pleasure craft). His own survival of the sinking, along with several others, is shown atop one of the liner's two \"collapsible\" lifeboats which were capsized in floating off the liner as it sank. The picture depicts then known facts (1958) as reported after the sinking--such as the woeful lack of adequate lifeboats, the ship's band playing true to the very end, White Star's co-owner Bruce Ismay's somewhat less-than-chivalrous departure from the sinking vessel, and the Titanic's designer's (Thomas Andrews) revelation that due to the severity of below-the-water-line damage and that the vaunted watertight compartments were not designed to nor sealed up to the weather deck, would only delay the inevitable as sea water spilled over the top of one to the next from the bows to the stern. It also addresses the mysterious ship seen from the Titanic's bridge stopped some 12-19 miles off and depicts it as being the S.S.

The Californian is seen stopped due to the ice warnings, the same alerts whose import were undervalued by Captain Edward J. Smith. She herself had shut-down wireless operations, nominally at 11:00pm as her sole operator retired for the evening, this before the iceberg was struck and the first distress calls were made by Titanic.

The film also shows the class distinction and its impact as to whom - of the \"women and children first\", got a seat in a boat; the fact that the first/earliest lifeboats launched were not at full capacity; and that the boats launched from the port and starboard side held to different criteria as to loading. The latter allows the viewer an inference as to the importance for crew and passenger alike as to lifeboat drills which were then (1912) neither required nor ever held aboard Titanic. One of several movies on the subject, it stands well the test-of-time for its \"just the facts\" approach in the telling and avoidance of conjecture or added melodrama.", "Reasonably accurate account of the sinking of the R.M.S.

The ship carried only enough lifeboats for half of the passengers and crew but even at that little more than a third of them survived. The film also recounts the activity on the R.M.S. Carpathia, which sailed to the survivors' rescue and the S.S. California which failed to recognize their distress signal. With lifeboat places for only 1200 people, it is not only women and children first, but also First Class before Steerage.", "It is 1912, and the White Star Line's new ship - the 'unsinkable' R.M.S. Titanic - is making its maiden voyage across the Atlantic from Southhampton to New York City. Unfortunately, the night of April 14, 1912 proves to be a night in which man's arrogant overconfidence in his technological creations was shaken to its core, as the legendary ship collides with an iceberg in the North Atlantic. The much-touted watertight compartment system that supposedly rendered it 'unsinkable' was never designed to cope with such extensive damage, and the Titanic is doomed. Focusing on the accounts of most of the real people who sailed on the ship, it centers largely on the experiences of the ship's second officer, Charles Herbert Lightoller. With these accounts come frightening revelations about the ship - not only are there way too few lifeboats, but people are loaded into them according to their class - First Class before Steerage. Based on the late Walter Lord's book of the same title."]},

With Paul's grandfather available for additional comical relief, the group performs a dozen or so songs.", "John, Paul, George, and Ringo--collectively known as ", "--leave their Liverpool home-base to head to London where they are to perform on television. There they have a few official engagements beforehand, such as rehearsals at the studio and a press conference; otherwise they are stuck at the hotel. In addition, they want some free time out to just be lads, which could be difficult if not impossible, as throngs of adoring, screaming young female fans follow them wherever they are known to be. They also encounter a few people who would rather not associate with them because of different sensibilities; a few people who, when seeing only one at a time, wonder if they are who they look to be; and a few people who mistake them for other people. Sheltered Ringo, in particular, takes advantage of what little freedom they have, which could cause problems for them all in the end. Helping them navigate through all these issues but also ensuring that they do their work as celebrities are two of their managers, Norm and Shake, who are accompanying them on this trip and having a disagreement about height. Also along for the ride is Paul's paternal grandfather, John McCartneyl Paul's mum believes that he needs an outing to nurse a broken heart. Despite his outwardly-innocent appearance, McCartney Sr. ends up being a mischievous soul, and all four boys must help help get out of each one. But at least McCartney Sr. is clean, \"very clean\".", "The cult classic which captures John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr in their electrifying element is a wildly irreverent journey through this pastiche of a day in the life of The Beatles during 1964. The band must use all their guile and wit to avoid the pursuing fans and press to reach their scheduled television performance, in spite of Paul's troublemaking grandfather and Ringo's arrest.", "The plot is a study of a day in the life of the Fab Four beginning with them running from their adoring fans to catch a train. Every plot point circles around the band getting to a television show in order to perform a live concert, and within this stream of action is a series of slapstick, zany, and otherwise wacky bits of funniness. One obstacle in the works is Paul McCartney's babysitting of his grandfather (Wilfrid Brambell), a first class mixer always getting into mischief. It becomes one of the running jokes in the film that Brambell is a \"clean old man,\" at least physically (this contrasts with Brambell's most famous role as Albert Steptoe in Steptoe and Son where he was a \"dirty old man\" both physically and psychologically). Ringo Starr gets a sense of liberation and goes off on his own to find happiness only to land in jail for loitering. John Lennon fires playful barbs at TV director (Victor Spinetti), whose biggest worry is that if for some reason the Beatles stand him up his next job will be doing \"news in Welsh.\" One great story line is with George Harrison, in which he is mistaken for an actor auditioning for some trendy TV show for some trend setter hostess. The earnest demeanor of the casting head and his associates is undercut by George's declaration that she is a well-known drag. Norman Rossington and John Junkin as The Beatles' managers are stalwart English character actors who fill out the cast and support the general lunacy of the film with a more traditional presence, but still sustain an on-going battle about one being taller than the other. Anna Quayle has a great bit with John Lennon about his being someone he's not. The whole thing ends with an ear-shattering concert and the band yet again running from the adoring fans."]},

Through Motorcycle Boy's example, he finally learns to break free from others' expectations, and his own inner demons.", "Set in Tulsa, Oklahoma, the film begins in a diner called Benny's Billiards, where local tough guy Rusty James is told by Midget that rival group leader Biff Wilcox wants to meet him that night in an abandoned garage lot for a fight.

The two battle, with the fight ending when Rusty James disarms Biff and beats him almost unconscious.

Later, Steve and Rusty James wander drunkenly home, and are attacked by thugs, but both are saved by the Motorcycle Boy. As he nurses Rusty James again, the Motorcycle Boy tells him that the gang life and the rumbles he yearns for and idolizes are not what he believes them to be. Steve calls the Motorcycle Boy crazy, a claim which the Motorcycle Boy does not deny, further prompting Rusty James to believe his brother is insane, just like his runaway mother supposedly was.", "Rusty James meets up with the Motorcycle Boy the next day in a pet store, where the latter is strangely fascinated with the Siamese fighting fish, which he refers to as \"rumble fish.\" Officer Patterson suspects they will try to rob the store.

The brothers go for a motorcycle ride through the city and arrive at the Pet Store where the Motorcycle Boy breaks in and starts to set the animals loose. Rusty James makes a last-gasp effort to convince his brother to reunite with him, but the Motorcycle Boy refuses, explaining that the differences between them are too great for them to ever have the life Rusty James speaks of.

And that's just the beginning--her life seems to be falling apart when she faces rejection from the older guy in her brother's band that she has a crush on, her parents want to tear down her 'Special People's Club' clubhouse, and her sister is abducted....", "Seventh grade Benjamin Franklin Junior High School student Dawn Wiener is a social outcast who wants to be liked. At school, she is often bullied and called Wiener Dog. The other social outcasts don't want to associate with her. Her teachers don't even seem to like her. And at home, her parents, especially her mother, favor Dawn's younger sister, the ballerina princess-like Missy, or Dawn's older brother, the nerdish Mark, who at least has a focus on the goal of getting into a good college. Because of this lack of attention at home, Dawn will often use the bullying tactics used on her by others on Missy, which gets her into even more trouble with her parents. Dawn's want for social acceptance leads her quietly fostering the attention of one of her primary school bullies, Brandon McCarthy, a boy from the proverbial wrong side of the tracks who always threatens to rape her. But Dawn's focus on Brandon lessens when Mark enlists the services of older popular student Steve Rodgers for his mediocre band (in exchange for help at school). Because he doesn't shun her, Dawn works toward the goal of getting Steve to be her boyfriend.", "Dawn Wiener (Heather Matarazzo) is a shy, unattractive, unpopular 12-year-old 7th grader in a middle-class suburban community in New Jersey. Her older brother Mark (Matthew Faber) is a nerdy 11th grade high school student who plays the clarinet in a garage band and shuns girls in order to prepare for college. Dawn's younger sister Missy (Daria Kalinina) is a seven-year-old spoiled, manipulative little girl who pesters Dawn and dances happily in a tutu. Their mother (Angela Pietropinto) is a shrewish, overbearing woman who dotes on Missy and always sides with her in disputes with Dawn. Their father is a meek, selfish businessman who always sides with Dawn's mother. Dawn's only friend is an effeminate fifth-grade boy named Ralphy (Dimitri DeFresco), with whom she shares a dilapidated clubhouse in her backyard.", "Dawn's life in junior high is even more miserable: all of classmates call her names and cover her locker with derisive graffiti, the cheerleaders call her a lesbian, an abrasive teacher unfairly keeps her after school one day for no reason, another girl forces her to use the toilet while the girl watches, and she is threatened with rape by a bully named Brandon McCarthy (Brendon Sexton), who has almost as much trouble socializing as she does. Her attempts to take out her frustrations only get her into trouble.", "At home, her mother punishes her for calling Missy a lesbian and refusing to be nice to her (considering that Missy is never friendly towards Dawn). The next day at school, Dawn accidentally hits a teacher in the eye with a spitball and she gets suspended for three days. Dawn's stupid and ignorant parents continue to be unsure of what is causing her rude behavior and Dawn refuses to talk to them about her hellish life at school, aware that they will not understand.", "Brandon's first attempt to rape Dawn after school fails when he does not seem to force himself upon her, but he orders her to meet him again the next day after school. After she presents herself to him and he takes her to an abandoned field, he starts an earnest conversation and only kisses her, even though she is obviously willing. Brandon is clearly not the bad seed that he puts himself out to be, but just like Dawn, he is a socially awkward kid who hides his own unhappiness behind anger and aggression.", "Meanwhile, Mark's band is joined by Steve Rodgers (Eric Mabius), a cool, handsome 19-year-old guy who intends to become a rock star. Dawn immediately falls in love with him, and she decides to pursue him romantically after he spends some time with her, even though one of Steve's former girlfriends explains to Dawn that she has no chance to become his current girlfriend.", "As the film continues, Dawn and Brandon treat each other ambivalently. He bonds with her in her clubhouse only after another girl rejects him, and Dawn pursues him only after Steve rejects her. Toward the end of the film, Brandon is expelled from school for suspected drug dealing and, after kissing Dawn, runs away to avoid being sent to military school. Dawn comes over to Brandon's house the day he runs away to visit and sees that his home life is even worse then hers; He has an abusive and alcoholic widowed father, and a mentally retarded older brother who requires constant supervision. After angrily rejecting Ralphy as a boyfriend, Dawn is left with no friends at all.", "The next occasion of Dawn's embarrassment is a lawn party to celebrate her parents' 18th wedding anniversary. When Dawn refuses to tear down her clubhouse to make room for the party, her mother has Mark and Missy destroy it and gives them her share of a chocolate cake. At the party, Missy humiliates Dawn when she pushes her into a kiddie pool for no reason in front of the assembled guests who laugh at it. That evening, the family watches a videotape of the party, with all of them (except Dawn) laughing when Dawn falls into the water, which further alienates her as her immature parents continue to remain oblivious to Dawn's alienation. Later that night, Dawn smashes the videotape to pieces with a hammer and briefly brandishes her hammer over Missy's bed as she sleeps to bludgeon her to death. But Dawn cannot bring herself to commit murder and instead walks away and goes to bed.", "Dawn's ultimate personal disaster occurs a few weeks later when her father's car breaks down while he is driving home from work and her mother has to pick him up. Dawn is to tell Missy to find a ride home from ballet class while their mother is away. However, Missy argues with Dawn, who retaliates by not telling her, with the result that Missy is kidnapped by a stranger while she is walking home alone. When Missy's tutu is found in Times Square, Dawn goes to New York City hoping to find Missy and become a hero to make her difficult parents notice and respect her. After a full day and night of searching fruitlessly for Missy, Dawn phones home to check up on what is going on and Mark tells her that Missy has been found by the police after she was abducted by a neighbor who lives just down their street, but Missy was not sexually abused or hurt, but only spoiled with treats by her abductor. Dawn returns home dejected and she is soon appalled when she sees that both of her parents were too preoccupied with Missy's traumatic kidnapping ordeal to even notice Dawn's own absence. But at least to Dawn's credit, her parents never figure out that she was indirectly responsible for Missy kidnapping by withholding information from her that led to Missy being abducted in the first place.", "After this, Dawn's classmates make fun of her as she gives a speech in the assembly hall to thank them for their \"emotional support\". It is only after the principal orders the unruly students to be quiet, Dawn gives herself enough mental strength to finish her speech and then makes a quick exit from the auditorium.", "A few more weeks later, school is let out for the summer. Having passed 7th grade, Dawn is relieved that her painful ordeal at school is over... at least for the next three months. Afterwards, Dawn's mental state takes a further blow when Mark offers her no hope of a better life until high school... which according to him is will not be much better.", "As the movie comes to an end, Dawn finds herself literally back where she started... only worse. She is still unpopular and unattractive, she still has no friends, and on top of that, her selfish and immature parents have gone from mistreating and neglecting her to ignoring her completely. Rather then counting down the long summer days to go back to school for 8th grade (and thus endure another hellish year of bullying and abuse), Dawn decides to get away from her home life by signing herself up for a month-long school summer trip to Florida's Walt Disney World. Her self-involved parents are still too pre-occupied with their own lives to approve of Dawn's permission to leave for the summer, and do not even notice her packing up to leave, much less say \"goodbye\" to her.", "The final scene shows Dawn sitting among her other classmates on the school bus as she obediently joins the students singing the school anthem during the field trip to Florida. While the other girls continue singing the school anthem, Dawn, unnoticed by everyone else, slowly stops singing as she sorrowfully looks out the bus window to ponder her uncertain future."]},

In response, Gort, a large humanoid robot, emerges from the ship and, without harming the soldiers, melts all weapons present with a disintegration ray emanating from its head. Klaatu orders it to stop and explains that the ruined object was an intergalactic viewing device - a gift for the President.", "Klaatu is taken to an army hospital where he is found to be physically human-like, but he stuns the doctors with the quickness of his healing. Meanwhile, the military attempts to enter Klaatu's ship but finds it impregnable. Gort stands by, mute, stationary and impregnable as well.", "Klaatu reveals to the President's secretary, Harley (Frank Conroy), that he bears a message so momentous and urgent that it can and must be revealed to all the world's leaders simultaneously. Harley, however, tells him that it would be impossible to get the squabbling world leaders to agree to meet. Pondering this, Klaatu wants to get to know the ordinary people. Harley forbids it and leaves Klaatu locked up under guard.", "Klaatu escapes and lodges at a boarding house, assuming the alias \"Mr. Carpenter.\" Among the residents are World War II widow Helen Benson (Patricia Neal) and her son Bobby (Billy Gray). At breakfast the next morning, during alarming radio reports, Klaatu takes in the unknowing fellow boarders' suspicions and speculations about the purpose of the alien's visit.", "While Helen and her boyfriend Tom Stephens (Hugh Marlowe) go on a day trip, Klaatu babysits Bobby. The boy takes Klaatu on a tour of the city, including a visit to his father's grave in Arlington National Cemetery, where Klaatu is dismayed to learn that most of those buried there were killed in wars. The two visit the heavily guarded spaceship and the Lincoln Memorial. Klaatu, impressed by the Gettysburg Address inscription, queries Bobby for the greatest person living in the world. Bobby suggests a leading American scientist, Professor Jacob Barnhardt (Sam Jaffe), who lives in Washington, D.C. Bobby takes Klaatu to Prof. Barnhardt's home, but the professor is absent. Klaatu enters and adds a key mathematical equation to an advanced problem on the professor's blackboard, then leaves his contact information with the suspicious housekeeper.", "Later, government agents escort Klaatu to see Barnhardt. Klaatu introduces himself and privately warns the professor that the people of other planets have become concerned for their own safety after human beings developed atomic power. Klaatu declares that if his message goes unheeded, \"Planet Earth will be eliminated.\" Barnhardt agrees to arrange a meeting of scientists at Klaatu's ship and suggests that Klaatu give a demonstration of his power. Klaatu returns to his spaceship the next evening to implement the idea, unaware that Bobby has followed him.", "Bobby tells the unbelieving Helen and Tom what has transpired, but not until Tom finds a diamond on the floor of Klaatu's room do they begin to accept his story. When Tom takes the diamond for appraisal, the jeweler informs him it is unlike any other gem on Earth.", "Hearing of Bobby's story, Klaatu finds Helen at her workplace. She nervously leads him to an unoccupied elevator which mysteriously stops at noon, trapping them together. Klaatu admits he is responsible, tells Helen his true identity, and asks for her help.

The only one not distressed is Professor Barnhardt, who sits in his office, admiring Klaatu's manner of demonstrated power.", "After the thirty-minute blackout ends, the manhunt for Klaatu intensifies and Tom informs authorities of his suspicions. Helen is very upset by Tom's betrayal of Klaatu and breaks off their relationship. Helen and Klaatu take a taxi to Barnhardt's home; en route, Klaatu instructs Helen that, should anything happen to him, she must tell Gort \"Klaatu barada nikto\".

Finally hearing it before he kills her too, Gort gently deposits her in the spaceship, then goes to fetch Klaatu's corpse. Gort then revives Klaatu while the amazed Helen looks on. Klaatu explains that his revival is only temporary: even with their advanced technology, they cannot truly overcome death.", "Klaatu steps out of the spaceship and addresses the assembled scientists, explaining that humanity's penchant for violence while taking its first steps into space after discovering atomic power have sparked concern among other inhabitants of the universe who have created and empowered a race of robot enforcers (including Gort) to deter such aggression. He warns that if the people of Earth threaten to extend their violence into space, the robots will destroy Earth, adding, \"The decision rests with you.\" He enters the spaceship and departs."]},

That night, the immigrants use the remnants of their horse-drawn carts and logs from the surrounding forest to build mobile barricades whilst the Association men only hear their singing.", "In the morning, Jim rides around the field of battle and issues commands to the immigrants, who push their wheeled barricades towards the Association encampment. The bullets from the Association shooters are mostly unable to penetrate the logs. Recognizing Jim's plan of attack, Major Wolcott says \"Goddamn Romans!\" Pushing closer and surrounding the encampment, the immigrants use sticks of dynamite to penetrate the Association's defense. Some immigrants are caught by gunfire and one man's legs are crushed by the wheels of the barricade. He is shot by his wife who later shoots herself. Canton escapes to gather more forces. It looks like the immigrants are about to win. Wolcott is killed. Suddenly, Canton arrives with the cavalry and the American flag bravely flying (and clearly focused on) to arrest the remaining Association members.

When Dr. John Markway gets a chance to stay there for a few weeks, he sees an opportunity to study what is reportedly a genuine haunted house.

Theo is there because of her ESP skills while Nell had a previous experience with a poltergeist and Luke represents the family that still owns Hill House. Soon after their arrival, the temporary occupants begin to face terrifying ordeals. Nell, who has lived a sheltered and repressed life having spent all of her time caring for her recently deceased mother, is clearly the focus of the emanations and the haunting.

When she is an old and invalid woman, she hires a paid companion from the village, but the woman neglects her and she dies. The companion inherits Hill House but the mansion drives her crazy and she commits suicide. In the present days (1963), Dr. John Markway rents the mansion from the inheritor Mrs. Sannerson to study the supernatural and prove the existence of ghosts.

During the nights, the quartet witness supernatural manifestation in the house and the sanity of Nell is affected by her ghosts.", "Anthropologist Dr. John Markway is interested in the study of the supernatural, much to the chagrin of his wife, Grace Markway. He is able to convince Mrs. Sannerson, the current owner of isolated Hill House, to let him bring a research team into the house to search for supernatural phenomena. In its ninety year history, Hill House, located in remote New England, has been the location of many a violent and mysterious death of its inhabitants, Mrs. Sannerson being a distant relative of Abigail Crain's companion who inherited Hill House upon old Abigail Crain's death. The house has been handed down to the current owner, Mrs. Sannerson. She doesn't live at the house believing it to be haunted, but has one stipulation: that her Midwestern nephew Luke Sannerson, the spoiled and immature supposed heir of the house, be part of that research team. The other two members of the team, who Dr. Markway has not yet met but hired solely based one issue he knows about each, are surname-less Theodora - \"Theo\" - and Eleanor Lance - \"Nell\" - the former a somewhat glib psychic, the latter who grew up with some supernatural phenomena which she would rather forget. Eleanor is a meek and nervous woman who has felt trapped in most of her adult life, having to take care of her invalid mother until her passing two months ago about which she feels some guilt in its occurrence. Currently living with her married sister, Eleanor sees this research as a vacation, realistically an escape from her current sad life. As the research progresses, the four members truly begin to believe that there is something supernatural about their environment. But Eleanor begins to feel connected to the house, and what is happening in it... or is she just justifying it as a better replacement for her current life?", "The film opens with narration over a silhouette of Hill House at night. The narrator, Dr. John Markway (Richard Johnson) tells us, \"An evil old house, the kind some people call haunted is like an undiscovered country waiting to be explored. Hill House had stood for 90 years and might stand for 90 more. Silence lay steadily against the wood and stone of Hill House. Whatever walked there walked alone.\" Title and credits follow, then narration continues, \"Scandal, murder, insanity, suicide: The history of Hill House was ideal. It had everything I wanted...\" The house was built in New England by a man named Hugh Crain for his wife and young daughter. A horse and carriage accident took the life of the first Mrs. Crain (an uncredited Pamela Buckley) before she even saw the house. Hugh Crain (an uncredited Howard Lang) and young daughter, Abigail (an uncredited Janet Mansell) said a few words over the body, but Hugh was left an embittered man. Crain married again, and the second Mrs. Crain (an uncredited Freda Knorr) also died, falling down the main staircase. Hugh Crain left Abigail with a nurse (an uncredited Susan Richards) and went to England where he died in a drowning accident. Abigail kept the same nursery room her entire life. By the time she was eighty (an uncredited Amy Dalby) she was a bedridden invalid. Her nurse-companion (an uncredited Rosemary Dorken) was a local girl and, it is with this young companion the evil reputation of Hill House really begins. The old lady died while calling for help. The companion was trysting on the verandah with a farm hand. The companion inherited Hill House and occupied it for many years, but eventually hanged herself. The house then passed to a distant relative, named Mrs. Sannerson (Fay Compton).", "Markway visits Mrs. Sannerson where he convinces her to let him use the house for psychic research. He explains, \"I shall occupy the house with a group of carefully selected assistants...I must have specially qualified help to take notes and document any evidence of the supernatural I may find.\" Eldridge Harper (Ronald Adam), Mrs. Sannerson's lawyer, voices his concern about publicity seekers and the propriety of having women in the house. Harper suggests to Mrs. Sannerson that her nephew, Luke, joins the doctor at Hill House, as he expects to inherit the property. Mrs. Sannerson asks point blank, \"Exactly what do you and your assistants expect to find at Hill House?\" Markway replies, \"Maybe only a few loose floorboards, and maybe, I only say maybe, the key to another world.\"", "Dr. Markway, taking a leave of absence from his university professorship, finalizes his list of assistants. Only two end up accepting, Eleanor Lance and Theodora (no last name).", "Eleanor Lance (Julie Harris) is living with her sister. She is nearly broke and weary after looking after her invalid mother non-stop for eleven years. Mother is now dead, and she fights with her sister over just about everything. She begs to use the car, which is after all, half hers. Her brother-in-law, Bud Fredericks (an uncredited Paul Maxwell) tries to act as mediator between Eleanor and his wife, Carrie (Diane Clare). He is sympathetic to Eleanor's plight, but their daughter, Dora (an uncredited Verina Greenlaw) takes her cues from her mother, and taunts her Aunt Eleanor. On the vacation plan, Bud sides with Eleanor, \"I think you should have a vacation, Nell.\" Carrie objects, but Eleanor is not to be deterred and she shows her family how she reacts when pushed to her breaking point. She is normally quiet and meek, but when pushed is loud and assertive.", "Nell decides to take the car and confronts the garage attendant (an uncredited Claude Jones) for the keys. She departs Boston along U.S. 50 and Route 238 to Hill House. We hear Nell thinking and she reveals she will never return to live with her sister. In fact, most of what we learn of Eleanor is hearing her thoughts.", "Eleanor arrives at Hill House. The property is surrounded by a stone wall and the entrance by a tall, iron spiked, gate. She honks the car horn, and Mr. Dudley (Valentine Dyall), the cranky caretaker, finally deigns to respond. \"What do you want?\" he asks. Eleanor explains that she is expected. After an impertinent exchange with Eleanor, Dudley finally opens the gate and allows her to enter the property. Eleanor is the first to arrive and drives up to the house. Along the way she stops to look at it. It is a huge, stone mansion with lots of detail on the façade and steep, pitched roofs. Her first reaction is that the house is vile and it is staring at her. She carries her suitcase to the front door and is greeted by Mrs. Dudley (Rosalie Crutchley). Mrs. Dudley reluctantly allows Eleanor to come inside, but does not utter a word to her.", "The inside of the house is dark and over-decorated, and Eleanor is escorted to her room. Mrs. Dudley explains the house rules about meals, and that she won't stay in the house after dark. Eleanor checks out the bathroom and hears the next guest arrive. Theodora (Claire Bloom) introduces herself. Eleanor explains they share a bathroom. Mrs. Dudley repeats her meal and departure rules by rote, but Theo and Nell ignore her. Theodora is a bit strange to Eleanor (Theo clearly flirts with Eleanor throughout the film) Theodora's sexual orientation is only hinted at, and we later learn she has the gift of ESP. Theo and Nell explore the house, but they get lost. Both women feel a chill, and Nell observes, \"The house, it's alive.\" Theo seems to feel that the house wants Nell.", "Dr. Markway appears and explains he left the door opened, but it closed itself. Markway gives the women a tour of part of the house, starting with the main purple parlor, which they will use as an operations center. He explains that all the doors were set slightly off-center, so they close themselves. Despite studying plans to the house, even Markway gets lost on his way to the dining room. They hear a noise, but it turns out to be Luke Sannerson (Russ Tamblyn) mixing a pitcher of martinis as he enters the dining room. Luke serves each person a martini. They sit down for dinner and discuss their duties and responsibilities. Markway explains that Theo was accepted because of her remarkable power of ESP and Eleanor had a poltergeist experience as a child, \"showers of stone fell on your house for three days when you were 10 years old.\" Luke is a non-believer. His interest is to financially exploit Hill House, after he inherits it, of course.", "That evening, in the parlor, Markway works on his notes while Eleanor sits quietly on the couch. Theo and Luke play gin rummy at the game table. Theo's ability to see cards allows her to win five games in a row, much to Luke annoyance. She demands he pay her the $12 he owes, but he refuses because she cheated. The four decide to turn in for the night and continue the tour the next morning. Markway gives them papers and asks that they complete them with their observations each night.", "Sometime during the night, Eleanor wakes, and still in a near dream state, thinks she hears her mother knocking on the wall. Theo hears it from the next room also and calls to Nell. The two women are frightened and both hear the pounding noise. It comes and goes, but louder each time. They finally hear a woman shrieking and laughing that fades away. When Nell opens the door she sees Luke and Markway in the hall outside. The men explain they were chasing a dog and followed it outside, but they did not hear the loud noises the women heard. Markway concludes that something is trying to separate the men and women.", "The next morning, Markway and Nell join for breakfast. Nell is starting to develop romantic feelings for John Markway, unaware that he is married. She tells him that she spent eleven years taking care of her invalid mother. Nell also voices her fear that she will be turned out of Hill House with no where to go. Markway tells Nell how he came to do psychic research, and that his family disapproves. Theo joins the pair and warns the doctor, \"If anyone gets hurt, it's going to be your fault, Markway.\" Markway explains that no one has ever been physically hurt by a ghost. Luke enters and directs his companions to something he saw in the hall. Someone or something has handwritten a message in chalk on the wall. It says, \"Help Eleanor Come Home.\" Eleanor reacts strongly. She first accuses Theo of playing a cruel joke. The two women bicker and Markway postpones the tour and tells Theo to take Eleanor to her room.", "The tour starts with the greenhouse. A large stone sculpture sits in the center of the room. It is supposed to be St. Francis curing the lepers, but Luke thinks its a family portrait of Hugh Crain and his wives and daughter. Suddenly, the door slams open and a gust of wind moves the plants. They approach the library, but Nell refuses to enter. The smell reminds her of her mother's sick room. Prominent in the room is a very tall, wrought iron, spiral staircase. Markway points out that the balcony high above is where the companion to Abigail Crain hanged herself. Luke climbs up a few feet on the staircase, but jumps back to the ground when it starts to sway and shake.", "Eleanor ventures out to the verandah and nearly falls over the balcony as she looks up to the tower above the library. Markway threatens to send her home, but Nell begs to stay. Markway suggests Theo and Nell share a bedroom... \"like sisters\". That evening, the two women discuss their lives and plans for the future. Nell makes up a story about having an apartment of her own. Just when Theo is about to make a move onto Nell, Markway calls them and Luke into the hallway outside the Nursery. He has discovered a cold spot. He invites all to experience the phenomenon. He gleefully explains, \"A cold spot, a genuine cold spot. I guarantee it won't register on any thermometer.\" Luke dismisses it as just a draft, but Markway says it is the heart of Hill House: The Nursery.", "In the middle of the night, Nell awakens. She hears a little girl laughing. She asks Theo to hold her hand, as their two beds are almost touching. The laughter continues and Nell complains, \"Theo, you're breaking my hand.\" The laughs turn to wimpering and Nell complains that something is hurting a child and she won't allow that to happen. She yells, \"Stop It!\" Theo turns on the light and we see Nell is on a day bed about twenty feet from the bed Theo occupies. Nell stares at her hand and asks, \"Whose hand was I holding?\"", "The next morning, Markway is in the music room and checks his watch and makes a note about the harp playing itself. Nell enters the room and asks about how it could play itself. Markway explains that it may be preternatural: Something we don't have any natural explanation for right now, but probably will have some day. Nell voices her fear that it is all in her imagination and concludes she may be going insane. She is haunted by the circumstances of her mother's death and that she may somehow be responsible. They both hear the harp play a note and Markway again checks his watch and makes a note in his paperwork.", "That evening, Luke finds a disturbing book that Hugh Crain made for his daughter, Abigail. Nell and Theo bicker and Markway notes that everyone's nerves are on edge. Theo continues to flirt as well as needle Nell, this time about a budding romance she fantasizes about with John Markway. Nell runs away and Theo catches up to her, and tells Nell that is he is making a fool of herself in thinking that Dr. Markway will ever get involved with her. Nell accuses Theo of being an \"unnatural thing\" as well as a \"nature's mistake.\"", "At that moment, a car horn honks and a taxi pulls up in front of the house. Grace Markway (Lois Maxwell), John's wife, arrives. She informs her husband, \"A reporter's been telephoning all day. He's on your track. He's heard about you renting this place.\" Grace begs her husband to abandon the house and his research. When John refuses, Grace pays the driver, grabs her suitcase and announces she is staying at Hill House, \"to join the ghost hunt.\" When Eleanor casually mentions the nursery as a place to stay, Grace quickly accepts the challenge, \"Thank you, my dear. The nursery it is.\" Markway and Nell try to dissuade her, but Grace responds, \"You insult my intelligence. You don't think I'd believe anything you ghost hunters might tell me.\" Luke notices the door to the nursery is open for the first time. Grace decides to spend the night in the room, despite everyone's warning not to. Markway insists he and the three researchers spend the night downstairs in the parlor.", "Later that night, Nell and Theo sleep together on the sofa by the fireplace as Markway sleeps in a chair. Luke finishes his tour upstairs and enters the parlor. He heads for a bottle on the mantle. Suddenly, the parlor door slams shut by itself and the others wake with a start. They hear a deep rhythmic banging outside the door. Markway is concerned about his wife upstairs. Next a very loud banging comes from just outside the door. The unseen phantom presses against the parlor door as it bows inward and out like breathing, creaking and crunching against the hinges. The sound moves to overhead towards the nursery. Markway is desperate to check on his wife.", "Unseen, Nell runs from the parlor, through the music room, and upstairs directly to the nursery room. The doors are open, but Grace Markway is nowhere to be seen. Her bed shows signs of being used. Markway and the others arrive and start the search. Nell wanders away. She finds herself in the greenhouse. Descending into her own little world, Nell dances out onto the verandah. When she hears the others calling to her, Nell runs into the Library. She is drawn to the spiral staircase and the balcony at the top. Before she reaches the top, the rickety staircase begins its swaying, the lateral support bolts pulling away from the wall. Markway calls to her, begging her to carefully walk back down. She ignores him and stands on the balcony. Markway carefully climbs the stairs and joins Nell on the iron balcony platform. Before they walk back down, Nell sees Grace Markway peer at her through a trap door in the ceiling.", "A little later, Markway is furious and now insists Eleanor leave the house for her own safety. Luke brings her car around and Theo packs her bag. Nell tries to talk them out of her dismissal, but the three insist she leave. They escort Eleanor out to her car. Luke gets back out of Nell's car to retrieve the gate key from Markway. She drives off without Luke. Before she reaches the gate she is distracted by the white-robed figure of Grace Markway and crashes into a tree.", "The three find Eleanor dead in the half overturned car. She crashed into the same tree that killed the first Mrs. Crain. Grace wanders over to the accident scene. She explains to her husband, \"I didn't want any of this to happen. You must believe me, John.\" She explains that she woke and was frightened. She got lost looking for her husband and ended up in the attic. While Theo blames Grace for Eleanor's accident, Luke takes a different view. \"Eleanor did it to herself. It looked to me, anyway, like she deliberately aimed the car at this tree.\" Markway blames the house. Luke stares at the house and remarks, \"It ought to be burned down and the ground sowed with salt.\"", "We close with an evening shot of Hill House with Eleanor, now a ghost, narrating from beyond the grave about Hill House and that \"we who walk here... walk alone.\" The end title comes up as well as the final title card 'The Haunting' followed by eerie piano music."]},

Hopelessly in love with his widowed and gloomily beautiful landlady, Mrs Margaret Hammond, Frank finds himself caught in the middle of his ferocious ambition and his unrequited love for the unattainable object of his desire, completely unable to break free from the agony of his bottled-up emotions.

While relevant still photos are shown, we learn that in 1931, director Sergei M. Eisenstein, producer Grigori Aleksandrov and cinematographer Eduard Tisse came to USA for talks with Paramount, but no agreement resulted. This team was responsible for the successful prior films Battleship Potemkin and October. Some funding was arranged by writer Upton Sinclair, and the team went to Mexico to make a movie about its history and culture. With advice from Mexican intellectuals and artists, they traveled around Mexico and shot film. For a variety of financial and political reasons, Upton Sinclair deposited the film in Museum of Modern Art in New York for safekeeping. Eisenstein was never allowed to edit this movie. In 1979, the Soviet Union government retrieved the shot film and Grigori Aleksandrov prepared this version, using notes, sketches, and narration written by Eisenstein in addition to Aleksandrov's own recollections.", "The second sequence shows traces in 1931 Mexico of pre Columbian Mexico, first a montage of ancient sculptures and monuments, showing live persons whose appearance resembles the faces seen in the sculptures. Animals that appear in the sculptures, particularly birds and monkeys, are shown in their habitats. A burial ceremony appears to be quite ancient in concept. Next, there are shots of everyday life in a remote community where it seems that nothing has changed in several hundred years. The narration comments that the culture is matriarchal, with the women doing most of the daily work and selecting shelter and mates, and we see daily work and dwellings of pre-Columbian design.", "As we see relevant images, the narrator says that girls, starting in childhood, age about eight, work in order to save money to accumulate enough gold coins for a full necklace. When they have the full necklace, they are of marriageable age and select their own mate. Their wedding feast involves the entire village: the older matriarchs plan it, then there are costumes, food galore, dances and music. This sequence focuses on one such young woman, Concepción, her necklace, and wedding. The smiling couple is shown on a hammock, with a toddler, supposedly some years later.", "The third sequence, labeled FIESTA, shows details of an elaborate yearly festival in honor of the Virgin of Guadalupe, Mexico's patron saint. The narration says that these customs are a hybrid of pre Columbian elements with Spanish Catholic church teachings and traditions. Pilgrimages consist of walking on knees, sometimes real, sometimes simulated, up to the tops of hills where there are churches or shrines, many of them built precisely where pre Columbian pagan temples existed. Other male pilgrims tie their arms to Saguaro cactus beams that are carried horizontally on their shoulders as they represent Jesus on his way to his crucifixion. After the pilgrimages, there are celebrations with dances and prayers and parades. Catholic Church officials are the principal dignitaries. In the parades one can see many costumes and masks that clearly represent the Spanish Conquistadores, Cortez and his companions.", "The fourth sequence shows how deeply Mexicans have adopted the purely Spanish import of bullfighting as part of their own tradition. One bullfighting day in the life of a top level bullfighter is shown, beginning with his complex dressing up in costume, going to visit his mother to get her blessing, going to church to pray to the Virgin of the Macarena, patroness of bullfighters, the events and crowds at the bullring, the parade, the honoring of the Queen of the Corrida, the entrance of the bull and first sequence of passes, the picadores, the slaying of the bull, and the hats being thrown into the ring with money gifts inside the crown.

A complicated shootout ensues, the four laborers mainly on one hand, the plantation owner and his henchmen on the other. An interesting detail is that the daughter of the owner participates.", "At the end of the shootout, one of the rebels has been shot dead, the other three are captured, bound, buried in the ground with only shoulders and head above ground.

As the party of trappers struggle to navigate back to the distant Fort Kiowa, a swift and devastating attack by a formidable grizzly bear leaves a brutally mauled Glass on the brink of death, double-crossed and abandoned by his men. Now, only Hugh's rabid desire to live can help him survive the piercing cold and the grave dangers in one of the world's most inhospitable environments, giving him the strength to drag his unrecognisable carcass and exact his revenge.

The surviving trappers escape onto a boat. Guided by Glass, who is questioned by some trappers, they next reach on foot Fort Kiowa, as traveling downriver would make them vulnerable. After docking, they stashes the pelts. While scouting game, Glass is mauled by a grizzly bear and left presumably dying. Trapper John Fitzgerald fears another Arikara attack, argues they must mercy-kill Glass and keep moving. Henry offers money for two men to stay with Glass and bury him after he dies: the only volunteers are Hawk and the young Jim Bridger, yet Fitzgerald agrees to stay for money, to recoup his losses from the abandoned pelts. After the others leave, Fitzgerald attempts to smother Glass but is discovered by Hawk, whom he soon after fatally steps while Bridger is gathering water, stabs Hawk to death .

He performs crude cauterization of his wounds, eludes the pursuing Arikara by jumping into rapids and teams up with Pawnee refugee Hikuc, sharing bison meat. As a storm approaches, Hikuc constructs a makeshift sweat lodge for a feverish Glass to shelter in. After a hallucinogenic experience in it, Glass emerges as his wounds are healing but Hikuc has been hanged by French hunters. He infiltrates their camp and frees raped Powaqa, kills several hunters and recovers Hikuc's horse. The next morning, Glass is ambushed by the Arikara and driven over a cliff on his horse.

They attempt to carry him up a hill, only for him to slide and bring the other men down. Fitzgerald suggests they need to just kill Glass and put him out of his misery. Henry covers Glass' eyes and almost shoots him in the head, but he cannot bring himself to do it. Henry offers payment of $75 to anyone who will stay behind with Glass. Hawk and Jim Bridger (Will Poulter) volunteer, though Fitzgerald points out that they and Glass will be likely to die. Henry raises the payment offer to $100 so that even Fitzgerald decides to stay with them until Glass expires.", "Glass is still in great pain and continues to have visions of his wife and the day his home was burnt down.", "Fitzgerald gets a moment alone with Glass and tries to convince him to let him put him out of his misery so that no one else is slowed down or left waiting to die, including Hawk. As Glass is unable to talk, Fitzgerald suggests Glass should blink if he agrees, knowing that Glass would eventually have to blink, with or without intention to agree to Fitzgerald's offer. Glass holds his eyes open for a long time before closing them, instead of blinking. Fitzgerald intentionally interprets this as blinking and starts to smother Glass. Hawk shows up, seeing Fitzgerald smothering his father. Hawk starts to call Bridger for help, leading to a struggle with Fitzgerald in which the man stabs Hawk in the abdomen, then letting him bleed out as Glass watches helplessly. Fitzgerald gets rid of Hawk's body and tells Bridger he doesn't know where he went.", "Later that night, Fitzgerald urges Bridger to move on with him, claiming to have seen Ree Indians by the creek. Already having dug a grave for Glass, Fitzgerald forcefully drags him into the hole and partially buries him alive under a pile of dirt as Bridger reluctantly lets him do so.", "Meanwhile, Henry and the rest of the hunting party have a difficult march by as they head towards Fort Kiowa. As Fitzgerald and Bridger head to meet them, Bridger realizes Fitzgerald was lying about having seen the Ree by the creek. He turns his rifle on Fitzgerald, who takes it from Bridger and turns it on him. He pulls the trigger, but the unloaded rifle clicks on an empty chamber. They continue to move.", "Glass awakens and weakly struggles to rise from out of the dirt. He starts crawling his way through the woods to find food and warmth. He finds Hawk's body freezing up from the cold. Glass vows to stay by his son's side. He finds a thick bear pelt to take with him to keep warm. As he continues to move through the woods, he feeds off of roots and old bone marrow. He attempts to build a fire for added warmth and uses some of his leftover gunpowder to seal the wound in his throat. Nearby, the Indians are getting closer, so Glass rides down the rapids to escape them.", "Fitzgerald and Bridger are still walking. They come across a burnt-down settlement with bodies sprawled across the ground. One woman emerges from her burnt hut and sees the men. Bridger quietly leaves some food for her.", "Glass is getting colder and hungrier. He walks into the river and eats a live fish. He walks up a hill and sees a Pawnee Indian feeding off the carcass of a bison. Glass approaches him cautiously and gestures for food. The Indian throws him an organ, which Glass eats ravenously. In the morning, the Indian observes the bear wounds on Glass' body, which are starting to rot. Glass says his men left him for dead and killed his son. The Indian states that his own family was killed by a rival Sioux tribe. He is seeking out more Pawnee.", "Fitzgerald and Bridger reach the outpost and rejoin their party. Fitzgerald tells Henry that they couldn't save Glass or Hawk, and he collects his payment. Bridger remains quiet but is upset and refuses a bonus pay.", "Glass and the Indian move forward. They spend the evening sitting and catching snow in their mouths, the first time Glass has looked peaceful in a while. The Indian gathers materials for a quick sweat lodge and places a feverish Glass inside. Glass starts hearing his wife's voice, and then sees himself walking toward Hawk before they embrace in an old church. The Pawnee performs a healing ritual for Glass' wounds.", "When Glass wakes up, the Pawnee is gone. A short time later he sees that the Indian has been hanged by the French fur trappers. He infiltrates their camp and witnesses one of the men raping a woman. It is Powaqa (Melaw Nakehk'o). Glass holds the rapist at gunpoint and frees Powaqa. Glass then takes a horse, letting the other horses loose. He rides to a spot in the woods where he builds himself a fire.", "In the morning, the tribe searching for Powaqa starts to attack. Glass holds them off with his rifle before he mounts his horse and rides away. The tribe follows him on their horses up to a cliff where Glass and his horse fall over the edge. The horse dies, and Glass is injured again. As the night falls and the cold intensifies, he cuts the horse open, removes its organs, and bunks inside its carcass for warmth. When he wakes up, he gets out of the carcass and moves to a snow cave. In there, he carves \"Fitzgerald killed my son.\"", "Sometime later at the outpost, one of the French hunters arrives with Glass' canteen, which Bridger left on the dirt pile after Fitzgerald buried him. Thinking he took it from Hawk, Henry leads a search party through the woods. There, they find Glass, limping towards them. They bring him back to the outpost. Henry finds that Fitzgerald is gone. The French hunter tells him that he heard Fitzgerald was headed to Texas. What's more is that Fitzgerald cleaned out the party's payroll safe. Henry then confronts Bridger with his rifle and beats the young man to the ground and puts him in the stockade.", "Glass vouches for Bridger's innocence to Henry, stating that he was only following orders. He also tells Henry how he saw Fitzgerald kill his son. Hearing that Fitzgerald is heading for Texas, Glass requests that he seek the man out himself. Henry reluctantly agrees to have Glass join him in the hunt.", "The two encounter Fitzgerald and split up to get him from opposite sides. Henry finds Fitzgerald first and plans to bring him back to be tried for murder. The two men draw their guns on each other, with Fitzgerald killing Henry. Glass finds Henry's body and puts him back on top of his horse using a branch as a prop. They ride on in view of Fitzgerald, who fires his rifle from a distance. He thinks he's killed Glass, but he just shot Henry's body. Glass gets a shot off and wounds Fitzgerald who runs while Glass pursues. They corner each other in the woods, and Fitzgerald shoots at Glass. Fitzgerald runs down by the creek where Glass finds him and they begin to fight. Fitzgerald nearly stabs Glass, but Glass turns the knife on him. Fitzgerald impales Glass' hand, but Glass overpowers him and nearly finishes him off until Fitzgerald states that killing him won't bring his boy back. On the other side of the creek, Glass sees the Indians that have been pursuing him, now with Powaqa. He decides that revenge is in God's hands, so he pushes Fitzgerald into the water and lets him float over to the Indians. The chief grabs Fitzgerald and kills him with his knife. They spare Glass since Powaqa tells them that Glass freed her.", "Although he has gotten his revenge, Glass is alone once again, wandering through the cold land. He falls on his knees and sees a vision of his wife once again walking into the light. The final shot is of Glass' eyes filling up with tears."]},

There his boss, Control (Cyril Cusack), enquires if he is tired, burnt out, ready to come in from the cold. Control suggests that there is a vacancy, a desk job, that might interest him, but Leamas declines adamantly. Thus, Control immediately mentions that he has something out of the ordinary in mind, to target a German Agent called Hans-Dieter Mundt (Peter van Eyck), who is systematically eliminating informants to the West.", "Alec Leamas (Richard Burton) is the operative for the British Secret Service overseeing the field Agents and their activities in Berlin. Recent activities in the field in Berlin and Alec's long-term status in the position make his London-based boss, Control (Cyril Cusack), openly wonder if Alec is burnt out and thus needs to come in from the cold to a London-based desk job. Alec's deteriorating state of mind is what Control wants the enemies to believe, as he asks Alec to do one last job out in the field. Alec is to pretend to become a drunkard who has left the agency due to his perceived failings in the job, working whatever odd jobs he can get, given his previous secret work. This change in attitude would make Alec ripe for turning information to the enemies. What Alec is supposed to do is implicate top East German Agent Hans-Dieter Mundt (Peter van Eyck) as a British double Agent, leading to Mundt being murdered by his own. The Brits expect Mundt's second in command, an East German Jew named Fiedler (Oskar Werner) who hates his ex-Nazi boss, to be the unsuspecting accomplice in this plan. Beyond the regular dangers in Alec being found out, or Mundt being able to convince his masters of his innocence, Alec faces one initially unintended obstacle, namely his relationship with a librarian named Nancy \"Nan\" Perry (Claire Bloom), whom Alec has met during his cover job as a library assistant. She is openly a member of the British Communist Party, but in her idealistic state, sees herself as drunkard Alec's savior. Alec wants to keep her out of what is occurring, which may be difficult, as both sides, while watching Alec's movements, will see their involvement with each other.", "During the Cold War, operative Alec Leamas (Richard Burton) loses his last informant in East Berlin when he is shot while crossing the border. Leamas travels to London to meet his chief, Control (Cyril Cusack). They have a meeting, and Control asks him to lure the East Germans to make them believe that their Agent, Hans-Dieter Mundt (Peter van Eyck) is a double Agent, and use Jewish Agent Fiedler (Oskar Werner), who is under the command of Mundt and hates him, to expose Mundt to get rid of him. Leamas poses as an alcoholic potential defector without any pension who finds a job in a library. Soon he becomes the lover of Nancy \"Nan\" Perry (Claire Bloom), who works with him in the library and belongs to the British Communist Party. Leamas is arrested for fighting in a store, and when he is discharged from jail, an East German Agent recruits him and sends him to the Netherlands. He is then taken to East Germany, where Leamas meets Fiedler, who uses his information to accuse Mundt. Afterward, Mundt is put before a tribunal, but out of the blue, his attorney summons a mysterious witness. Who might be this witness?", "In West Berlin in the early 1960s, at the height of the Cold War, Alec Leamas is a spy in charge of British Intelligence operations in the city. However, his operatives have been hunted down and killed by Mundt, the head of East German counter-espionage. Leamas himself is present at Checkpoint Charlie near the Berlin Wall when he witnesses the last of his agents, Karl Riemeck, being killed as he attempts to escape to the West.", "Leamas is recalled to London by Control, the head of the \"Circus\" (slang for MI6, the British Intelligence service). Control makes little secret of the fact that he sees Leamas' career as over, however he is willing to keep him on for one last operation: to destroy Mundt, something which Leamas is only too happy to do.", "Leamas is later seen apparently out of the service and unemployed. He gets a job at a reference library and starts an affair with Nan Perry, another librarian and a member of the British communist party. Leamas gives the impression of a bitter, broken man and an alcoholic. He later assaults a grocer and spends time in prison.", "After his release from jail, Leamas is approached by a man called Ashe who claims to be part of a charity that supports ex-convicts. Leamas is quick to realise that Ashe and his associate Carlton are East German agents who want him to defect and provide information. Still a heavy drinker and desperate for money, he agrees.", "Leamas later visits George Smiley, another leading official in the \"Circus\", and there he meets Control who briefs him on what he is to tell the Germans. Leamas' defection is part of a long-term plan hatched by the British that will lead the East Germans to believe that Mundt is a traitor and will be executed by his own side.", "Travelling on a false passport, Leamas goes to Holland where he meets Peters, an East German Intelligence official. Leamas tells Peters about what he knows about the \"Circus\" and specifically about Operation \"Rolling Stone\" during which he made payments into Danish and Finnish banks under a false name. The money was later taken out by a \"business partner\", actually an agent working behind the Iron Curtain. Leamas later reads a newspaper article which shows that he is wanted by the police in England. He has no choice now but to agree to actually go to East Germany itself and is taken there by Peters.", "Leamas arrives at a compound where he meets Fiedler, Mundt's deputy in counter-espionage. It's well known that there is little love lost between Mundt, an ex-Nazi, and Fiedler, who is a Jew. Fiedler questions Leamas further about \"Rolling Stone\" and suggests that it was all about secret payments to a spy even higher up in the East German government than Karl Riemeck, who worked for the Presidium of the East German Communist Party. Leamas himself rejects this theory on the grounds that, as head of British Intelligence operations in Germany, he would have been told about all the agents working there.", "Meanwhile in London, Leamas' girlfriend Nan Perry is visited by George Smiley who claims to be a friend of Leamas. She is later invited to East Germany as part of an exchange program between the British and East German Communist Parties.", "One night, Fiedler and Leamas return to the compound where they are arrested by Mundt himself.

At the hearing, Fiedler outlines his case: in 1959, Mundt was part of a trading mission in London, a cover for intelligence work. He killed a man and escaped under the noses of the authorities. Fiedler claims that his escape was too easy and that he only got away when he agreed to supply information to the British, for which he was paid. Fiedler also points out that Karl Riemeck, a proven spy, rose high in the East German civil service thanks to Mundt, thus enabling them to gain access to secrets. When Riemeck came under suspicion, Mundt had him killed to protect himself. Another point is that the money from the bank accounts set up by Leamas in Helsinki and Copenhagen was withdrawn at times when Mundt is known to have been in those cities.", "When Leamas is asked to give evidence he again rejects the idea that Mundt was a spy for Britain because he - Leamas - would have been told. In answer to Mundt's lawyer, he denies ever meeting George Smiley.", "Mundt's lawyer, Karden, claims Leamas was set up by his boss, Control, to defect in order to frame Mundt and get him executed.

Making his way out of the building to a back exit he meets Mundt. Nan is also there waiting next to a car. Mundt gives Leamas instructions on how to get to East Berlin and meet a contact who will get him over the Wall. His escape will give Mundt extra excuses to purge Fiedler and his associates and have them executed.", "During the journey by car, Leamas tells a confused Nan what's really been going on, the truth that he himself has only just realised: Mundt is a spy for the British and Fiedler was closing in on him. Rather than just have Fiedler killed, Smiley and Control decided to discredit him and his evidence as well. Leamas was used to make Fiedler's case and Nan to undermine it. Thus Fiedler will die for trying to incriminate a senior intelligence officer and Mundt will be able to resume his work as a double agent.", "When Nan berates him for causing the execution of Fiedler who was guilty of nothing, Leamas tells her that London needs Mundt in order to protect the West and the freedoms people like her take for granted:", "\"What the hell do you think spies are? Moral philosophers measuring everything they do against the word of God or Karl Marx? They're not. They're just a bunch of seedy, squalid bastards like me. Little men, drunkards, queers, hen-pecked husbands, civil servants playing cowboys and Indians to brighten their rotten little lives. Do you think they sit like monks in a cell, balancing right against wrong? Yesterday I would've killed Mundt because I thought him evil and an enemy, but not today. Today he's evil and my friend. London needs him. They need him so that the great moronic masses you admire so much can sleep soundly in their flea-bitten beds again. They need him for the safety of ordinary crummy people like you and me.\" He also points out that her own Communist beliefs have their own share of evils: \"There's a few million bodies on that path.\"", "In East Berlin, Leamas and Nan meet a contact who directs them to a section of the Wall over which they can escape to the West. But as they climb over it, the contact takes aim with a rifle and kills Nan, who now knows too much about Mundt to be kept alive.", "A shocked Leamas sees Nan collapse to the bottom of the Wall on the Eastern side. At that moment, Smiley himself calls from the Western side for Leamas to hurry and get over the Wall.

A middle-aged widowed eccentric, Beatrice is looking for her life in the classified ads while all about her is the rubble of an unkempt house. All she needs is the right opportunity, she says puffing on a cigarette. Poorly equipped to survive the vagaries of modern life, she has nonetheless always managed to muddle through. Ruth, epileptic and making her way through the rebellious phase of adolescence, seems doomed to make the same mistakes as her mother. Quiet Matilda, on the other hand, seeks refuge in her animals and her schoolwork. \"Jesus, don't you hate the world, Matilda?\" Beatrice asks her youngest daughter. The title of the film is also the subject of Matilda's science project at school and serves as a metaphor for the way life affects each of us differently -- how some are able to find opportunity in adversity and thrive and how some succumb when the burden becomes too heavy. This is the story of slowly drowning and grasping desperately for a lifeline only to find that there's none there and you must save yourself. \"No, Mama,\" Matilda says, \"I don't hate the world.\" (Nell Potts, who stars as Matilda, is the stage name of Eleanor Newman -- Joanne Woodward's real-life daughter. She also appeared as the young Rachel in *Rachel, Rachel*.)", "Widowed Beatrice Hunsdorfer is miserable in her life, and in turn she has contempt for everyone around her. She blames everyone except herself for her problems, but most specifically her now deceased husband George who left her before he died. People who know her believe she's crazy. She dreams of a better life - mostly by wanting to open a tea room where she would sell what she believes would be her world famous cheesecake - while realistically not being able to achieve that dream as she lounges around her run down and unkempt house smoking, drinking, reading the personal ads in the newspaper, and somewhat taking care of her elderly boarder, which is how she makes ends meet. Her eldest daughter, Ruth Hunsdorfer, knows the reputation her mother has around town. Although she displays some teen-aged bravada, Ruth seems destined to be just like her mother. Beatrice's younger daughter, Matilda 'Tillie' Hunsdorfer, is the quiet, shy but intelligent offspring. Tillie is supported by her teacher, Mr. Goodman, in achieving academic excellence. The dysfunctional family dynamic is placed to the test in the lead up to the school's science fair awards ceremony, where Tillie's project on the effect of gamma rays on man-in-the-moon marigold seeds is one of five shortlisted for the grand prize, the resulting seedlings which seem to mirror the Hunsdorfer family itself."]},

His colleague Pecqueux, who admits he has a wandering eye despite being happily married, laments Lantier's loner status, Lantier in return saying he married to his locomotive, which he's named Lison. This loner status is only a front, his so-called marriage to Lison largely meant as a distraction to keep his mind away from human romantic love which he believes cannot be part of his life. While Lantier is on a personal train trip in an extended layover in Le Havre, the murder of an elderly man named Grandmorin is committed aboard the sparsely occupied train. In not mentioning what he saw to the authorities, Lantier covers for who he believes committed the murder, namely Roubaud, the La Havre stationmaster, and his innocent looking wife, Séverine. They did indeed commit the murder, it orchestrated by Roubaud in having discovered Séverine's affair with Grandmorin, her godfather, the murder committed by both meant to tie them together emotionally in keeping this secret. Conversely, Lantier didn't divulge to the authorities what he saw in his feelings of love for Séverine from afar. While Lantier protecting the Rombauds was not meant to lead to anything, it does lead to an emotional bond between himself and Séverine, the two who embark on an affair of their own in Séverine knowing that the murder has only further torn her marriage apart. Fearing for her life at the hands of her husband who has become more and more despondent, Séverine tries to convince Lantier to kill Rombaud before he kills her. What happens is affected by Lantier's secret about himself and why he didn't see love in his life."]},

The calls are just the latest trouble for Jess, who is pregnant and who doesn't want to tell her sensitive but volatile boyfriend, music student Peter Smythe. For this latest call, which is a bit more elaborate than those previous, Barb decides to make a snide comment in return, which provokes a threat by Billy. The next morning, one of the girls goes missing. The desk sergeant at the police station doesn't think much about this as a missing person case, especially as the police are already dealing with another missing person case (a thirteen year old girl named Janice Quaife). The police don't act until more information is brought to the attention of Lieutenant Kenneth Fuller by Clare's boyfriend, Chris Hayden. As Lt. Fuller and his men investigate, which includes placing a wire tap on the sorority house phones, more and more incidents happen to those living at the sorority house. In addition, the obscene calls continue and increasingly have a personal connotation to one of the girls, which includes information that could only be known by those involved. Or is there another reason why the caller knows so much about the specific girl in question?", "Olivia Hussey and Margot Kidder star among an ill-fated houseful of sorority sisters celebrating the holiday season.

There is a Christmas party underway in one of the sorority houses, a large converted mansion. The sorority sisters and many of their boyfriends are inside. Outside in the snow, a point-of-view shot illustrates someone looking into the windows. The person breathes heavily and seems to be a man, but this is all we can tell. The person prowls around before climbing a rose trellis and entering the house through an attic window. He then climbs down through the attic trap door and lurks in the upstairs of the house, watching the girls downstairs.", "One of the sorority sisters, Barb Coard (Margot Kidder), receives a phone call from her mother. Barb seems to have been planning on going home over the Christmas holiday, but her mother has made plans to go away with her latest boyfriend. Barb calls her mother a gold-plated whore and says she'll make other plans for the break. She asks fellow sorority sisters Phyllis Carlson (Andrea Martin) and Jessica Bradford (Olivia Hussey) to go skiing with her instead. Jess also gets a phone call from her boyfriend, Peter (Kier Dullea), an aspiring concert pianist. She seems tense and wants to talk to Peter about something important. She says she'll see him tomorrow at the rehearsal studio. After their boyfriends leave, the girls get another phone call; Jess answers the phone and announces to all the other girls that its \"The Moaner\". Together they listen to the bizarre phone call, which starts out with simply heavy breathing and then\nescalates into strange ranting and obscene language. Barb gets on the receiver and bawls out the caller, firing back with her own obscene comments, until the caller suddenly lowers his voice and says \"I'm going to kill you.\" He then hangs up.", "A sorority sister named Clare Harrison (Lynne Griffin) seems more timid than the others. She questions Barb's judgment in provoking an unstable individual, and reminds her that a girl from town was raped recently by an unknown assailant. Barb reacts angrily and upsets Clare, who then goes upstairs to pack; her father is picking her up the next day to take her home for Christmas. Clare finds Claude, the house mother's cat, in her room, even though the door is closed. She is unaware the killer is watching her from within her closet. In a morbid twist, the psychopath meows like Claude and lures Clare into the closet, where he lunges at her and wraps plastic cleaning bags around her head, smothering her to death. He then carries her body up into the attic and places it in a rocking chair by the window, the plastic bag still over her head. He places a doll in her lap and refers to her as Agnes.", "Downstairs, the other girls are oblivious to Clare's death, and they welcome in the house mother, Mrs. Mac (Marian Waldman), who seems to have just returned from shopping. They present her with a Christmas gift: a frilly nightgown. She pretends to like it but makes sarcastic remarks about it (and the girls themselves) while she is alone. Mrs. Mac goes to the library and seeks a book--\"B for Booze!\"--and hidden inside of it is a bottle of brandy, from which she takes a secret drink. She later fishes a bottle out of the toilet tank in her bathroom, as well, and rinses her mouth with booze after brushing her teeth.", "The next day, Clare's father (James Edmond) comes to collect her, but she is not at the appointed place. When he seeks her at the sorority house, he is shocked by the sexually suggestive posters he finds in her room, and also surprised that she has a boy's photo next to her bed (her boyfriend, Chris). Mr. Harrison seems to blame Mrs. Mac for the permissive attitude in the house. Mrs. Mac assures him that Clare is a good girl, and that she's probably just at one of the fraternity houses visiting Chris. Mr. Harrison offers to drop Mrs. Mac off at the store on his way there. Before they leave, Mrs. Mac hears Claude meowing but cannot find him; he is in the attic.", "Jess visits Peter while he is practicing for a very important audition, and she breaks some news to him: she is unexpectedly pregnant. Peter thinks it's good news, but Jess admits that she wasnt even going to tell Peter about it. Jess intends to get an abortion.

Barb has a bottle of wine and is getting drunk, and she gives one of the children sips of her alcohol. Mr. Harrison phones home and assures his wife that they will find Clare.", "Back at the sorority house, Jess receives another obscene phone call. This one is more elaborate; the killer speaks in several different voices and makes references to \"Agnes\" and \"Billy\". He also seems to be speaking in the voices of two adults, presumably the parents of Agnes and Billy. The voices even seem to overlap at times, adding to the unsettling effect. Jess is upset, especially after her confrontation with Peter.", "Phyl and Barb take Mr. Harrison to the police station to report Clare missing. The officer on duty at the desk, Sgt. Nash (Douglas McGrath), endures hostility from Barb about the incident. Sgt. Nash tells Mr. Harrison that hes sure Clare is just somewhere with Chris. Sgt. Nash asks Barb for the phone number at the sorority house, and she tells him its Fellatio-20880. \"It's a new exchange, FE\" she explains. Nash, who apparently does not know the meaning of the word fellatio, writes it down and thanks her.", "Back at the sorority house, Mrs. Mac tells Jess that Clare is missing, so Jess goes to see Chris while he is at hockey practice. Chris is furious when Jess tells him that the police are not taking it seriously because they think she's shacked up somewhere with him.", "Peter performs his audition and fails miserably, distraught about the news Jess has given him. The instructors who listen to the recital are shocked that he cannot seem to hit the right notes, and later he destroys the piano after they've gone.", "Chris and Jess appear at the police station and Chris angrily lashes out at Sgt. Nash for having a big mouth (meaning his suggestion that Clare was shacked up with him). Lt. Fuller (John Saxon) overhears and becomes interested in the case--he has already been taking another missing person report from a distraught mother named Mrs. Quaife, whose 13-year-old daughter Janice has suddenly disappeared while on her way home from school.", "Mr. Harrison has dinner with Phyl, Barb, and Mrs. Mac at the sorority house, but Barb is extremely drunk and launches into a vulgar tirade that ends with her lashing out at the others. Barb feels guilty because she was careless to Clare, and she says the others think her disappearance is Barb's fault. Barb's curt suggestion that Clare might be dead shocks Mr. Harrison, and Phyl reacts angrily, telling Barb to go to bed. Barb goes upstairs and leaves them alone. Meanwhile, Jess and Chris come back to the house and tell the others about Janice Quaife's disappearance. A search is underway, and Phyl and Mr. Harrison join them. Mrs. Mac tells them that she's leaving for her sisters house and may not be there when they return. When Jess leaves, Mrs. Mac packs her bags and calls a cab, but she is distracted by sounds from the attic: the killer lures her into the attic by making sounds like the cat. When Mrs. Mac opens the attic door, he swings a large hook at her, designed to pull things up into the attic crawlspace. The hook impales her under her chin and hangs her. Outside, the cabbie becomes impatient and leaves.", "The extensive search of the park turns up a body: Janice Quaife. Jess rushes back to the house, where she receives another frightening phone call from the killer. Again he uses multiple voices and reenacts some weird scenario involving naughty Billy and baby Agnes. This time, Jess calls the police to report the obscene phone calls. As she talks to Sgt. Nash, a figure approaches her from behind and startles her--it is Peter, who has been napping in the house while waiting for Jess to return. Nash does not take Jess's report seriously, although Mr. Harrison is sitting near him in the police station and overhears him talking to Jess about the calls. He and Phyl and Chris tell Lt. Fuller about it, and Lt. Fuller angrily scolds Nash for being so inept.", "Meanwhile, Peter proposes to Jess. He would like to quit the conservatory and marry Jess and be a father to her child. Jess, however, refuses. She does not want to get married or have a child yet, as she has things she wants to accomplish first. Peter becomes hurt and angry, telling Jess that she's talking about killing their baby as if it's like having a wart removed. Jess becomes frightened by his mounting hostility, and tells Peter to leave.", "Just as Peter is walking out, Phyl arrives with Lt. Fuller and a phone company rep named Graham, who puts a tap on the house phone. Fuller notices that Peter seemed angry, and he questions Jess about it. He also looks around Clare's room and asks more questions about her. Graham asks if there is another phone in the house and Fuller tells him that it is a private line belonging to Mrs. Mac and that there have been no obscene phone calls on it, so they don't tap it. Fuller tells Jess that he'll be listening in on all of her phone conversations from the station, and Graham tells her to keep the caller on the line for as long as possible so that he can trace the call. Fuller has also left an officer in a squad car outside to watch the house.", "When he leaves, Phyl begins crying and tells Jess that she's sure Clare is dead. Tired and emotionally exhausted, she goes to bed, and Jess waits for another phone call. Meanwhile, the killer goes into Barb's room and watches her sleeping. Barb, who has asthma, suddenly suffers an attack, and Jess rushes to her aid with an inhaler. Barb tells her that she had a nightmare about a stranger coming into her room. Barb goes back to sleep, and Jess is distracted by a group of Christmas carolers at the front door. The singing masks the sounds of Barb's murder; the killer returns and stabs her to death using a glass ornament near her bed.", "The carolers are suddenly rushed off by a concerned parent who has just found out about the murder of the little girl in the park. Jess hears the phone ringing, and it's the killer. He wails at her in a strange voice, and says \"It's just like having a wart removed!\" before hanging up. Jess is shocked; these are words she used in private to Peter. Lt. Fuller picks up on this but Jess denies that it has any significance. Phyl comes back downstairs and Jess tells her about what just happened; Phyl seems to not think the killer could possibly be Peter, and neither does Jess, but she is not sure. Peter himself calls then, and begs Jess not to kill the baby. This conversation doesn't last long enough to trace, either, but Fuller calls to ask Jess about what they were talking about. Jess admits she's pregnant, and that Peter objects to an abortion, and Fuller seems to think that Peter could be the caller after all. Jess, however, has a revelation: Peter was here at the house with her when one of the calls came through, so it couldnt be Peter calling. Fuller is still suspicious, and he requests Peters records from the Dean of Admissions. He goes to the conservatory and finds the piano violently smashed.", "Jess is convinced that she can now rule out Peter as a suspect, and both she and Phyl are relieved. They have a brief laugh after they are startled by two bumbling men from town who are out looking for the killer. Phyl and Jess go around the house locking all the doors and windows, when Phyl goes into Barb's room. Just inside the door, someone whispers \"Agnes!\" and the door slams shut. Jess tries to find Phyl but the phone rings; its the killer again. This time Jess keeps him on the phone long enough for Graham to trace the calls--they are coming from 6 Belmont Street, the same address as the sorority house itself. Nash radios Fuller with the news, and Fuller realizes the calls are coming from the house mother's phone. He tries to radio the policeman parked outside the sorority house, but the cop is now dead, his throat slit by the killer.

Told mostly in flashbacks while Mark Zuckerberg gives depositions in two lawsuits, the idea of a shareable social information site came to him one night after he hacked into his school's database and published the photos of all the women at the school. One of his roommates, Eduardo Saverin, provides the upfront financing and Zuckerberg deftly outmaneuvers two other students who had a similar idea. The relationship with Saverin deteriorates and he soon finds himself on the outside looking in. All in all, an unflattering picture of all those involved.", "In October 2003, Harvard University student Mark Zuckerberg (", ") has the idea to create a website to rate the attractiveness of female Harvard undergraduates after his girlfriend Erica Albright (", ") breaks up with him in the opening scene at a local bar after a bad date where his ego and abrasiveness brings out the worst in him. Over the course of a single night, a half-drunk Mark hacks into the databases of various residence halls, downloads pictures and names of female students and, using an algorithm for ranking chess players supplied by his best friend Eduardo Saverin (", "), he creates in a few hours a website called \"FaceMash.com\", where male students can interactively choose which of two girls presented at a time is more attractive.", "Mark is punished with six months of academic probation after the traffic to the site brings down parts of Harvard's computer network, and he becomes vilified among most of Harvard's female community. However, the popularity of \"FaceMash\" and the fact that he created it in one night, while drunk, brings him to the attention of Cameron Winklevoss and Tyler Winklevoss (", " and ", "), identical twins and members of Harvard's rowing team, and their business partner Divya Narendra (", "). As a result, he gains a job working for the Winklevoss twins as the programmer of their website, Harvard Connection.", "Soon afterwards, Mark approaches his friend Eduardo and tells him of his idea for what he calls \"Thefacebook\", an online social networking website exclusive to Harvard University students. He explains this would let people share personal and social information securely. Eduardo agrees to help Mark, providing a fee of $1,000 to help start the site. Once complete, they distribute the link to Eduardo's connections at the Phoenix S-K final club, and it quickly becomes popular throughout the student body. When they learn of Thefacebook, the Winklevoss twins and Narendar believe that Zuckerberg stole their idea while simultaneously stalling on their website. Cameron and Divya want to sue Mark for intellectual property theft, but Tyler convinces them they can settle the matter as \"Harvard gentlemen\" without resorting to the courts.", "A few months later, at a lecture by Bill Gates (", "), fellow Harvard University student Christy Lee (", ") introduces herself and her friend Alice (", ") to Eduardo and Mark. She asks that the boys \"Facebook us\", which impresses both of them. The girls invite them to a bar, where they have sex in the toilet. Mark later runs into his ex-girlfriend, Erica, who is not aware of The Facebook's existence because she is not a Harvard University student. Stung by this, Mark decides to expand the site to more schools. Christy, Mark, and Eduardo later return to Mark's room where they outline the structure of the company and their plan for moving forward.", "By the spring of 2004, the Facebook grows in popularity, and it expands to other schools in the Northeastern United States, while the Winklevoss twins and Narendra become angrier at seeing \"their idea\" advance without them. Tyler refuses to sue them, instead accusing Mark of violating the Harvard student Code of Conduct. Through their father's connections they arrange a meeting with Harvard President Larry Summers (", "), who is dismissive and sees no potential value in either a disciplinary action or in a lawsuit against Thefacebook website itself.", "Through Christy Lee, now Eduardo's girlfriend, Eduardo and Mark arrange a meeting with Napster co-founder Sean Parker (", "). When Christy, Mark and Eduardo meet Parker at a trendy Fusion restaurant in New York City, Eduardo becomes skeptical of the eccentric Parker, noting his problematic personal and professional history. Mark, however, is impressed with Parker since he presented a similar vision of Facebook. Although no deals are reached, Parker suggests that they drop \"The\" from Thefacebook to make it simply \"Facebook\".", "That summer, Mark moves the company's base of operation to Palo Alto, California at Parker's suggestion, while Eduardo remains in New York for seeking advertising support. When Eduardo visits from New York, he is angered to find that Parker is living at the house and making business decisions for Facebook. After an argument with Mark, the vindictive Eduardo freezes the company's bank account and returns to New York. Upon returning, Christy and Eduardo argue about his Facebook profile, which still lists him as \"single\". Christy accuses Eduardo of cheating on her and sets fire to a scarf he gave to her as a gift. While Eduardo extinguishes the fire, Mark angrily calls him on the phone about freezing the Facebook bank accounts, and reveals that they have secured money from \"an angel investor\" through Parker's contacts. As a result of Christy's jealousy, Eduardo ends his relationship with her.", "Meanwhile in England, while competing in the Henley Royal Regatta, the Winklevoss twins become outraged that Facebook has expanded to a number of universities there and they finally decide to sue Mark. Eduardo has also discovered the deal he signed with Parker's investors allows them to dilute his share of the company from a third to less than one tenth of one percent, while maintaining the ownership percentage of all other parties. He confronts his erstwhile friend Mark at his new Facebook office in downtown L.A. and announces his intention to sue him.", "Later that night, Parker, along with a number of Facebook interns, is arrested for possession of cocaine during a party thrown on the occasion of Facebook's 1 millionth member. It is strongly implied (but never fully explained) that Mark had anonymously tipped off the police to raid the frat house where the party was held and probably had someone plant drugs at the party to intentionally have Parker and his interns arrested to remove them from the Facebook company.", "In the final scene, a junior lawyer for the defense informs Mark they will be settling with Eduardo, since the sordid details of Facebook's founding and Mark's cynical personality will make a jury highly unsympathetic to him. The film ends with Mark sending a friend request to his former girlfriend Erica on Facebook, and refreshing the page every few seconds waiting for a response that never comes.", "Several final on-screen texts state that the Winklevoss twins agreed to a settlement of $65 million and signed a non-disclosure agreement. They later went on to row in the Beijing Olympics and arrive at sixth place.", "Eduardo received an unknown settlement and has his name placed back on the masthead as Facebook's Co-Founder.", "And that Facebook now has 500 million users in 207 countries and is valued at over $25 billion.

They unload a red telephone box from the back of the truck and install it in the middle of the plaza - leaving its door ajar.", "A human Venus fly trap has been set.", "Shortly afterwards a middle aged suited man sees his son off to school and then decides to go into the telephone box to make a call. He soon finds that the phone is out of order, but while trying it the door has closed behind him. Initially puzzled that the door won't open he then starts to become agitated and tries to force it open to no avail. He doesn't have to wait long before two men walking by on the way to work spot his predicament and fruitlessly try to pull the door open.", "Unfortunately, they can't stick around and have to leave. More people have noticed what's going on and a crowd starts to gather, obviously this is entertainment in a town where nothing much normally happens.", "The mood of the film so far is fairly light-hearted, though it's easy to feel sympathy for the man whose discomfort and embarrassment has become palpable now he's also become an object of curiosity and amusement. The next few minutes are played mainly for laughs as several people, including a couple of policemen, try to pull the phone box door open only to fail and fall over backward with the door handle in their hands.", "The crowd itself becomes a source of curiosity, too--there's a tall man stealing cakes from a tray a boy holds on his head; an old woman is invited to sit on a chair a man was taking somewhere; a couple of workmen stand around with a big mirror; and children taunt the trapped man.", "Symbolism and homages begin to emerge. For instance, we notice that two of the onlookers are women sat chatting and knitting. This is presumably a reference to Madame Defarge who sits knitting while people go their deaths in Charles Dickens' story A Tale Of Two Cities.", "Eventually, a fire truck arrives and the firemen decide to break the glass of the phone box. One of them gets on top of the box and is just about to smash the top glass with a sledgehammer when the phone company truck comes back, its horn beeping for attention.", "The phone company workmen proceed to load the phone box onto their truck. It's at this point that the man inside realizes that something is definitely not right about the whole situation. Despite his obvious panic and gestures to the workmen to get him out, the crowd wave him off with cries of \"Good luck\". Having been so close to escape his fate is getting even more puzzling.", "Like some kind of peculiar mobile freak show, the truck drives through the town with the trapped man eliciting jokes by passers by and lots of friendly waves. Much to his disappointment people continually misunderstand his gestures for help. On the way out of town they come to a halt in traffic and by the side of the road is a funeral party standing around a glass casket containing a corpse on display. This is an unsubtle way of signaling the man's own fate.", "A little later, while stopped at traffic lights another phone company truck pulls up alongside and on it is an identical phone box with a stuck man inside it. Looks of empathy and questioning pass between the two men before the other truck pulls away. Our man then becomes even more panicked and desperately tries to get the workmen's attention to let him out. This is the first indication that something more than just an unlucky accident for one person is at work.", "BEWARE: SPOILERS AHEAD, STOP READING NOW!!!", "A neat touch is when we see a man briefly struggling to get out of a phone box by the side of the road, but in his case the door soon gives way and he walks away little knowing what may have befallen him otherwise.", "So now we know there's a concerted effort going on to capture people. For what purpose we can only guess at but will never find out. Around this time the soundtrack becomes portentous with low register rhythms. Driving out of the town there's one final and meaningful encounter with other people. When the truck has to again stop some circus dwarves near the road look on, and they are the only ones to simply look and not laugh or wave.", "In return the man earnestly looks back at them. Maybe the dwarfs who are used to being stared at because of their appearance identify with the man's situation in which he's an object of curiosity and fun. Then blatant symbolism enters when the camera focuses on a ship in a bottle that one of the dwarfs is holding.", "The journey continues on winding mountain roads, first up and then down. For reasons that aren't obvious a helicopter joins in following the truck from the air.", "Eventually, the final destination gets closer as a tunnel into the mountainside is reached. The helicopter lands just outside and the pilot gets out to wave at the man as he enters the tunnel.", "As the truck continues into an underground complex, the soundtrack changes to sinister chanting in Latin somewhat like that used in The Omen. While driving in, they pass men cleaning out phone boxes, and also a truck going the other way full of empty phone boxes. By this time, the man is more anguished but despite frantically banging on the glass he's continually ignored.", "At this point I started to wonder--are the four workmen a metaphor for the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, or is it just coincidence because four are needed to load and unload the phone box?", "Soon after, the truck yields its unlikely cargo to an overhead crane that takes it away and passes it to a series of conveyor belts. The man's improbable fate is then made clear when he's taken past corpses in identical telephone boxes to his own.", "Coming to a halt the man's phone box is put down next to one containing the other victim he saw earlier. That man has strangled himself with the phone cord rather than endure a drawn-out death.", "It's all over for the man; he now knows it but still makes a last effort of banging on the glass hoping to be let out. Desperately aware that he's doomed the final shot of him is slowly sliding down the glass of his coffin in despair and resignation.", "What started out as an ordinary day for an ordinary man has turned into the kind of thing that nightmares are made of.", "Turning full circle, the film ends back at the plaza, where a shiny new telephone box is installed and its door left open.

It's a wonderful example of efficient, lean horror story\ntelling which squeezes in plenty of thrills and shocks in its 40 minute running time.", "Essentially a European riff on a Twilight Zone style format, the film begins with a team of workmen installing a new public phone box. Later a man\ndrops his boy off at the nearby bus stop and then pauses to make a call...", "But the phone doesn't work and when he tries to exit he finds himself trapped. The filmmaker makes a lot out of the claustrophobic setting in these\nopening scenes, the box is glass on all four sides leaving our victim exposed and embarrassed as a crowd gathers to witness the odd spectacle.\nSmall children taunt him, offering him peanuts and calling him a monkey. Several people offer to help including the police, the local strongman and a\nhandyman with a bag of tools.", "Soon, the telephone crew appears to take the box with our hero inside, loading it onto a flatbed truck as the amused crowd laugh and wave\ngoodbye to the hapless prisoner.", "The film up to this point is presented as a lightweight comedy, with plenty of physical comedy and pratfalls as the crowd attempt, and fail, to break\nthe man out of the phone box. However, once the booth is fixed to the truck, the tone shifts subtly into one of increasing dread.", "First, the man witnesses another guy successfully leaving a similar booth, causing a look of anguish to cross his face. The film is very clever in this\nregard, working almost in a silent movie style. The trapped man can only mouth words and use exaggerated gestures to communicate.", "The truck drives past a funeral in which a young woman can be seen in a glass sided coffin increasing our sense of unease. As the truck pulls up to\na junction alongside another lorry transporting another hapless man-in-a-box our guy can barely keep a grip as we finally have our suspicions\nconfirmed and realize that everything is wrong and something sinister is afoot...", "Who has kidnapped him? Where are they going? What terrible fate is about to befall him?", "The film is a triumph, telling a simple story with an excellent central performance from the lead that has to deliver a huge range of emotions\nthrough body language without turning the whole film into an embarrassing pantomime. The photography sets this apart from the usual TV\nmovie fare and the varied score, which ranges from playful for the comedic opening to apocalyptic during the twisted finale, all help to create a thrill\nride with a shocking ending that will stay with you for a good while afterwards."]},

There, the arrogant commander will soon lock horns with the realistic and sensible second-in-command, Captain Kirby York, who, as an expert in the local Apaches, disagrees with Thursday who wants to make a name for himself in the Arizona frontier. In the end, is it wise to engage in battle when personal glory is all you seek?", "In John Ford's sombre exploration mythologising of American heroes, he slowly reveals the character of Owen Thursday, who sees his new posting to the desolate Fort Apache as a chance to claim the military honour which he believes is rightfully his. Arrogant, obsessed with military form and ultimately self-destructive, Thursday attempts to destroy the Apache chief Cochise after luring him across the border from Mexico, against the advice of his subordinates.", "At sometime in the mid 1870's (the exact date is never given) Lieutenant Colonel Owen Thursday (Henry Fonda) is en route to his new posting in Arizona at Fort Apache. Traveling with the widower Lieutenant Colonel is his daughter, Philadelphia (Shirley Temple). Colonel Thursday is clearly upset at having received this posting. We learn that during the Civil War, Thursday was a brevet General but has lost his promotion since the war and has been floating around the war department since with no one knowing what to do with him.\nWhen Thursday and his daughter arrive at a store on the way to the fort the meet up with recent West Point graduate, Second Lieutenant Michael Shannon O'Rourke (John Agar). Philadelphia is smitten with the young lieutenant. At this point, Sergeants Beaufort, Mulcahy, Quincannon, and Schattuck (Pedro Armendariz, Victor McLaglen, Dick Foran, and Jack Pennick respectively) arrive with a wagon to escort O'Rourke to Fort Apache. O'Rourke offers Thursday a ride to the fort which the Colonel accepts, also starting a running gag where Thursday is unable to remember O'Rourke's name.\nAt Fort Apache we learn that Captain Kirby York (John Wayne), a popular and respected officer, was hoped to take over the regiment. Many are visibly upset at Colonel Thursday's appointment to command, especially Captain Sam Collingwood (George O'Brien) who along with York served under Thursday in the Civil War. Collingwood puts in for a transfer to West Point when Thursday arrives as due to an indecent during the war which is only ever alluded to Collingwood refuses to serve under Thursday again. We then meet Lt. O'Rourke's father, former brevet Major now Sergeant Major and Medal of Honor holder Michael O'Rourke (Ward Bond) and his mother Mary (Irene Rich).\nLt. O'Rourke attempts to take over the training of new recruits but proves unsuccessful as the lieutenant is described as \"... an officer and a gentleman...\" doing work not meant for a gentleman. The four sergeants immediately take over training leading to comedic outcomes. This frees Lt. O'Rourke to call on Philadelphia and spend time with her, much to Philadelphia's delight. Time is also given to show the soldier's wives (Anna Lee, Movita, and Mae Marsh) helping Philadelphia to settle into the Fort.\nIt is learned through exposition that Colonel Thursday would rather be on the northern plains fighting the Lakota or Cheyenne tribes rather than remain in Arizona to contain the Apaches on their reservation. He even dismisses the Apaches as \"digger Indians\" much to York's chagrin. Thursday clearly hungers for glory and will go to any lengths to achieve it. Thursday is also upset at what he sees as Fort Apache's lack of discipline and military protocol. He institutes reforms which, while unpopular, do contribute to better the regiment.\nWhile on a pleasure ride with Philadelphia, Lt. O'Rourke sees smoke on the horizon and finds that a repair team sent out to fix Fort Apache's telegraph lines has been massacred by Apaches. They return to the fort to sound the alarm. Colonel Thursday, while grateful to O'Rourke for protecting his daughter, is angry at the lieutenant for taking his daughter off post without his permission. He later revels that he thinks O'Rourke, as the son of an Irish immigrant, is beneath Philadelphia's social class and thus an unsuitable match.\nThursday sends Lt. O'Rourke out with four men to bury the repair team and finish their job. When a small band of Apaches attack the repair crew, Thursday and York's company spring a trap and drive back the Apache.\nThey then travel to a store managed by Indian Agent Silas Meacham (Grant Withers), fearing for his life. They learn that Meacham, and the Bureau of Indian Affairs in general, are incredibly corrupt and spend money given to them to take care of the Apaches on cheap, shoddy goods. The Apaches, tired of getting poor grade food and cheap whiskey instead of proper meals and tools, have subsequently left the reservation under Cochise (Miguel Inclan). The soldiers also find a cache of Winchesters which Meacham has been illegally selling to the Apaches for even more personal profit. Though Thursday finds Meacham a despicable human being, he is a representative of the US government and entitled to army protection. Thus, Thursday has Meacham taken back to Fort Apache and destroys most of Meacham's supplies.\nCaptain York, who as dealt with Cochise in the past, volunteers to meet with the Apache leader and negotiate the latter's return to the reservation. Succeeding in his enterprise, York returns to the fort during the annual non-commissioned officer's dance to report to Colonel Thursday. Thursday then musters the regiment to intercept Cochise, disarm the Apaches, and escort them by force to the reservation. York argues against this as he promised Cochise fair and humane treatment. Thursday dismisses York's advise and departs to attack Cochise. Not a minute after the troops leave the fort, Captain Collingwood's transfer orders finally arrive but his wife doesn't sent a runner to fetch the Captain, knowing he would rather die than be seen a coward.\nThursday finds himself outsmarted by Cochise but the Apache chief doesn't initially attack. He tries to negotiate with Thursday but the Colonel, hungry for battle, insults Cochise and forces the Apache into battle. Not wanting to share glory with Lt. O'Rourke and York, Thursday orders them to remain behind and defend the wagon train while he leads the bulk of the regiment to attack Cochise.\nRiding into what he believes is the Apache camp, Thursday is ambushed and most of his men killed. Thursday manages to escape to the supply wagons but takes a spare horse from York and returns to the survivors of his command. His return earns the respect of Lt. O'Rourke, his father, York, and Captain Collingwood. Thursday, Sergeant O'Rourke, Collingwood, and the dozen or so other survivors are subsequently massacred by Cochise and his men.\nSeeing Cochise and his band approaching the last company protecting the wagon train, York send O'Rourke to nearby Fort Grant to get reinforcements and \"... marry that girl!\" But Cochise, knowing the York is an honorable man, gives the Captain Thursday's banner and rides away with his people.\nA year or two later, York has been promoted to Lieutenant Colonel and given command of the Fort Apache regiment. Philidephia and Lt. O'Rourke have married and have a son. York interviews a group of reporters about Colonel Thursday. Though York knows Thursday's actions and character have been glorified to the extreme a la Colonel Custer, he goes along with what the reporters believe in order to support the regiment's image and support their actions against a new Apache uprising led by Geronimo."]},

Mitsuhas rules are more concerned with etiquette, not having him taking showers as her (so hell see her naked) and other social cues.

Checking his phone, he notices a text from Ms. Okudera, saying she cant wait to meet him.

Taki quickly gets dressed and races out of his house, racing to meet her.", "Meanwhile, Mitsuha gets ready for her day, using her braid to tie up her hair. She realizes Taki and Ms. Okudera are most likely on their date at that moment. She looks into the mirror and sees that she is crying.

Try as she may, she is beginning to fall for a boy she has never met.", "Taki meets up with Ms. Okudera and go to a nice, if expensive restaurant. Though they both share a mutual crush, Taki is nervous and unsure how to act. His mind is somewhere else. At one point, they look at a photo display, and Taki is taken by a group of shots that remind him of Mitsuhas town. Ms. Okudera comes up to him and pointedly states she became more attracted to him once he starting acting odd, but he has changed again. He has become someone else.

They are curious and charmed by Takis mystery girl, while Taki must be coy about how he met her.", "The trio travel many places but no one knows the town Taki has drawn. About to give up, Taki and his friends stop at a local restaurant.

He tries to show his friends the notes Mitsuha left for him on his phone, only for them to disappear. He doesnt know what to think.", "The trio goes to a local library and sees the reports about the tragedy and the list of the dead. Mitsuha, her sister, and her friends are among the dead. Taki is shocked and heartbroken; he is somehow linked to a dead girl, who died three years ago.", "The three get a hotel room for the night. Tsukasa asks Ms. Okuderas opinion on Takis recent behavior and what he claims about Mitsuha. Ms. Okudera, while admitting it is all strange, notes she always found Taki to be nice, but he became even a better person because of this girl.", "Later that night, Ms. Okudera and Taki talk. She notices a braid on Takis wrist. Taki says he got a few years ago, but he doesn't remember who gave it to him or why, though he wears it often for good luck.", "As he sleeps, Mitsuha calls out to him to remember.", "The next morning, Ms. Okudera wakes up to find a note from Taki to tell them to go home without him. He has to go somewhere first.", "Taki travels to Itomori, and finds his way to the shrine of Mitsuhas family, still intact. He travels inside and finds the sake Mitsuha and her sister left. Taki thinks if he drinks some of her sake, he can make one last connection and perhaps save her.", "Taki drinks some, but as he stands up, he trips and falls. As he does, he takes a journey, and sees all of Mitsuha's life; her birth, happiness with her parents, the birth of her sister, the illness and death of her mother, her fathers abandonment of the family and his duties, her grandmother caring for them, and her death by the comet.", "Taki wakes up in Mitsuha's body. He realizes he has one last chance. Seeing the television, he realizes it is the day of the comet, and the towns destruction. Trying to talk to Hitoha, Hitoha realizes that someone else inhabits her granddaughter, as she had a similar phenomenon happen to her when she was younger. Taki wonders if Mitsuhas family line had these connections. Taki (as Mitsuha) tells Hitoha about the comet but is told no one will believe them.", "Undeterred, Taki finds Mitsuha's friends Katsuhiko and Sayaka and tell them what will happen. Despite doubting what they have been told, they believe her enough to help. They make a plan to knock out the towns power with explosives taken from Katsuhiko's father's construction company. Sayaka then will get on the emergency broadcast station and tell everyone to evacuate to the school, well out of the blast radius of the comet. However, they will need to convince the mayor, Mitsuhas father, of the severity.", "Taki goes to Mitsuha's father, but all the man can see is that his daughter has gone insane and orders her to see a doctor. Enraged, Taki grabs him by the tie and screams, You son of a---but they both stop. Who are you? Mitsuhas father asks, also seeing that his daughter is not standing before him. Nevertheless, the warning falls on deaf ears. Taki, thinking his body with Mitsuha inside is near the Shrine, races up there to meet her.", "Meanwhile, Mitsuha wakes up in Taki's body in the present day and sees the town destroyed. Does that mean I died? she asks.", "Mitsuha remembers the day she went to Tokyo, hoping to meet Taki, thinking that even though they were technically strangers, if they were to meet, they would know their connection. By chance she met him on the train, though he did not recognize her (as their connection would only begin 3 years after her death). Heartbroken, she leaves the train, but Taki senses something and calls out to her. She takes out her braid and flings it to him, asking him to remember her name. She was the one who gave him the braid and thus linked them together.", "Taki and Mitsuha finally are at the shrine, but cannot see each other, being separated by time itself. However, during the Magic Hour in a certain spot, they can finally see each other, and meet for the first time. Taki returns her braid and she ties up her hair. Taki suggests they write each other names on their hands so they wont forget. Taki writes his, but when she goes to write her name, the connection is broken.", "Taki wakes up, back in his body, on the outskirts of the still destroyed Itomori. He cannot remember why he came there, or the name of a girl that haunts him. He heads home to Tokyo.", "Back in the past, Mitsuha, knowing what will happen enacts her plan with her friends. They blow up the power grid with explosives, switching on emergency power. Sayaka then tells the entire town of forest fires in an effort to get people to the school. Though some take heed of the warning, not enough people do. Plus, the Mayor is trying to figure out who is sending out this false warning. Eventually, Sayaka is caught and the warning is turned off. Katsuhiko tells Mitsuha that unless she is able to convince her father, everything is lost.", "Mitsuha begins to run, but becomes increasingly despondent as she cannot remember Takis name. She trips and falls, looking at her hand. She sees that Taki, instead of writing his name, wrote I LOVE YOU instead. Shocked and in tears, she continues to run, before reuniting with her father in a building.", "The comet fragment still hits the town, destroying it.", "5 years later...", "Taki has graduated from high school and college, and is now trying to enter the work force as an architect. However, his passionate and idealistic views on preserving cities in case of disasters make him look foolish to interviewers, which lead him to get few if any offers.", "Taki gets a call from Ms. Okudera, asking to meet up. They catch up, and she mentions they day they went to Itomori. Taki says he doesnt remember much of that day or why he was momentarily obsessed with the town. It turns out that reality has changed. Mitsuha was able to convince her father of the danger. That on top of her daring plan, led to the entire town to be evacuated to an area outside of the blast radius. The town was decimated, yet no one died. Still, Taki has no idea of his connection to averting a tragedy or the girl he help save.", "As they part, Ms. Okudera tells Taki that she hopes he one day finds happiness. Taki notes the same, though it has felt as if he has spent years searching for it, yearning for something, or rather someone.", "In a diner, he hears a couple bicker over wedding plans. We see it is Sayaka and Katsuhiko, who survived thanks to Taki and Mitsuha. Taki feels a momentary feeling of connection, but brushes it off as nothing.", "Taki, not knowing why fully, searches the streets every day for a woman whose hair is tied up with a specific braid.", "At one point, Taki and Mitsuha cross paths in the street, but dont look back, deciding their weird feelings are nothing.", "One day, finally, they see each other on different subways. Though they are not sure why, they feel a connection. After getting off, they scramble around the city, searching for each other. Taki sees a woman at the top of a staircase and passes her by, as she walks down. Once again, they feel a stirring and almost ignore it once more. However, Taki cannot take it anymore and calls out to the woman. It is Mitsuha. He asks if they have met before. Mitsuha looks at him with tears in her eyes. She says that she feels the same way. Simultaneously, they ask, \"Can I ask you your name?\"", "We are left to infer they will recover their memories and finally be together, in love."]},

The prospecting is going well, but Micheal is not having the greatest luck and he resents, what he feels, is being burdened with more than his fair share of domestic duties. There is a degree of boredom, and irritation at being all stuck in one cabin and being so isolated from the outside world. One day, when Michael hasn't returned to the cabin for lunch, a jovial Harky states \"Michael won't be joining us....He lost his appetite due to envy\". Shortly afterwards Michael comes in through the door, in a obviously vile mood. Harky laughingly lifts a tin cup and toasts \"To your health, Mr Dennin.", "Michael shoots Harky and then Dutchy, with a rifle he's holding. Edith jumps on him to stop him, while he's trying to reload. She's able to disarm him, but he begins to choke her. Hans pulls Michael off of Edith and beats him ferociously. Edith has to physically struggle with Hans, in his rage, to stop him from killing Michael. Dutchy is dead but they discover Harky still is still alive. The lay him on a counter. Hans grabs a rifle wanting to shoot Michael. Once again Edith has to fight him to stop him, insisting they can't kill him this way, stating \"Not without the law! - it's a white man!\" A hard freeze has settled in while all this is happening.", "Michael is tied up, being watched by Edith while Hans tries to dig graves, struggling for hours in the ice-hard ground. Meanwhile - back at the cabin - Michael taunts Edith saying he'll \"...kill them all someday, anyway.\" Edith discovers Harky has succumbed to his wounds. She reads her Bible, trying unsuccessfully, to comfort herself. No sooner does Hans finish digging the graves, when it begins to rain heavily. Hans fears the graves will flood if the bodies aren't buried soon, so they go out into, what is now violent wind and rain storm, struggling to complete the grim task. In their absence Micheal tries to escape. Unable to loose or cut his rope bonds, he crawls out of the cabin looking for sharper implements. He only manages to make it down the cabin stairs when Edith and Hans return, they discover Michael and take him back in.", "Water has now covered the icy land and they are completely unable to leave. Days go by with one of them always sitting close by with the rifle, but Michael constantly taunts them, and looking to escape, if his exhausted guards fall asleep. Tension mounts, leading Edith into deep anxiety and weeping, and Hans becoming more angry with Edith, blaming her for their plight. Ice dams on the Yukon river begin to break apart, sending torrents of water and ice across the plain and flooding the cabin. At one point Michael kicks a candle off the window sill setting his bed on fire, but Hans quickly extinguishes the flames, and everyone's anxiety worsens. Soon the waters recede somewhat, a bird begins to sing in a nearby tree, and Hans go out to assess their ability to leave. We learn it is Edith's birthday and Michael tells Edith he wants to give her something, and asks her to pull it out of his pants pocket. Edith is wary but Michael assures her he only wants to give her a gift. It is a beautiful and obviously expensive watch. Though Edith is unsure, Michael insists she keep it and she tucks it in her blouse. When Hans returns Edith wants Michael to be able to sit at the table and eat, so they tie him to a post, with his hands free. She puts a sad looking cake on the table, and they all put candles on it. Once the candles are lit, Edith asks Micheal why he tried to kill them all. Michael explains \"It seemed so terribly simple\". We see a tender scene of Micheal presenting his elderly and destitute mother with bags of gold. He jokingly chides her, saying \"And you always said I'd end up on the gallows.\", then she joyfully embraces him. The touching fantasy fades from the screen. The three sit solemn and silent at the table, as the candles melt down, ruining the cake.", "Days to go on with them still unable to get through the flooded plain, but there are emerging dry spaces around the cabin. When Hans can no longer endure their plight, Edith says Hans and she must put Michael on trial, as they have no idea when they will be able to take him to face justice. As Michael is Irish and Edith English, Hans hangs a picture of a young and beautiful queen Victoria on the cabin wall and declares they will try him under queen Victoria's law. Edith insists that it must wait until the next day, because it would be wrong to condemn a man on the Sabbath. They first sit as judges, then give testimony as witnesses, while the other writes it all down, and finally as a jury they decide Michael must die for his crime. Michael offers no resistance through the trial, at the pronouncement of hanging, or when they take him to a tree to be hanged. He mounts a tall box, by himself, for Edith to put the noose around his neck. Edith stands next to him and prays that \"God will accept a repentant sinner.\" Edith climbs down, she and Hans push the box out from under Michael, watch his body swinging, and then both collapse under the emotional weight of it all. Hans has to half carry - half drag Edith back to the cabin.", "Later we see Edith and Hans at night, in the cabin, while it pours rain outside. They are both still very distraught over what they have done, and sit silently being overtaken by dread and terror. Slowly the cabin door begins to swing open, letting in the roaring rain. Edith and Hans stare at the door in horror, as a drenched and dripping Michael slowly steps in, with a wild look on his face, a broken noose still hanging around his neck. He menacingly approaches, gathers up all the gold in the cabin, and slowly backs out, taking the noose from around his neck, tossing it towards them. \"For luck\" he sneers as he leaves.

Beynon is able to get Doc released, the sale price being for Doc to plan and execute a robbery at a small bank branch in Beacon City, Texas where Beynon knows that $750,000 will be kept in the vault for the next two weeks. Rather than Doc using his own men for the job, Beynon directs that the only other people involved will be the men of his own choosing, Rudy and Frank. There are to be no casualties, which is all right with Doc who is not a murderer. After the robbery is completed and the monies divvied up accordingly, Doc and Carol will cross the border into Mexico to live out their lives away from capture. The robbery doesn't go according to Doc's plan, and Doc and Carol go on the run making their way into Mexico with their share of the loot. Various people are in their pursuit, some who know that they will try to cross into Mexico at one of the two major West Texas border crossings. Other bystanders get directly or indirectly involved in the proceedings; two of those people, seeming straight-laced couple Fran and Harold Clinton, get much more intimately involved than the others.

While Rudy and Frank purchase the necessary supplies, Doc and Carol scope the bank, drawing up a timetable for the robbery based on the arrival of employees.

At this point, Doc does not trust these men but has no choice but to go forward with their plan.", "On the day of the robbery, explosives are placed underneath an abandoned house on the outskirts of town as a diversion.

On the morning of his first day of school, an excited Nemo wakes his father, flapping his tiny right fin wildly. Marlin helps him prepare for the day, showing to be overprotective and doubtful of Nemo's ability to take care of himself. Marlin escorts Nemo to school -- along the way, Nemo asks Marlin how old sea turtles live to be; Marlin doesn't have an answer. Mr. Ray (", "), the local teacher, takes the children on a field trip.

During this time, Dory reveals that she can read human words before she and Marlin take refuge in a torpedo well. Dory releases the torpedo which wedges in Bruce's mouth, giving Marlin enough time to grab the mask and flee back into the well.

During the chaos and blinded temporarily by the dust, Dory accidentally drops the mask into the darkness below. Marlin gives it up for lost but Dory cheerfully takes him into the depths, telling him to just keep swimming. After a moment, they come upon a mysterious and alluring light which, unfortunately, belongs to a hungry anglerfish. During the chase, Marlin finds the mask and distracts the anglerfish long enough so that Dory can read the address written on it. Marlin then leads the anglerfish towards the mask and traps it using the masks strap as a tether. Dory recites the address 'P.

Wannahockaloogie) where the other fish perform an initiation to include Nemo in their club, giving him the nickname \"Shark Bait.\" Gill then proposes a plan to escape the fish tank by jamming the gear in the filter which would cause the tank to become so dirty that the dentist will have to manually clean it and place the fish in baggies on the counter, allowing them to roll out the window to the street, cross it, and land in the harbor.

As Marlin tends to her, they are suddenly surrounded by a school of larger jellyfish. Finding that the tops don't sting, Marlin and Dory bounce on them as they race out of the school. Marlin makes it out first and, when Dory doesn't appear, goes back in to retrieve her. He finds her unconscious and scarred from the stinging and struggles to carry her out as he is repeatedly stung. He makes it but, stung and exhausted, blacks out as a large shadow descends on him.", "Nemo waits in the fish tank with Gill who is keeping an eye on the dentist for an opportune moment to jam the filter. Noticing Nemo looking at his scars, Gill explains that during his first escape attempt he landed on dental tools, though he was aiming for the toilet. He says that all drains lead to the ocean and that fish weren't meant to live in a tank. Peach cries out that the dentist is going for a bathroom break which cues Nemo to leap into the filter. Gill tosses him a pebble and gives instructions as Nemo wedges the fan, stopping the flow of water. However, as he is moving through the pipe back into the tank, the pebble unhinges and the fan turns on again, sucking Nemo backwards. The other fish hurry and send Nemo a toy kelp strand to grab onto and pull him out. Shaken, Peach asks Gill not to send Nemo in the filter again. Sullen and realizing his plan put Nemo in grave danger, Gill says they're done.", "Meanwhile, Marlin wakes up to find himself resting on the shell of a laid-back sea turtle with a surfer's attitude who introduces himself as Crush (", "). Incredulous, he discovers that he's also riding along the EAC with dozens of other sea turtles and large fish. Marlin is reunited with Dory who sports a scar on her side from the jellyfish stings and meets Crush's son, Squirt (", "). Marlin also meets Crush's spirited son, Squirt. While playing with the other sea turtles, Squirt is accidentally propelled outside the current. Marlin is panicky at first however Crush convinces him that Squirt can handle himself. Squirt is able to swim his way back into the current & gleefully joins his father. Marlin sees that even the youngest among the turtles can learn to survive in the ocean. Having been told some details of their journey and the encounter with the jellyfish, Squirt and the other hatchlings ask Marlin to tell them the rest of the story. Hesitant at first, Marlin relents and begins with when Nemo was abducted. His story is not ignored; it's passed on from turtle to fish to dolphin to bird and onward until it reaches Nigel the pelican. Hearing Nemo's name, he flies off to the dentist's office. There, Nemo tries to apologize to Gill for the botched escape attempt but Gill says that his eagerness to escape almost cost Nemo his life and that nothing should be worth that. Nigel arrives, crashing into the closed window, but recovers and is able to tell Nemo the story of Marlin's journey as it was told to him. When Nigel suggests that Nemo's father took on three sharks and a school of jellyfish, Nemo is newly impressed with his father. Invigorated, Nemo takes it upon himself to try the filter attempt again and, this time, succeeds.", "Marlin and Dory continue along the EAC until they come to their exit point where Crush and Squirt show them where to depart the main line. After a confusing instructional speech on \"proper exiting technique\" Squirt pushes them into the exit flume and back into open water. Thanking Crush, Marlin asks the turtle how old he is; Crush answers that's he's \"150 years old & still young!\" They are instructed to continue through a large purplish plume of plankton to Sydney. However, they soon become lost and Dory resolves to ask a distant fish for directions. Though Marlin is afraid at first, he decides to trust Dory and she calls out to the distant figure. When she sees its a minke whale, she starts speaking 'whale', asking for help. Marlin grows frustrated with her again just as a whale approaches from behind and pulls them into its mouth.", "Back in the fish tank, a couple of days' worth without a filter has rendered every surface covered in green algae. When the dentist sees this, he opts to clean the tank the following morning before Darla's arrival. Nemo looks out the window to the harbor outside, wondering if his father is there already, waiting for him.", "In the whale's mouth, Marlin and Dory remain safe with enough water to swim in. Though Dory is complacent, Marlin futilely attempts to break out by ramming into the whale's baleen. He yells at Dory for claiming to have spoken whale, calling her insane and lamenting over the fact that he'll never see his son again. Dory tries to console him as the whale emits a call and the water in the mouth begins to drain. The whale then lifts his tongue to push Marlin and Dory to the back of its throat but Marlin refuses to let go until Dory assures him that, though she doesn't know what will happen, everything will be all right. Marlin closes his eyes and releases his grip on the whale's tongue. They fall to the back of the throat where they are then shot out of the whale's blowhole, landing in Sydney Harbor. Overjoyed to have finally arrived, Marlin sends his thanks to the whale and encourages Dory to help him find the boat that took Nemo.", "The following morning, Peach wakes up with the horrified realization that the tank is suddenly clean. The fish find that the dentist had installed a new high-tech filter the night before and, though they are impressed with the fluid functionality of the device, they worry about what they will do when Darla arrives. The dentist suddenly pulls Nemo up in a fish net but Gill and the other fish swim into it and instruct Nemo to swim down, pulling the net into the tank and away from the dentist's grip. Despite their efforts, Nemo is quickly scooped up in a plastic bag and set on the counter. The other fish tell Nemo to roll out the window but, before he can get far, the dentist places the baggie in a tin to keep him from moving. Gill tries to assure Nemo that he'll be OK but, at that moment, Darla (", ") crashes into the office.", "Marlin and Dory continue to search the harbor, both tired from looking at boats all night, when they are scooped up in the beak of a pelican. The pelican lands on a nearby dock and swallows them but Marlin refuses to have come this far just to be breakfast. He lodges himself and Dory in the pelican's neck, causing it to start choking. Nearby, Nigel wakes from a nap to notice the pelican, Jerry, choking and flies down to assist. He hits Jerry in the back, expelling Marlin and Dory from his mouth onto the dock where Marlin shouts out that he needs to find Nemo. Recognizing the name, Nigel turns to Jerry excitedly and tells him this is the fish that they've been hearing about. When he turns back to Marlin, he sees that he and Dory have flopped their way towards the end of the dock. Nigel chases after them but they are all forced to freeze when they notice that they are surrounded by hungry seagulls. When Nigel tells Marlin that he knows his son, Nemo, Marlin flips in excitement, causing the seagulls to rush forward, but Nigel manages to take Dory and Marlin in his mouth and fly off.", "Darla torments the fish in the tank before going in to see her uncle. As he picks up the baggie with Nemo inside, he notices Nemo floating upside down. The other fish quickly realize that Nemo is feigning death so that he can be flushed down the toilet but the dentist moves towards the trash can just as Nigel arrives in the window. Marlin forces Nigel into the office and the dentist drops the baggie. Marlin sees Nemo floating and believes him to be dead as the dentist grabs Nigel and forces him out the window again, Marlin calling out to Nemo. Hearing his name, Nemo pops upright but Darla takes the bag and starts shaking it, trying to 'wake up the fishy'. Gill lodges himself into the top of Mt. Wannahockaloogie and the force of the bubbles propels him out of the tank. He lands on Darla's head and she drops Nemo's bag on a table full of tools, breaking the plastic. Gill falls off Darla's head next to Nemo and flips him into the sink and down the drain using a magnifying scope as a catapult. The dentist quickly puts Gill back into the tank where he can breathe. Gill tells the others not to worry about Nemo; that all drains lead to the ocean. Darla is upset and receives a squirt of water in her face from the sink.", "Nemo travels down the piping until he reaches a water treatment filtration, a series of piping that travels on the sea floor out of the harbor. Nigel flies out of the harbor with Marlin and Dory and releases them into the water, offering his condolences. Distraught, Marlin thanks Dory for helping him and begins to swim away. She asks him to stay with her and that her memory is better when he's around, that she doesn't want to forget. Marlin refuses and swims away, leaving her alone.", "Nemo emerges from the piping and calls out for his father. He finds Dory swimming confusedly under a buoy, saying that she's lost someone but can't remember. Nemo offers to search with her and Dory happily complies, though she doesn't recognize him. As they swim together, Dory comes upon a piece of piping and reads 'Sydney' on it. Suddenly, all of her memories come flooding back to her and she rushes at Nemo, hugging him fiercely, before leading him in the direction Marlin went. They find out that Marlin headed towards fishing grounds and reunite with him amongst a large school of fish. The school of fish then cries out in panic as a large net from a fishing boat above envelopes them. Dory is caught up in the netting and Nemo says that he must swim in and instruct the fish to swim down. Though Marlin fears for Nemo's safety, he lets go and allows Nemo to do what he can. Marlin instructs the panicked fish from outside the net and they all soon start swimming in synch downwards, pulling the net with them until it finally snaps away from the boat, freeing all the fish. Marlin and Dory find Nemo under the heavy netting -- Marlin is stricken with grief, believing Nemo is dead. Nemo regains consciousness & Marlin gently tells him that he found out that sea turtles live to be 150 years old.", "Marlin and Nemo come to an understanding and all three go back to their home in the reef. Marlin's demeanor has changed for the better and he is more upbeat and confident in his son's abilities. He takes him to school where Dory is dropped off by Bruce, Anchor, and Chum who have included Dory in their vegetarian program. Nemo hugs his father before heading off on another field trip with Mr. Ray. Marlin watches them leave, knowing that his son will be all right.", "Back at the dental office in Sydney, the dentist curses the high-tech filter which has suddenly stopped working. He complains about having to put all the fish in baggies but notices that they have mysteriously disappeared from the counter. Horns honk out the open window as Peach is the last to cross the street and land herself in the harbor with the other fish. As they float in their baggies, unable to escape confinement, Bloat wonders 'Now what?'", "In a post-credits stinger, the tiny fish that was Chum's \"friend\" at the support group is stalked by the anglerfish.

But his machinations hurt more than just Terry.", "The Footlights Club is a women's theatrical rooming house in New York City. It is the residence for many a struggling actress, most who can barely make ends meet, hence the reason that they decide to live in the inexpensive club with cramped quarters, shared bathroom and the bad lamb stew for dinners. Elderly Catherine Luther lives there solely to be able to relive her past minor glories on the stage with her younger, inexperienced house-mates. Judy Canfield tolerates dating who she considers a boor name Milbanks and setting one of the other girls on double blind dates with them solely to get out from meals of bad lamb stew. Talented Kay Hamilton has had one success on Broadway in an Anthony Powell produced play a year ago, but cannot even get into see Powell now. Running out of money and late on rent, forgoing eating in an effort to bargain on the \"board\" part of the rent, she believes she was born to play the lead in Powell's next play, \"Enchanted April\", which she also believes will get her back on her feet if she can only get in to see Powell to get the part. Womanizing Powell is currently dating another of the Footlights' girls, Linda Shaw, who lords her expensive gifts of jewels and furs over the others, but who remains in the shadows on her dates with him because of his married with child status. Into the club comes Terry Randall, who to the others obviously has money, which her roommate, forthright cynical dancer Jean Maitland, believes is from a sugar daddy. Terry's air of superiority and intellectualism also does not sit well with Jean, especially as Terry believes one does not need to study but just be smart to act well. In reality, Terry is an heiress - a fact she does not tell the others - her \"wheat king\" father Henry Sims who does not want her to pursue acting as a career. Unknown to Terry, her father goes about trying to prove that Terry does not have what it takes to become an actress, his action which unwittingly leads to tragedy and for the first time in her life true emotion from Terry."]},

This quest ends up being not quite what he envisioned as he does require the assistance of others to find his footing, and in turn, he amasses friends and acquaintances along the way, some who become more a part of his life than he would have imagined. Perhaps most importantly, some of those people provide him with the knowledge of how to co-exist with some of the many Indian tribes, most importantly the Crow, on whose land in Colorado Jeremiah ultimately decides to build his home.

As with \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,\" one can't help but feel that along with Indians and animals with which he shares the land, \"A brave new world\" will soon rush in and overrun them all.", "The opening scene depicts an early Rocky Mountain riverside trading post bustling with activity. Indians, trappers and traders of all stripes freely mingle. A young ex-soldier named Jeremiah Johnson (Robert Redford), fleeing civilization, equips himself with the needed foodstuffs, gear and pack mule required for life as a solitary mountain man.", "After a short time in the high mountains, Johnson finds himself critically short on both food and basic survival skills. While comically struggling to retrieve an elusive trout from a swift mountain stream, Johnson is startled to discover a bemused Indian brave silently watching him. The brave quietly rides downstream. After failing in his attempt to kindle a warming fire in the deep snow, Johnson comes upon a dead mountain man, frozen against a tree. A note attached to the dead man's coat identifies him as Hatchet Jack and explains that he was mauled and disabled by a grizzly bear. He bequeaths his prized .50-caliber rifle to whoever finds him. Johnson uses the gun to bag his first deer.", "Johnson awakens the next morning to find that his horse has died in the night. He continues through the deep snows on foot, leading his pack mule. He is soon surprised by a venerable old mountain man whose bear hunt he has inadvertently spoiled. The old mountain man, Bear Claw (Will Geer), patiently teaches Johnson the ways of the mountains. While hunting elk, Johnson and Bear Claw are surrounded by a Crow Indian party, but Johnson successfully barters their way out of trouble. The leader of the Crows is the same brave who observed Johnson's abortive fishing attempt earlier.", "After parting with Bear Claw, Johnson comes across a cabin where an Indian band has killed several white settlers. One child survives, along with his grieving, traumatized mother who has clearly gone mad. She frantically places her equally traumatized son in Johnson's charge, apparently intent on killing herself. Since the boy is unable to speak his own name, Johnson names the boy Caleb. As their journey continues, the pair comes across another mountain man, Del Gue (Stefan Gierash), buried up to his neck in burning sand by the same Blackfoot raiding party that attacked the settler cabin. Johnson rescues him and they track down the raiding party, intent on recovering Gue's horses and weapons. Against Johnson's wishes, Gue ambushes the Blackfoot party that night, and the Indians are killed with Johnson's reluctant assistance. Del Gue scalps the dead Blackfeet.", "This works to Johnson's advantage when they are subsequently surrounded by Flathead Indians, who are the Crows' blood enemies.

Del Gue goes his own way, and Johnson leads his newfound family deeper into the wilderness.", "Despite a mute \"stepson\" and a wife he cannot communicate with, Johnson finds fulfillment in his new life.

Johnson is goaded into leading the rescue attempt.", "Once in the high mountains, the party encounters a sacred Crow burial ground blocking a mountain pass. Johnson explains they will have to go around, adding considerable distance to the journey. The cavalry officers are skeptical, explaining that the detour could result in many dead settlers. Against his better judgement, Johnson tells the troopers to stay quiet and follow along in single file through the burial ground. It is of no use; the Indians soon know of the desecration. After locating the wagon train, Johnson parts with the white men and traverses the burial ground again, suddenly becoming spooked. He rushes back to his cabin to find his wife and stepson dead, murdered by the Crows. Johnson is wracked with guilt and grief. After some time, he tenderly places the boy and his wife in the bed, covers them, and sets fire to the cabin.", "Johnson tracks down the murderous group of six or seven Crow warriors and attacks their campsite, without concern for his own life. He wipes out the entire group, becoming wounded in the process. His reprisal invites a seemingly endless series of solitary attacks upon Johnson as he travels the mountains. One by one, the Crow warriors ambush him, only to die in the process. Johnson himself is wounded many times. He becomes a living legend among the Indians and the white settlers alike. During this period, Johnson crosses paths once again with both Bear Claw and Del Gue, who are aware of his predicament. They wish him well and take their leave.", "After months of attacks, a weary Johnson sees one more Crow warrior approaching in the distance. He warily cocks his rifle and readies for a fight. Suddenly, the Indian raises his hand in tribute and in peace. It is over. Johnson breaks into a wide grin- it is the same Crow who watched him struggle to catch a trout long ago."]},

Flashbacks which appear throughout the movie hint that he has either lost everything he has ever wanted and was reduced to taking the job of a car delivery driver as a last resort, or he is (what is called today) an adrenaline junkie. He is a Medal of Honor winning Vietnam veteran, a former law enforcement officer, former race car driver, and former motorcycle racer. He lost his job as a cop apparently after being framed in a drug bust, perhaps in retaliation for preventing his partner from raping a young girl. He seemingly gave up his automobile and motorcycle racing careers after two near-fatal accidents. He flashes back to a girlfriend, first in a snow-covered landscape, then at the California shore.

The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come shows him what he will leave behind after he is gone. Scrooge awakens on Christmas morning, a new man intent on doing good and celebrating the season with all of those around him.", "On his way out of the stock exchange, Mr. Scrooge stops to talk to a pair of businessmen and tells them that Christmas is a humbug. They laugh. He then is stopped by one of his debtors who asks him to extend a debt, but Scrooge refuses. Passing some children singing for pennies in front of his door, he shouts at them to be off.", "Entering his office, two gentlemen await him asking for a contribution for the poor. \"Are there no prisons?\" asks Scrooge, and tells them to leave him alone. He is too busy with his own business to concern himself with the poor. The gentlemen withdraw, and Scrooge's nephew Fred enters. He invites Scrooge to Christmas dinner, but Scrooge refuses. As he leaves, Fred asks Scrooge's clerk, Bob Cratchitt, about his family and they wish each other a Merry Christmas. Meanwhile, Bob's son Tim is at the window of a toyshop admiring the toys. He walks with a crutch, and his mother escorts him home.", "As the working day ends, Scrooge berates his clerk for requesting the entire Christmas day off. He takes his dinner in a tavern and returns to his home, where he sees in his door-knocker the apparition of his old partner, Jacob Marley. He locks himself in his room and takes his gruel by a small fire. Suddenly all of the bells around him begin to ring, and just as suddenly stop. A clanking and banging out on the stairs soon reveal the ghost of Jacob Marley. Scrooge denies believing in the ghost, thinking it is more likely to be an issue with his digestion, but the ghost eventually convinces him. Marley is doomed to walk the earth, unable to help his fellow man, since he never did so when alive. He wears a long chain, and tells Scrooge that his chain will be even longer. Scrooge points out that Marley was a good man of business, but Marley explains that mankind was his business. He offers Scrooge a chance of escaping Marley's fate by the visits of three spirits. He also shows Scrooge through the window the ghosts of many people surrounding a woman and baby shivering in the snow, and explains that they wish to help her but cannot. Scrooge slams the window shut, runs to his bed and hides under the covers.", "When the clock strikes one, Scrooge is awakened by the first ghost, the ghost of Christmas past. He takes Scrooge through time to his old school, where young Scrooge is alone as the other boys have left for Christmas. A knock on the door reveals his sister Fan, who has come to take him home. She promises to care for him as long as she lives, and Scrooge tells her that she must live forever. Older Scrooge tells the spirit that Fan had died giving Fred life, just as Scrooge's mother had died giving him life, a fact for which his father never forgave him.", "The scene changes to a party at Fezziwig's, where Scrooge had been apprenticed. He tells the spirit that the happiness Fezziwig had given them was as great as if it had cost a fortune, a fact that gives Scrooge pause. They look in the corner, where a younger Scrooge is romancing a woman named Alice. As they watch, she accepts his marriage proposal.", "The scene switches again to Fezziwig refusing a buyout offer from a Mr. Snedrick. They want to replace all of the workers with machines. Later, Scrooge visits Fan's deathbed. She asks him to promise her something. Young Scrooge leaves the scene thinking Fan has died, but then older Scrooge learns that she had asked him to take care of her son. Later again, Scrooge has accepted a job offer with Mr. Snedrick, where he meets another clerk, the young Jacob Marley.", "Eventually, Fezziwig is forced to sell his company to Snedrick's firm. Alice confronts Scrooge, telling him he fears the world too much. She tells him that, penniless, he would not seek her out again, and returns his engagement ring.", "Still later, a company owned by a Mr. Jorkin goes under due to his embezzlement. Jorkin is unrepentant and warns that punishing him would not be worth for the scandal that would rock the company, resulting in bankruptcy for all involved. Scrooge and Marley, members of the board, warn that the danger is serious, but while they disagree with Jorkin's methods, they offer to make good Jorkin's debts in return for majority control of the company. The rest of the board protest, but ultimately apparently agreed to the proposal.", "Another Christmas, with Marley dying, Scrooge refuses to go to him until the day's business is concluded. At seven o'clock, he enters Marley's rooms and listens to his breath before Marley wakes. Marley tells him that they had been wrong and that Scrooge should save himself before expiring.", "Scrooge wakes in his own bed, but a voice beckons him from the next room. Investigating, he finds the spirit of Christmas present. They visit miners, and then watch Bob Cratchitt's happy, although small, Christmas celebration. The spirit tells Scrooge that Tim will die if circumstances don't change. Cratchitt announces that he has a situation in mind for his son Peter, and then toasts Mr. Scrooge. The family objects, with Mrs. Cratchitt calling Scrooge hard and stingy. Eventually they relent and reluctantly toast Scrooge.", "Meanwhile, Fred is also toasting Scrooge at his Christmas dinner. He says he feels sorry for Scrooge. Alice, who has become a nurse, takes care of patients at a home. The spirit asks Scrooge if he will profit from the experience, but Scrooge is unsure. The spirit shows Scrooge two children under his care, Want and Ignorance. Scrooge runs, and runs directly into the Spirit of Christmas Yet To Come.", "They visit Cratchitt's house, where Tim has passed away. Bob returns home, after visiting Tim's resting place. They then visit the rag-and-bones man Old Joe, as a laundress, a charwoman, and an undertaker come to pawn their spoils. They discuss the man they'd all stripped, who had been unkind and miserly. Joe gives the undertaker eight shillings and the laundress seventeen and sixpence. The charwoman had taken the bedcurtains from around the corpse and stripped the expensive shirt from it, leaving him to be buried in calico. Moving to the stock exchange, two businessmen discuss the funeral, one insisting on having a lunch provided if he was to attend. Scrooge realizes he is nowhere to be seen. Finally, the spirit takes Scrooge to a cemetery, where he sees his own name on a tombstone. Once again Scrooge wakes in his own bed.", "The charwoman knocks and enters, and tells him that it is still Christmas day. Scrooge tells her that he feels as light as a feather and as giddy as a school boy, but when he tries to stand on his head in his nightshirt she runs out screaming. He chases her out and gives her a guinea as a Christmas present. Hearing bells, he runs to the window and opens it. Seeing a small boy run past, he tells him to buy a large prize turkey from a butcher and sends it to the Cratchitts. They puzzle over who could have sent it, but Tim suspects Scrooge. Scrooge then visits his nephew for dinner. Unsure of his welcome but gently prodded by the housekeeper whom he treated cordially just then, he enters to the strains of \"Barbara Allen.\" With delight undiminished by his conversation with Ebenezer the previous day, Fred welcomes him in and Scrooge asks Fred's wife for forgiveness. She warmly accepts and they dance a polka together.", "The next day, Scrooge arrives at the countinghouse. Cratchitt shows up a full fifteen minutes late, and tries to sneak in. Scrooge calls him into his office. Cratchitt, expecting to be fired, apologizes profusely; but instead Scrooge tells him he is raising Cratchett's salary, and tells him to go out and buy a new coal scuttle.", "In the final scene, the Narrator notes that Scrooge was better than his word and is now respected and admired throughout London as a changed man who knows how best to keep Christmas in his heart, if any man possesses the knowledge. Tim is shown running to Scrooge, no longer limping."]},

Rodin realizes that what they need is a foreigner, someone whom no one in France has seen and has no record.", "Three months later, Rodin has succeeded in finding the right individual, an Englishman with a short but impeccable record. He invites him to Vienna for an interview by the three OAS leaders. The Englishman is smart, enigmatic and cold-blooded; he figures out their need for an outsider to assassinate de Gaulle, given the failed prior attempts and the OAS being riddled with informants. He accepts the job, but warns that he'll have to be paid $500,000 for the work, as anyone who does something like this will never be able to work again. He demands utmost secrecy and anonymity, and asks that no one but the four of them know of this project and that he work completely by himself. He takes the codename \"the Jackal\", and takes his leave of the OAS heads; his farewell is observed by Rodins bodyguard and adjutant Victor Wolenski.", "The Jackal begins his preparations: he researches extensively on his target, he acquires two false passports, he pays a visit to Paris to acquire a good shooting location, and he contacts two individuals in Belgium. The first is an armorer whom he commissions to build a special rifle; the second is a forger from whom he requires special French documents.", "Later on, the Jackal receives an OAS contact named Valmy that will inform him of any developments regarding the President. Around the same time, the OAS sends a female agent named Denise to bed a high-ranking French politician. Two weeks after visiting the armorer and forger, he returns to acquire his purchases. He is satisfied with the gun the armorer has made, and a trial of the rifle goes well; the forger on the other hand tries to blackmail him over his papers, and the Jackal snaps his neck.", "All his plans complete, he leaves for France under the name of Paul Oliver Duggan.", "Meanwhile, to raise money to pay the Jackal, the OAS heads order their network to rob a bunch of banks across Paris. The tactics range from late night burglaries to daylight ambushes of armored cars. This sudden crime wave is noticed by the French Action Service (the French espionage branch), and although several of the robbers are captured, they are hired thugs who only know that they've been ordered to carry out these robberies on behalf of the OAS.", "The Action Service's suspicions grow when they learn that Rodin and his associates have suddenly secluded themselves in the Hotel Garibaldi, in Rome, which is owned by an OAS sympathizer. From research by surveillance teams in the area, they observe that Rodin and co. are untouchable. They live alone on the top floor of the hotel, and the floor below that is occupied by their eight bodyguards, highlighting the mens' fear of being kidnapped. So far, their only form of contact with the outside world is Wolenski, who makes twice-daily trips to the post office to send and receive letters. After five weeks, the Action Service decide they need Wolenski taken in for questioning. They abduct him off the street while he's walking to the post office to pick up mail, load him into the back of a truck and drive him to an airfield, where he's then flown to Paris in a small propeller plane. They interrogate and torture him to death, but all they get is that a blond killer named Jackal visited his superiors. This is enough for the chief of the Action Service to conclude that the OAS are employing an outside contract killer as part of a plot to assassinate De Gaulle.", "The French Interior Minister asks for an interview with De Gaulle, but his demand for secrecy is rebuffed; de Gaulle is a proud man who refuses to go into hiding or shield himself. The Interior Minister instead convenes a secret council to deal with the Jackal, which includes high-ranking individuals like Police Commissioner Berthier and Colonel St-Clair. Berthier states that because of the Jackal's anonymity from even his own employers, no one has a clue where to start looking for him; the key to finding and stopping the Jackal thus is to establish his identity. He recommends his own deputy commissioner, Claude Lebel, as the best detective in France and ideal for the job of uncovering the Jackal.", "Lebel, a mild-mannered but tenacious policeman, is summoned to the council. He is given access to every resource available, but he is asked to keep things secret, and that he succeeds. Lebel brings in his assistant Caron to help him out, and the two get to work contacting the heads of police agencies abroad. Meanwhile, St-Clair arrives home and pours out everything about the situation to his mistress, Denise. She later slips off and phones Valmy...", "Over in London, enquiries are being headed by Inspector Thomas, who has been given express authority by the Prime Minister to make full investigations regarding the Jackal (ensuring that he not be English, or if he is to be stopped). The British police come up with two things that they pass over to Lebel. Firstly, that there was a suspicious character named Charles Calthrop who was in the Dominican Republic around the time its dictator Trujillo was assassinated (Jackal in French is \"chacal\", the word formed from the first three letters of each name); a search on Calthrop's home reveals he is absent. Second and more worryingly, a review of all passport applications reveals that one was made for one Paul Oliver Duggan, who had died at the age of two.", "Meanwhile, the Jackal learns from Valmy that his assignment is blown, but decides to continue on regardless. He makes it to a hotel at Grasse, where he spends the night charming and seducing a fellow guest, Baroness Collette de Montpellier.", "The next morning the hotel records are taken and scanned, as is French customs (and more urgently than usual). Presently Duggan's name is spotted and immediately Lebel orders forces on the hotel and he heads over there himself. They find no sign of the Jackal, him having already left the hotel (something Lebel finds strange), but they learn that the Baroness's bed had been slept in by two people. Lebel interviews the Baroness, but she denies knowing a thing about the man.", "The Jackal's quick getaway before the police arrive is cut short by accidentally crashing his car. He decides to head for the Baroness's estate, where she takes him in. That night she tells him the police were looking for him, but promises she wont say anything if he tells her what hes about; in response, he strangles her. He takes on a new disguise and identity of bespectacled Danish pastor Per Lundqvist, whose passport he stole earlier in Heathrow Airport, and quickly but quietly leaves. He heads to Tulle station in the Baroness's car and catches a train to Paris. Hours later, the servants discover the Baroness's body.", "Lebel reports the failure of catching the Jackal and the murder of Madame de Montpellier, and notes that he could not have escaped unless he had been forewarned and that he now has the identity of a Danish pastor (having traced the car to the station and questioned the station authorities). He also notes that the murder means he can do away with secrecy and initiate a public manhunt. A police squad heads to Paris station to intercept the Jackal, but they arrive a few minutes too late. Lebel sends police to check every hotel in Paris, but the Jackal evades them by entering a Turkish bathhouse and being picked up by a French homosexual.", "Lebel uses a phone tap to discern that Denise is the OAS spy that's been tipping off the Jackal. He presents a recording of her phone call to the council, and St-Clair leaves (he later overdoses on sleeping pills); he'd tapped all the phones of the council members, having had suspicions about the Jackal being forewarned. Afterwards, he works out that the Jackal will strike in two days, or August 25, 1963 which is Liberation Day, the anniversary of France's liberation from Nazi Germany. De Gaulle, as a World War II veteran, is sure to make a public appearance on that day no matter what the threat, and the council disbands, intending to make all attempts to find the Jackal before then.", "Meanwhile, the Jackal kills the homosexual when he sees a public broadcast about Per Lundqvist being wanted for murder.", "In the early hours of Liberation Day, the Minister wearily informs Lebel that they've been unable to find the Jackal. All they can do is implement the utmost security precautions around. The day goes on, but nothing happens. Some time later, a gendarme allows the Jackal, disguised as an old one-legged French war veteran, to head to his residential address, after seeing his papers; the Jackal enters his location, sheds his disguise and disassembles his crutch to form his rifle, and waits for the President to present medals to former French Resistance members.", "Lebel strolls around looking for anything the least suspicious or out of place, but he doesn't find anything until he meets the gendarme around the time the President presents medals. He learns that the officer let a cripple with a crutch through, sees that the address pointed out has a window open on the top floor, and rushes over there, ordering the officer to follow him.", "The Jackal aims, takes his shot... and misses because De Gaulle suddenly bends his head to kiss a Resistance soldier on the cheeks, as is French custom. The Jackal reloads his gun for a second shot, but then Lebel and the gendarme burst in on him. He guns down the gendarme, but Lebel snatches up the officers submachine gun and empties it into the Jackal.", "Over in London, Charles Calthrop appears at his flat. The British authorities take him in for questioning, but conclude that he had nothing at all to do with the Jackal and close the matter (also forswearing any responsibility regarding the Jackal, since he was an Englishman but also a Dane and a Frenchman). Thomas ponders who the Jackal really was...", "The film ends with a funeral in Paris: a body is buried in an unmarked grave, with Lebel the only witness."]},

Half-brothers Doughboy (Ice Cube) and Ricky Baker (Morris Chestnut) are foils for each other's personality, presenting very different approaches to the tough lives they face. Ricky is the \"All-American\" athlete, looking to win a football scholarship to USC and seeks salvation through sports, while Doughboy succumbs to the violence, alcohol, and crime surrounding him in his environment, but maintains a strong sense of pride and code of honor. Between these two is their friend Tre Styles (Cuba Gooding, Jr.), who is lucky to have a father, Furious Styles (Laurence Fishburne), to teach him to have the strength of character to do what is right and to always take responsibility for his actions.", "At the age of ten, Tre Styles moves to the inner city to live with his dad, Furious Styles (Laurence Fishburne). The elder Styles is determined to raise his son with self-respect and self-worth, not an easy task in a neighborhood where crime and drugs are rampant. By the age of seventeen, Tre (Cuba Gooding, Jr.) is a level-headed young man who has stayed out of trouble, unlike his friend Doughboy (Ice Cube), who has been in and out of jail several times. His brother hopes a football scholarship will be his way out. Tre works hard to be true to his father and to his friends, but violence, which can change your life in an instant, is something they all have to deal with.", "In South Central Los Angeles, California, Tre Styles lives with his divorced mother Reva Styles (Angela Bassett). When Tre is suspended for three days at school, Reva decides to send him to live in Crenshaw with his father, the businessman Furious Styles (Laurence Fishburne), \"to become a man\". Tre befriends his neighbors, the half-brothers Doughboy and Ricky Baker, and soon they become best friends. Seven years later, Tre (Cuba Gooding, Jr.) is an educated teenager preparing to join the university; Ricky (Morris Chestnut) is an athlete, expecting to join the university with a scholarship, since he is a great football player; and Doughboy (Ice Cube) is a small time criminal that has been arrested several times. But they live in a dangerous neighborhood where dreams are shattered by bullets.", "Black and in their late teens, Tre, Doughboy and Ricky - the latter two half brothers - have hung out together since they were kids, they doing so more after Tre's mother, Reva, seven years ago sent him, bright but adversarial, to live with his father, Furious, in the Crenshaw district of South Central Los Angeles across the street from the other two living with their single mother. The move was for Furious to show Tre what it means to have a sense of responsibility as a black male, especially in an atmosphere of black male violence against each other that pervades their neighborhoods. Furious, an independent financial adviser working in the neighborhood, believes that the urban black problems within which they live, including this violence and crime, is only fostered by the white majority. That move to live with Furious largely resulted in Tre having that responsibility in he now wanting to head off to college for a better life with his Catholic girlfriend Brandi, who has resisted the pressure of having sex in wanting to wait until the \"inevitability\" of she and Tre getting married. Ricky, already married with a child - the marriage because of the baby - is also aiming for a better life for his young family. A high school football star, Ricky is resting his dreams on a football scholarship. However, in not being sure he can meet the minimum SAT requirement of 700, he is sketching out a less than ideal Plan B considering that focus on his young family. Of the three, Doughboy is the one who has fallen into that \"predetermined\" life of crime and violence, he in a gang and having just been released from a stint in prison. Regardless of what the three view as their respective futures, those futures may be affected by the environment in which they live where looking at the wrong person in the wrong way could result in a death sentence.", "The story opens in 1984, focusing on three young black male youths, Tre, Doughboy, and Ricky, as they grow up in South Central, Los Angeles. Tre Styles is an intelligent young student of about age 10, but encounters disciplinary problems at his young age -- he mouths off to his teacher, who gives him the opportunity to lecture on a topic of his choosing. One of his fellow students antagonizes him and he fights with the boy, earning an ejection for the day. His mother Reva Devereaux (Angela Bassett), decides it would be best for her son if Tre were to live with his father, Furious Styles (Laurence Fishburne). Furious is a no-nonsense disciplinarian who teaches his son how to be a man. Tre begins his new life in South Central L.A. and reunites with old friends Doughboy, Ricky, and Little Chris though shortly after being reunited, Doughboy and Chris are arrested for shoplifting from a local convenience store.", "The film skips forward to seven years later in 1991 at a backyard picnic party. The three boys lead very different lives. Tre (Cuba Gooding, Jr.) is a high school senior aspiring to become a college man, Ricky (Morris Chestnut) an All-American football player at the same school, and Doughboy (Ice Cube) a crack dealing gangster and high school dropout. The film offers a keen insight on racial inequality, drugs, sex, and gang violence.", "Doughboy has just been released from prison and spends most of the time hanging out with friends Chris (now confined to a wheelchair), Monster and Dookie. Ricky is a star running back at Crenshaw High School. He has a out-of-wedlock son with his girlfriend Shanice (Alysia Rogers) and is being recruited by the University of Southern California, but needs to earn a minimum SAT score of 700 to receive an athletic scholarship. Tre also attends Crenshaw High School with Ricky and also has a girlfriend, Brandi (Nia Long). Tension exists between the two because he wants to have a sexual relationship with Brandi, who resists the idea because of her Catholic faith.", "Tre is torn by his desire to be a success and live up to his father's expectation and the pull of peer pressure to be more involved in the local gang culture of Doughboy and his crew. The climax of the film depicts Ricky's murder by members of a the local Crips, with whose leader he had a minor conflict, ironically after the audience learns that he has achieved the 700 SAT score necessary to attend USC. Doughboy, Monster, and Dookie intend to avenge Ricky's death. Tre, who is Rickys best friend, takes Furious' gun, but is stopped by him before leaving the house.

Half way through the trip, Tre realizes his father was correct, asks Doughboy to pull the car over, and returns home. Doughboy and his two friends proceed and avenge Ricky's murder, gunning down his killers in cold blood.", "The film ends the following morning with a conversation between Tre and Dough Boy.

There seems to be some recognition between the participants and shots are fired from automatic weapons. A title card states \"One out of every 21 Black-American males will be murdered in their lifetime\", while a second title card states \"Most will die at the hands of another Black Male\". Police radio chatter is heard, reporting a \"187\", the police code for homicide. New voices are heard lamenting the deaths of people close to them.

A young African-American boy, Tre Styles, who lives with his mother in a rough section of Los Angeles, goes to school one day with a few of his friends. One of his friends asks the rest of the kids if they heard a shooting that had taken place nearby the night before. The boy invites the rest of his friends to see the crime scene in front of an abandoned garage. The garage door is riddled with bullet holes and a lot of blood has been spilled on the ground. Tre himself is knowledgeable enough to recognize that the blood has separated into hemoglobin and plasma.", "The kids go to school and are in class listening to their teacher talk to them about the Pilgrims and Thanksgiving. Tre scoffs at the lesson and the teacher invites him up to lecture the class. Tre arrogantly accepts and begins to talk about the continent of Africa, showing an impressive amount of knowledge on the subject. When he suggests that all the races of the world first came from Africa, one of the other students is scornful -- the boy is one of Tre's friends that he walked to school with that morning. Tre strikes the boy with the pointer he'd been using and the two scuffle in the class.", "Tre is sent home. As he walks down his street he passes a bunch of teenagers beating up on another. We also hear, in voiceover, his mother, Reva, talking to his teacher, who says that Tre is quite intelligent and possesses a vast vocabulary but can't seem to control his temper. When the teacher asks if Tre's father lives with them and if Reva is educated, Reva becomes insulted and hostile and tells the teacher that Tre won't be coming back to school because he's going to live with his father, Furious.", "Reva drives Tre to his father's house. On the way, she tells Tre that she doesn't want to see him end up poor, uneducated and living on the streets for the rest of his life. When they get to Furious' house, his mother talks to his father for a brief time and tells Furious that she can't teach Tre to be a mature adult. Tre finds his friends, Chris and Darren (called \"Doughboy\") hanging around his father's house, but isn't allowed to play with them as his father tells him to rake the leaves on the front lawn. Later, Tre and Furious go over the rules of the house and Furious tells Tre he's not being as hard on him as Tre believes, that he's simply trying to teach Tre responsibility. He also mentions that Tre's friends, who are fatherless, will wind up less fortunate than Tre.", "That night a burglar sneaks into Furious' house. Tre gets up to use the bathroom while his father, knowing the thief is in the house, loads his Colt Python and jumps out of the bedroom, firing two quick shots. The leave gaping holes in his front door, and the thief escapes, leaving behind a sneaker. After calling the police, Tre and Furious wait nearly an hour for them to show up. One of the cops, a black man, seems to have a short temper and bristles when Furious tells him they'd been waiting a long time in the cold. Since nothing was actually stolen from the house, the black cop says there's no need to fill out a report. When he tries to be friendly toward Tre, Furious tells Tre to go back inside. The cop angrily asks if Furious has a problem with him; Furious' answer is \"it's too bad you don't know what that is, brother.\"", "The next day, Tre goes to Doughboy's house. Dough's brother, Ricky, is one of Tre's best friends, however, the two brothers have different fathers and their mother clearly favors Ricky. While Tre waits outside, Doughboy's mother berates her son, calling him lazy and stupid. Doughboy walks out and he and Tre wait for Ricky, who carries a football. They're joined by Chris, who asks them if they want to see a dead body. They go to where the corpse is laying and while they stare at it, a group of tough-looking teenagers walk up on them and demand Ricky's football, promising not to keep it. Scared, Ricky gives it to them and it's clear the boys are going to keep it. Doughboy walks over to one of the boys and demands the ball back. When he tries to take it and fails, he kicks the bigger boy in the leg. The boy backhands Doughboy and kicks him. Dough, Tre and Chris all begin to leave. When Ricky looks back at the teenagers, one of them relents and throws the ball back to Ricky. The three friends leave with Doughboy mumbling about going to the store. Ricky tells him he has no money but Dough says he's \"going anyway.\"", "Tre goes fishing with his father. At the ocean, Furious asks his son if he's a leader or a follower. Tre enthusiastically says he's a leader. Furious also asks Tre what he knows about sex. Tre gives a crude explanation and Furious tells him that anyone can have a baby but it takes a \"real man to be a father,\" relating his own experience at becoming Tre's father at the age of 17. He also talks about how he joined the Army and felt discriminated against and that Tre should never consider joining the Army. The two drive back home and see a police car outside Doughboy's house. Dough and Chris are being arrested for shoplifting.", "Seven years later a party is being held at Ricky and Dough's house. Dough has just been released from prison on a charge that isn't explained. Tre goes to the party and meets Dough. Dough and Ricky's mother, Brenda, talks to Tre and asks him to talk to Dough about staying out of prison. Tre finds Dough playing dominoes with Chris (now in a wheelchair) and another of his small gang, Monster. Also at the party is Brandi, Tre's girlfriend. Tre has his apprehensions about dating Brandi because she won't have sex with him. Tre also hasn't called her for several days and she leaves when a conversation about the subject goes nowhere. When the food is served, Tre suggests that the men at the party wait for the women to get their meals first. Ricky is also at the party and we see that he is now a father with an infant son. The child's mother lives with Ricky and his family at their mother's house.", "Tre heads home with a plate of food for his father. He notices a toddler playing in the street and takes her home to his drug-addicted mother, admonishing her for not watching her child and for not changing the baby's diapers. She offers him oral sex in exchange for money but Tre refuses. As he crosses the street, a red car stops abruptly in front of him. One of the back windows rolls down and an angry-looking gang member points a sawed-off, double-barreled shotgun at Tre. Tre, though frightened, stands his ground and the car peels off.", "At home, Tre gives his father the plate he brought home and asks Furious to trim his hair. While he does, Tre bemusedly tells his father that he's getting older. Furious, also amused, reminds Tre that Tre is only 17 years younger than him. Tre jokes a bit about his future children bothering their grandfather for money and Furious becomes agitated, asking Tre if he's protecting himself if he's sexually active. Tre tells his father a fictional story about having sex with a teenaged woman he met and Furious scolds him for not using a condom.", "The next morning, Tre picks up Ricky and they head to school. Tre mentions the conversation with his father and reveals he's a virgin. Ricky laughs at first but apologizes after a few moments. After school, Ricky goes to football practice and Tre talks to Brandi. She still refuses to have sex with him because she's Catholic. Tre tries several arguments but Brandi remains steadfast. However, the two reconcile.", "That night, while Doughboy hangs out on his front porch with his friends, an admissions representative from USC talks with Ricky about entering the prestigious university on a football scholarship. The rep suggests that football should not be Ricky's only goal for college, that he should explore other academic majors like business or computer sciences. All that remains for Ricky to qualify for the scholarship is to take the SAT. After the rep leaves, Brenda tells him how proud she is of him.", "A few days later, Ricky and Tre take the SAT exam. After they finish, they go to Furious' office. Furious has built his own business where he assists people in finding low-cost loans to buy houses. He has Tre drive them to a very rough neighborhood in Compton. Under a large billboard advertising \"cash for your home\" Furious tells the boys about the process of gentrification, where the property value of run-down neighborhoods is reduced with the effect of forcing out the poor residents and then raising the property value to attract new, higher-income residents. Furious speaks further on the subject, talking about how rough neighborhoods like these have more liquor and gun stores than non-black neighborhoods. As he speaks, several young hustlers of the community walk over to listen to him. Furious' theory is that stores like those sell products that encourage poor people to kill themselves, either slowly (in the case of alcohol) or quickly (from murders). He also ties in the idea that crack cocaine is very rapidly creating too many addicts and causing too many deaths in poor communities. Furious suggests that black communities should work together to keep their businesses black-owned. When an old man who wanders into the group, he suggests that it the young people are the cause of all the trouble because they don't work, drink alcohol, deal drugs, smoke crack cocaine and kill each other in the streets. Furious counters, saying that black people don't supply the drugs that find their way onto the streets. One of the young men from the street says that he has no choice when someone approaches him in anger with a gun; he'll kill him before he'll be killed himself. Furious gravely tells him to think before he shoots.", "Tre and Ricky drive back toward home when Tre says they should catch up with Doughboy & his friends on Crenshaw Boulevard. They arrive and park their car and walk back to Dough's car. While they talk to Dough, a tall gang member deliberately shoulders Rick roughly. Rick is suddenly angry and begins shouting at him -- the gang member seems indifferent. Dough gets out of his car and shows off the pistol he carries tucked in his waistband. When the gang member's girlfriend suggests they all hang out without a single shooting happening, Dough insults her. More of Dough's friends rally behind him and the hood stalks off. Moments later, a burst of automatic gunfire is heard and everyone scatters. The hood, returning to his car, had fired into the air with a MAC-10 sub-machine gun.", "As they race away, Tre is upset, talking about how he feels the need to escape LA. He's soon pulled over -- one of the cops is the same cop that had responded to his father's call years before when their house had been broken into. The cop doesn't recognize Tre himself but assumes him to be a gang member. Angry at the thought of another gang member causing trouble on his beat, the cop pulls his pistol on Tre and threatens to shoot him. When another call comes in for a possible homicide, the cop lets Tre and Ricky go.", "Tre goes to Brandi's house and breaks down crying. She comforts him and the two go to bed together. The next morning, Tre finds Dough on his mother's front porch. Ricky is inside, watching television. An ad for the US Army comes on and he begins to think that service might be the answer to his financial concerns for going to USC. His girlfriend asks him to go to a store and buy some cornmeal. On his way out the door, his brother gives him a hard time about being domesticated by his girlfriend. Ricky dismisses Dough with an insulting remark and they begin to fight on the front lawn. Their mother comes out and stops the fight by slapping Dough across the face. While Dough protests, his mother tries to comfort Ricky, who stalks off, followed by Tre.", "The two go to a nearby convenience store. Ricky talks about how he'd like to join the Army however Tre tries to talk him out of it, citing his father's service & how it wasn't of much benefit to a young black man. On their return trip from the store, they spot the car belonging to the gang banger who'd started the fight with Rick the night before. The car begins to chase them and they break for an alley, slipping into a few back yards to throw off their pursuers. At home, Dough sees the gang bangers car rip around their block and instinctively knows they're chasing Rick and Tre. He gets into his own car with some friends and roars off to find them.", "Emerging in another alley, Rick suggests he & Tre split up and meet back at home. Ricky is walking quietly toward another street, scratching a few lottery tickets he'd bought. Tre sees the gang bangers car pull up behind Rick and yells for him to run. From the backseat of the car, one of the gang members shoots Rick twice with a sawed-off shotgun. One shot hits Rick in the thigh, the other rips through his lower chest. He falls to the ground as Tre runs to him and holds him.", "Doughboy and the others arrive too late to do anything and they bring Ricky back to his house where they tend to him. Both their mother and Rick's girlfriend scream and wail over his dead body. Doughboy, Monster, and Dookie intend to avenge Ricky's death. Tre goes back to his house and takes Furious' gun, but is stopped by his father before leaving the house. Furious convinces Tre not to take the gun and seek revenge and Tre seems to relent, laying down on his bed. Brandi arrives and goes to talk to Tre but he has just jumped out his window and joins Doughboy and his friends on a revenge mission. Halfway through the trip, Tre realizes his father was correct, asks Doughboy to pull the car over, and returns home.", "Doughboy and his two friends drive around for a few more hours and finally spot Ricky's killers at a local food stand. Monster has an AK-47 and Dough rolls up on the bangers who make a break across a parking lot. Monster opens fire and hits all three of them, spilling them all to the pavement. Dough stops the car and approaches the bangers; one is dead, another who tries to crawl away is shot dead by Dough. Dough marches up on their leader, the one who started the fight with Ricky, demanding that he turn over and face him. The last banger wails that he wasn't the guy who pulled the trigger and curses Dough out until Dough shoots him twice more and runs back to his cars, his friends yelling that they need to go.", "The film ends the following morning with a conversation between Tre and Doughboy. Doughboy understands why Tre left the revenge mission and both laments the circumstances that exist in South Central and questions whether or not they are locked in an unending cycle of violence. The end titles reveal that Doughboy was murdered two weeks later, and Tre went on to college with Brandi in Atlanta (with Tre enrolling at Morehouse, and Brandi at nearby Spelman).

Faizal initially impressed with Iqlakh skills is later made aware of Iqlakh's background, but decides to play along. Iqlakh has astute knowledge of business and bags scrap auction by force. This brings lot of profit on the table for Faizal without any risk, good enough for him to neglect Definate. This is actually a strategy of Ramadhir to create rift between Faizal and Definate. Iqlakh advises Faizal to enter politics, to give political protection to all his activities. Faizal decides to contest from Ramadhir's constituency to extract his revenge. With illegal profiteering through scrap trade auctions over the Internet, corrupt government officials, election rigging and hooliganism, the town gets murkier.", "Here Definate is frustrated in jail as he is not able to reach Faizal.

Before he is found by members of the Khmer Rouge, he stumbles upon the infamous \"killing fields\" of the Pol Pot regime; endless acres of human bones and blue plastic bags (used for suffocation executions) where millions of Cambodian citizens were murdered by the new order.", "Flashing forward four years later to January 1979, Sydney Schanberg receives a journalism award for his coverage of the Cambodian conflict. At the acceptance dinner he tells the audience that half the recognition for the award belongs to Pran. In the men's room, he is confronted by Rockoff who harshly accuses him of not doing enough to locate Pran and for using his friend to win the award. Schanberg defends his efforts, saying that he has contacted every humanitarian relief agency possible in the four years since Pran's disappearance. Rockoff suggests that Schanberg subtly pressured Pran to remain in Cambodia because Pran was so vital to Sydney's work. This accusation hits close to home, and Schanberg begins to wonder whether he put his own self-interest ahead of Pran's safety. He finally admits that Pran \"stayed because I wanted him to stay.\"", "Back in Cambodia, Pran is assigned to be the assistant to the Khmer Rouge leader of a different prison compound, a man named Phat, and charged mostly with tending to his little boy. Pran continues his self-imposed discipline of behaving as an uneducated peasant who merely drove a taxi, despite several of Phat's attempts to trick him into revealing his knowledge of both French and English. One night Pran listens to a radio broadcast in English and is discovered by Phat, who surprisingly doesn't punish him but seems to find a new trust in him. Phat asks Pran to take ward of his son in the event that he is killed.", "By this time, the Khmer Rouge are now engaged in a war with Vietnam. The conflict reaches Pran's region and a battle ensues between the Khmer Rouge of the compound and the invading Vietnamese troops which are supported when two Vietnamese fighter jets are sent in to destroy the camp. After the skirmish has ended, Pran discovers that Phat's son has American money and a map leading to safety. When Phat tries to stop the younger Khmer Rouge officers from killing several of his comrades, he is ignominiously shot.", "In the confusion, Pran escapes with four other prisoners and they begin a long trek through the jungle with Phat's young son. The group later splits and three of them head in a different direction. Pran continues following the map with one of them. However, Pran's companion steps on a hidden land mine while holding the child. Though Pran pleads with the man to give him the child, the mine goes off, killing them both. Pran mourns for a time and continues on, alone.", "One day, Pran crests the escarpment of the Dângrêk Mountains and sees a Red Cross camp near the border of Thailand. The scene shifts to Schanberg at the offices of the New York Times calling Pran's family with the news that Pran is alive and safe. Soon after, Schanberg travels to the Red Cross camp in Thailand and is reunited with Pran. Asking Pran to forgive him, Pran answers, with a smile, \"Nothing to forgive, Sydney\", as the two embrace.", "John Lennon's popular song, \"Imagine\" plays over the scene and during the end credits, which show actual photos of the real Pran and Schanberg."]},

He is very idealistic and believes in non-brutal methods to catch criminals. Serpico also refuses to join in on police corruption, specifically that which involves shaking down and taking payoffs from gambling and drug dealing organizations. His refusal to take bribes earns him the suspicion of his fellow officers throughout the majority of the precincts to which he is assigned. Additionally, Serpico finds trouble fitting in due to his embrace of the counterculture of the 1960s: He moves to Greenwich Village, grows his hair and beard long to the point where he must maintain a plainclothes appearance, and associates with a more left-wing crowd that is distrusting of the NYPD.", "At first Serpico tries appealing to his bosses about the corruption, but gets nowhere.

They knew they were powered by rockets that could explode them into the tiniest of atoms. There were the fierce fires of re-entry that could reduce them to cinders, as well as the possibility of no re-entry, leaving them to perish miserably in their orbits.

The space began when ", " broke the sound barrier. It was after the Soviets successfully launched the Sputnik satellite in 1959, that the U.S. redoubled its efforts to catch up. After rigorous testing, 7 pilots were selected for the program. They instantly became the modern day equivalent of rock stars, appearing on television and having articles written about them in Life magazine. The work was serious however and dangerous, given the poor record the missile designers faced with multiple failures before finally getting a successful launch. There is a good deal of rivalry among the USA's first astronauts, some quite serious as ambitions and different values come into play.", "The post-WWII period in the US is a time of grandeur and hope, wanting to do things bigger and better than had ever been done before. Within the military, this attitude applies largely to flight, where there is a continual race not only to fly faster and higher, but do it first and especially before the Soviets. The men that are going to achieve these feats are the ones with the \"right stuff\". One of those initial targets is to break the sound barrier - Mach 1 - with pilots in the newly commissioned US Air Force at Edwards Air Force Base in California primarily those attempting the feat, many who will die in the process. But with what is happening in the Soviet Union will accelerate the American space program, which will largely usurp the political and public consciousness on those aeronautic feats. However, many within the space program and many pilots downgrade the importance of \"man behind the wheel\" in getting into space. Regardless, many pilots apply for the seven positions within the first American space program - Mercury - the seven chosen who do whatever they can to make flying expertise an important aspect of the job. In all these situations, the support from the women behind the men is demonstrated, they who have the continual fact of one in four not making it back from a flight in the front of their minds. The motivations of the individuals comprising the pilots, the astronauts and the wives are also shown.", "In 1947, a group of determined men gathered at a remote Air Force base in the high desert of California. Their goal was to break the sound barrier by using a small rocket-powered test plane called the X-1. The only problem was that others had tried before, and not all had survived. Some thought of the sound barrier as a \"demon that lived in the sky\", waiting to destroy any who dared confront it.", "Chuck Yeager (Sam Shepard), a young wartime ace with a wild reputation, volunteers to fly the X-1, and spends the night before his flight at the local bar. After a few drinks, he and his wife go galloping off on their horses through the twilight, but a tree branch catches Yeager across the chest, knocking him off the horse and cracking a few ribs. Hiding his injury from the flight crew the next morning, Yeager climbs painfully into the plane and prepares to confront the sound barrier \"demon\".", "The little X-1 is carried aloft by a large B-29 bomber, then at the right altitude, is dropped free. Yeager ignites the rocket engine and quickly zooms up into the sky, going faster and faster, closing in on the deadly Mach-1 mark. The plane begins to vibrate, then shake, with Yeager fighting the controls. Suddenly, there is a strange boom, heard by the crew waiting on the ground, and everyone fears that the sound barrier has claimed another life. A moment later, they are surprised to hear Yeager's calm voice crackle over the radio, \"Make a note here would you?\" This Mach-meter must be busted. It's jumped clear off the scale.\" Amazed, then jubilant, they realize that Yeager has done it: The sound barrier had been broken. A reporter rushes to the nearest pay phone to report the event and is stopped by an Air Force officer who tells him the nature of the mission is top secret - they don't want the news to reach the Soviet Union.", "The desert airbase, now called Edwards, quickly becomes the center for all test and experimental aircraft in the U.S., and every hot-shot jet-jockey looking for a chance to become famous gravitates there. A few years pass, and one such pilot, Gordo Cooper (Dennis Quaid) can't wait to take a crack at becoming \"the best pilot anyone ever saw.\" He finds Edwards already packed with others like himself, with Yeager still at the top of the pyramid.", "Unforeseen events halfway around the world change everything for these test pilots. The Communists launch Sputnik, history's first orbiting satellite, and suddenly everything is focused on the race for space. Looking for the first American astronauts, representatives from the newly formed NASA visit Edwards. Cooper sees a chance to stand out from the crowd and volunteers, along with his friends Gus Grissom (Fred Ward) and Deke Slayton (Scott Paulin). Other pilots, such as Alan Shepard (Scott Glenn) from the Navy, and John Glenn (Ed Harris) a Marine flyer, also answer the call.", "Tested to the limits of discomfort, pain and exhaustion, the astronaut candidates are slowly weeded out, leaving a mere seven pilots as the handpicked group that will lead America into space. Basking in their glory, they are stunned to hear that the Soviets have beaten them again, launching the first human, Yuri Gagarin, into space. Chagrined, they must now play catch-up with the Russians, and Alan Shepard is chosen to be the first American astronaut.", "Before they can launch a human into space, NASA sends a chimpanzee as a test subject. The chimp returns to Earth safely but the astronauts are dismayed that an animal went first. They are further dismayed when a series of test rockets fail to launch, either collapsing on the launch pad or explode in mid-air. The astronauts also quarrel with Wernher von Braun and the other NASA engineers about the design of the space capsule (\"space craft\") and whether or not it will have windows and a hatch with emergency bolts to escape if anything goes wrong. The scientists initially refuse to listen to the astronauts demands but relent when the men mention that funding can easily run out for space missions and that they'll spill everything to the press, who are kept waiting outside the hangar while the capsule is inspected.", "Shepard is strapped into his capsule early on the morning of the launch, he waits patiently while ground control works its way through an endless series of glitches. Shepard's flight was supposed to be a short 15-minute loft into space, and he's been waiting on the pad for hours. Feeling the call of nature, Shepard is forced to \"do it in the suit\", much to the embarrassment of ground control. However, once he's relieved himself, he demands that they get on with it and fire the rocket. \"I'm cooler than you are, so let's light this candle!\" Everyone holds their breath, and the button is pushed. Shepard's rocket ignites, and quickly climbs into the sky. Subjected to tremendous stress during the launch and then the fall back to Earth, he survives the flight and is picked up by the waiting helicopter. America has its first astronaut.", "Gus Grissom is next and his flight goes well, but during the recovery, the hatch on his capsule is unexpectedly blown off, and when the sea floods in, Grissom nearly drowns and the capsule is lost at the bottom of the Pacific. No one believes his claim that there was a fault in the system, and he's denied the hero's welcome afforded Shepard. The Russians make yet another bold move, placing a second man into orbit while the Americans struggle with short sub-orbital flights. Decisive action is needed, and John Glenn is chosen for the next American mission.", "An unreliable rocket, the Mercury Atlas, is chosen to launch Glenn into orbit, and the country watches as the risky flight progresses. Thankfully, Glenn's capsule makes it into orbit, and everyone draws a sigh of relief. Soon however, trouble develops, and there is a serious doubt that the capsule's heat shield will protect Glenn during re-entry. Without it, he'll be incinerated. Facing the fact that there's nothing he can do but try, Glenn fires his retros and begins to fall back through the atmosphere at 18,000 miles per hour. As the heat builds up around the capsule, his radio link to the ground is blanked out, and all they can do is wait. Minutes tick by as Glenn tears through the super-heated air. Amazingly, he survives, and American can finally claim they have at last matched the Russians in the space race.", "Back at Edwards, events have bypassed Chuck Yeager. No one cares about high-altitude flight or Mach-speed records now; everyone is talking about spacemen. In one more record-setting attempt, Yeager takes a specially modified F-104 Starfighter up in a dangerous, high-altitude flight. Zooming through the stratosphere once more, he pushes his plane to the limit, climbing higher and higher, pushed to a record altitude by the rocket in the tail. The sky around him grows dark as he approaches the edge of space.", "Suddenly the engine begins to stall. The air is too thin and the jet can't keep running at this height. The plane slows as alarm lights flash on the control panel. Yeager looks out at the dark sky around him, and for a moment he can see the stars twinkling just out of reach; he is almost there. But the plane lurches, and begins to fall. There's no control, no power, no way to recover. Yeager is in a deadly flat spin. Spiraling down faster and faster, Yeager struggles to get his craft under control, but as he nears the ground, he must either eject or crash. Pulling the ejection control, his seat is fired out of the doomed plane, but the small rocket in the ejection seat has ignited his flight suit, and he plummets through the clouds, trailing smoke as the flames burn up into his helmet.", "On the ground, the crash truck lumbers out over the flat desert toward the crashed plane. The recovery crew fully expects to find Yeager's smashed body in the wreckage, but something off in the distance catches their eye, and they turn toward it. As they draw closer, the shape becomes Yeager, his face badly burned, calmly and proudly walking towards them. He has survived once again.", "Intercut with Yeager's flight are scenes of the Mercury astronauts attending a huge Texas banquet thrown by Lyndon B. Johnson. The men watch a performance by fan dancer Sally Rand, and look at each other, knowing they're heroes to all Americans. Gordo Cooper remarks that he's achieved success as an astronaut having a good home, money, and a fine meal, and that he hasn't even been on a space mission yet. When asked who the greatest pilot he ever knew was, Gordo hesitates for a time, perhaps wanting to mention Chuck Yeager, and instead answers \"You're lookin' at him.\"", "As the last of the Mercury-7 astronauts prepares for his flight into space, the ground controllers hear snoring over the microphone in the capsule. Gordo Cooper is finally getting his chance to prove he has \"the right stuff\", but first they have to wake him up. Laughing, they continue the countdown, and Cooper rides the rocket into space, setting records for the longest space flight to date, and proving, if only for a short time, that he is \"the greatest pilot anyone ever saw.\" The narrator tells us that Cooper was the last astronaut to go into space alone."]},

Largest of these remote coral islands is Key Largo.", "A bus is crossing a bridge and is overtaken by a sheriff's car, which pulls the bus over. Sheriff Ben Wade (Monte Blue) speaks to the driver through the window while Deputy Clyde Sawyer (John Rodney) walks through the bus. Sheriff Wade advises the driver they are looking for a couple of Indians that broke out of jail and describes them as young bucks in fancy shirts. He asks the driver to phone his office if he sees them. After the police leave, the driver turns and tells Major Frank McCloud (Humphrey Bogart) seated behind him that the Indians must be from around here, as they always return home. \"Home being Key Largo\", says McCloud.", "The bus resumes its trip and pulls up at the Largo Hotel. A sign indicates \"Largo Hotel - James Temple, Proprietor\". McCloud departs the bus and walks into the hotel. A man (Harry Lewis) is reading the paper in the lobby, but no one else is around. Frank rings the bell at the front desk. The man reading the paper asks Frank if he wants something and Frank asks for Mr. Temple. The paper-reader tells him he isn't here, the hotel is closed, and he doesnt know when Mr. Temple will be back. Frank wanders into the adjacent bar to find a woman and several men listening to a radio. Frank asks for a beer and is told by the people at the bar, and again by the paper-reader who followed him in, that the hotel is closed in the summer, everything is closed. The woman, however, insists that the man standing behind the bar give Frank a drink, which he reluctantly does.", "Frank thanks the woman and sits down next to her, where he sees she is clearly intoxicated. She is glued to the radio and listening to a horse race, following along on a racing form. The buzzer behind the bar goes off and a man at the bar says \"that's him\", whereupon the man behind the bar pours a drink and hands it to paper-reader. The woman says she'll bring it up, but the man seated at the bar says \"when he wants you he'll send for you\". The woman engages Frank in speculation about the next race and tells the man behind the bar, who we now know as Angel (Dan Seymour), to give Frank another drink. Frank lights a cigarette as the drunk woman rambles on about her handicapping strategy. She asks Frank his name and he tells her, along with his breeding lineage. She introduces herself as Dawn. Gaye Dawn (Claire Trevor). Meanwhile, paper-reader returns from upstairs and tells Gaye \"he wants you\". She excuses herself and stumbles through the lobby, making up her face as she goes.", "The men at the bar ask who Frank is, and tell him once again that the hotel is closed and wont be open for another month. Frank asks them what they're doing here, and they say they are here by special arrangement. Frank says he is not interested in staying, he just wants to see Mr. Temple. One of the men at the bar tells him hes out at the boathouse. Frank picks up his hat and bag and heads out.", "Out on the pier behind the hotel he meets James Temple (Lionel Barrymore), who is wheelchair-bound. When Frank introduces himself, Mr. Temple yells for his daughter Nora Temple (Lauren Bacall), who is tying up a small boat at the pier. Mr. Temple introduces Nora as George's wife and Frank tells her that he and her husband were in the same outfit overseas. The three make small talk about life in the Keys and Frank tells them he knows a lot about the Keys from conversations with George. Frank tells them he is just passing through on his way to Key West, but at Mr. Temple's insistence, agrees to stay the night in George's old room.", "As Nora heads back inside, she passes Sheriff Wade and Deputy Sawyer, who have just arrived. The police ask Mr. Temple if hes seen the Osceola brothers. He tells them no, and introduces Frank as his son's Commanding Officer. Deputy Sawyer tells Mr. Temple they want to look around for the Osceola brothers, and Mr. Temple tells them they are not there and suggests he look for them in the mangroves or in the water, or wait for them to give themselves up. Deputy Sawyer insists, but Sheriff Wade tells him that Mr. Temple's word is good enough for him, and the policemen depart. Mr. Temple tells Frank that the two Indian brothers grew up with his son George and were good people who did nothing more than get drunk and stir up some trouble in Palm Grove. He says that he's sent word for them to give themselves up - \"not that I know where they are, mind you\".", "Temple and Frank head back inside, where Temple formally introduces paper-reader to Frank as Edward Bass, and the man behind the bar as Angel Garcia. Temple tells the men that Frank was his son's Commanding Officer in the Italian campaign and that George was killed in the Italian campaign.\nSuddenly there is a disturbance from upstairs, Gaye screams, and the third man from the bar is seen shoving Gaye into a room. Frank asks why he hit her and he tells Frank shes a lush and that a sock in the kisser is the only thing that will bring her out of it. Nora tells Frank his room is ready and takes him there.", "Alone with Nora, Frank asks her about the guests, and Nora tells him the one they just saw, Richard \"Curly\" Hoff (Thomas Gomez) and Gaye got there first about a week ago. The Temples told them they were closed, but were offered so much money for a week they could not turn it down. Mr. Brown and the others arrived in a big boat four days ago. Frank asks which one is Brown, and Nora tells him he's in room 11 but only comes out at night, and he must be rich because the others jump at his command. Frank thinks it's odd that they chose to set down in Key Largo in this time of year with the extreme heat. Nora says they'll be leaving in a day or two so she doesnt care.", "Nora asks Frank if he was with George when he died and Frank tells her yes, but George did not suffer and never knew what hit him. Nora leaves Frank, and Curly stops in to introduce himself and apologizes for the brusque treatment in the bar. He explains they are here on a fishing trip from Milwaukee, a trip they planned for a year, and one guy screwed up the whole trip by bringing a lush woman with him. He says the woman spoiled the whole trip. Frank mostly ignores him coming down the stairs, apparently not happy about his treatment of Gaye in the upstairs hall. Curly offers him a drink, but Frank declines. Meanwhile, Nora takes a call and finds that a hurricane is on its way. She leads Frank to Mr. Temple's room.", "Temple and Nora ask Frank about George, as all they had was a letter from the War Department. Frank tells the Temples that George was a born-hero and tells them a few stories about George's heroism in Italy. He tells them that George talked incessantly about the Temples, including telling Frank some personal stories about Nora and his father that Frank relates to them. James asks where George is buried and Frank describes it. The Temples express their gratitude to Frank, who takes his leave.", "With the storm coming, Frank and Nora head out to secure some boats, and Nora asks what brought Frank to the islands. Frank says he is thinking of maybe settling down and making a living there. As they approach the boats, Curly shows up and introduces Frank to another member of their party, Ralph Feeney (William Haade). Frank and Nora secure a boat to the pier. Nora asks where Frank learned about boats and Frank tells her his first sweetheart was a boat. Curly asks Frank what he thinks about a large boat just offshore and Frank tells him its a nice boat, but should be secured away from the reef with the storm coming. Nora watches Frank with admiration as he ties up the Temples' boat. As they finish up, an Indian family arrives in several small boats, including a very old woman (Felipa Gomez). Nora explains that the Indians often stay with them when theres a storm. The last two Indians off the boat are Tom Osceola (Jay Silverheels) and John Osceola (Rodd Redwing) the Indians the sheriff is looking for. The Osceolas tell Nora they are here to give themselves up to the police, if thats what Mr. Temple thinks is right. Nora tells them to go inside and her Dad will call up to Palm Grove.", "Nora and Frank make small talk about how she met George. Meanwhile, the wind starts to blow and it begins to storm. Nora heads inside to start preparing for the storm as the fishing party mills about in the lobby and bar. Once again Curly tries to get Frank to drink with him. Ralph is obviously concerned about the hurricane, but Curly makes light of it and mocks Ralph.", "Mr. Temple comes into the lobby escorted by the Osceola brothers. He asks if anyone has seen Sheriff Wade, as his car is outside. Mr. Temple tells the Osceolas that maybe THEY should go looking for the Sheriff instead. Ed Bass, who Curly calls \"Toots\", reads the paper and tells silly jokes from the paper. Mr. Temple asks Frank, who is securing some doors, if he has seen the police, and Curly once again tries to get everyone to have a drink. The Temples and Frank once again decline. As Nora continues to prepare, Curly tells Ralph to go put up the windows in the car, but Ralph, obviously even more concerned, says \"no way\".", "The phone rings and Curly tells no one to answer it. He answers it himself and tells the caller that Mr. Temple is not here, and neither is Nora. Mr. Temple and Nora approach and Curly tells the caller that if Sawyer shows up he'll have him call right back. Nora tries for the phone, Curly snatches it away, and when Frank moves on Curly, both Curly and Toots pull guns on him.", "The scene switches to a man in a bathtub (Edward G. Robinson), reading a paper, smoking a cigar and having a drink. He gets out of the tub as Curly enters his room and tells him that the soldier tried to get rough with them, and they had to show him their guns. The man puts on a robe as Curly tells him it was the law on the phone looking for Sawyer. We then see that Sawyer, who has apparently chosen to ignore Sheriff Wade's direction to not snoop around, is in the bather's room, bleeding from the head, and we now realize that the call was apparently Sheriff Wade looking for him.", "Mr. Temple calls for Brown, the man in the tub, and with the whole gang in the lobby, verbally accosts them and ridicules them. He asks if they are thieves here to rob him, to which Toots replies \"thats right, we're here to steal all your towels\". Brown tells them that he doesnt want any trouble for anyone and asks Temple to act sensible; he'll be gone in a couple hours. He tells Temple that they will be HIS guest for a little while.\nMeanwhile, Sawyer begins to come around and walks out of Brown's room into the lobby, to the surprise of Temple and Nora. He says \"you wont get away with this, Rocco\" and is tripped and sent sprawling by Toots. Realization dawns on Frank's face as Temple asks why they hurt Sawyer (\"because hes a cop\"), and Frank suddenly recognizes Mr. Brown as Johnny Rocco.", "Frank tells Mr. Temple that Johnny Rocco is a notorious gangster. Temple says they threw Rocco out of the country. Temple then tells Rocco he should have been exterminated not deported, and Frank intervenes on Temple's behalf and flatters Rocco for his success in everything from running numbers to booze, as he built his criminal empire. Rocco, flattered, ignores Temple. Temple, however, continues to verbally assault Rocco as Frank continues to try and shield the Temples from Rocco.", "Rocco questions Frank about his war service and Frank downplays his role and says he was no hero and that he only did what he had to do in the war. Meanwhile, Rocco and Temple trade verbal assaults. Rocco taunts Temple until he rises from his chair and collapses trying to hit him. Nora tries to attack Rocco, scratching his face, but Rocco pins her arms behind her and kisses her instead. Ralph then arrives and tells Rocco that Miami wants him on the phone. Rocco departs and Frank and Nora help Temple back to his chair.", "Ralph tells Rocco a bunch of Indians want in from the storm and Rocco tells Ralph not to let them in. Rocco takes the call, from a man named \"Ziggy\". There is a knock on the door and Ralph answers it. It's the skipper of the boat he arrived in (Alberto Morin) and Ralph lets him in, but pushes the waiting Indians back outside. Meanwhile, Rocco is just hearing about the hurricane on the phone, but tells Ziggy \"it's got to be tonight\" and he'd see him in a couple hours.", "The Skipper tells Rocco that the boat must leave now, the storm is too dangerous. Rocco threatens him with a gun and the Skipper acquiesces and tells him OK.", "Meanwhile, Sawyer is telling the group that he came back looking for the Osceola boys. He says he ran into Toots and Curly in the lobby, grew suspicious, and put in a call to Sheriff Wade, but the lines went out before the call went through, and the next thing he remembers, he awoke in Rocco's room where he was promptly knocked out again.", "Rocco re-enters and tells the gang that everything is OK in Miami, and that the folks in Miami are leaving right away. He tells Sawyer that he's surprised that he EVER woke up after the way Toots worked him over. He sits down to have Angel give him a shave as he continues to taunt Sawyer about not being able to take him down. Rocco tells him he was too much for the big city and federal cops, and no hick cop like him will take him down. Rocco tells stories of how he once controlled politicians and cops alike. He rises from his shave, sees Nora in the mirror and tells how he once knew a \"wildcat like her\" named Maggie Mooney, but he had to change her name for professional reasons and that she was now Gaye Dawn. Rocco then approaches Nora and whispers in her ear. Nora is obviously revolted, but Rocco follows her as she walks away and whispers to her again. She turns to confront him and Temple tries to rise from his chair but is restrained by Toots. Rocco spins Nora around to face him and she spits in his face.", "Frank comes and leads Rocco away as Temple taunts him further. Frank tells Rocco to come on over, he'd like to spit on him too. Rocco, his rage building, tells Curly to give him a gun, which he does. The gang tells Rocco to smack Nora, but Frank tells the gang that spanking isnt good enough for Rocco, he wants to kill her, but if he killed her he'd have to kill all the witnesses too, including the gang. But he needs the gang, so he wont kill anyone just yet. Rocco is upset that Frank sees through him. Curly commends Frank for defusing the situation.", "Meanwhile, Gaye returns and wants to know what's going on and wants to start drinking again. It appears that she's missed the past several hours as she doesnt know whats going on. She is growing agitated from not having a drink, but Angel tells her the boss said no more. She gets upset and begins to curse Rocco, but just then, he re-enters the room, having dressed. Gaye sees the scratch on his face from Nora, and suddenly realizes what she missed.", "Rocco confronts Frank and asks him if he has a million dollars. When Frank says no, Rocco asks him why not, he thought he was a wise guy, and Frank says its because he was educated in the practical things, unlike Rocco who was just the opposite. Suddenly the wind blows a window open. Rocco wonders aloud if a car can get through the storm, and Gaye tries once again for a drink.", "Rocco and Frank continue to feel each other out. Frank tells Rocco that all he wants is more, more, more and that all he wants, himself, is a world where there is no place for the Johnny Roccos. Rocco offers to give him his chance and hands Frank a gun while pulling one of his own. He tells Frank here's his chance to get his wish, but he's got to die for it, as Rocco is aiming at his belly. He taunts Frank to shoot him as Temple tells him to kill him. Rocco taunts and taunts, and Frank is egged on by Sawyer as well. Rocco tells Frank he must not want it enough, and Frank throws the gun down, saying \"one Rocco, more or less, isnt worth dying for.\"", "Temple says to give HIM the gun, and Rocco says no, he's afraid he'd use it and one old man, more or less, isnt worth dying for. Rocco insinuates that Frank is a coward and that's how he survived the war. Suddenly, Sawyer springs to his feet and grabs the gun Frank discarded and levels it at Rocco. He backs toward the door and tells Rocco he can stop him, but HE'S got to die first. He tells Toots and Angel to get out of his way and continues toward the door, holding the gun on Rocco. As Sawyer gets to the door and opens it, Rocco shoots him. Sawyer shoots back, only to find that the gun he has, the one that Rocco gave to Frank, is not loaded. Rocco shoots him again and he falls out of the doorway. Rocco tells Nora that yes, the gun wasn't loaded, but \"our hero didn't know it\". Temple says Frank knew the gun wasn't loaded, Frank said he did not, Toots said Frank was just a coward, but Gaye gets it right and says that Frank was smart, because he knew what happened to Sawyer would have happened to him and \"it's better to be a live coward than a dead hero\".", "Curly and Angel take Sawyer's body out in a boat to dump it at sea, while Ralph cleans up the mess where Sawyer fell dead. The phone rings and Rocco answers it. It's Ziggy, and Rocco is upset because Ziggy is not there yet. He says he risked his neck to come from Cuba with \"the shipment\" and he knows a dozen guys who will take it if Ziggy isnt there by ten o'clock, two hours from now. The power then goes out in the hotel and Toots herds everyone downstairs at gunpoint. Gaye makes her way to the bar and pours a drink, but Rocco tells her he told her no drinking. Angel and Curly return from disposing of Sawyer and Rocco tells them to go get the shipment.", "Rocco pours out Gaye's drink and tells the whole crew, now assembled in the bar, how she's an alcoholic and if there's one thing he can't stand its a dame that's a lush. She wasn't like that eight years ago. She tells him he hasn't changed and is still as mean as can be. Rocco says that reminds him of a song she used to sing, and humiliates her about how she could have been a star. He tells her if she sings her old song he will let her have a drink. Gaye tells the group about her days as a singer and starts singing Billie Holiday's song \"Moanin' Low\". She sings very poorly and humiliates herself even further, to the bemusement of Rocco. When she finishes, she runs to the bar for her drink, but Rocco denies her anyway. Frank then goes behind the bar, pours a scotch and gives it to Gaye who slams it down. Rocco slaps Frank three times in the face. Frank ignores Rocco and tells Gaye she's welcome.", "As Toots and Curly sit down to play gin and wait, the hurricane gets worse and the building starts shaking. Rocco asks Temple \"how bad can it get?\", and Temple tells Rocco of the hurricane of 1935 that had 200mph wind and killed 800 people. Nora apologizes, quietly, to Frank for calling him a coward and he tells her he's not a hero. But she tells him that she knows otherwise, and she knows from George's letters that Frank was really the hero that Frank told her George was.", "With the storm worsening, Rocco begins to get more and more worried and nervous. The hotel creaks and shakes and Frank smiles as he senses Rocco's fear. Rocco tells Temple he's a liar, that the story of the 1935 hurricane never happened. Temple plays on his fear and tells him how the storm was so strong it blew a train off the tracks. Frank taunts Rocco and asks him why he doesn't just show the storm his gun and threaten to shoot IT. Temple prays for a wave to kill them all. Rocco pulls his gun on Temple, but Frank intervenes as Rocco puts the gun in Frank's belly and pulls the trigger, but Rocco apparently has the unloaded gun now. The tension is broken as a tree comes crashing through a window. The scene switches to outside and we see waves crashing over the island and the Indians huddling on the hotel's porch begging to be let in.", "Back inside the hotel, some time has passed and the storm is abating. Frank tells Nora pretty soon nothing will be left but some trash on the beach. Nora asks if she'll ever see Frank again, and Temple tells Frank he'd be honored if he came down, as he considers him family. It is then that Toots comes into the lobby yelling for the boss to tell him that the boat is gone. The skipper has apparently taken off without Rocco and the gang, who are now stranded in Key Largo. Rocco says not to worry, there is another boat out there and that Frank will run it for them.", "The Osceola brothers appear at the door, yelling at Mr. Temple for denying their family shelter from the storm. Rocco had told Temple he sent them away. Temple tells Rocco they could have died out there, but Rocco does not care. He turns to Frank and tells him that he will be taking them to Cuba. Frank says he will not, and Rocco will not kill him because hes the only way off the island. Rocco then threatens him with beating and torture at the hands of Toots.", "There is a knock on the door and it is Sheriff Wade asking for Temple. Nora answers the door and lets him in. Wade, it turns out, is looking for Sawyer, and Nora tells him they havent seen him. Wade says that's funny, because Sawyer called from there a short time ago. No one in the hotel speaks up and Wade's suspicion grows. Curly suggests that Sawyer must have stopped in, called, then left and is stuck in the storm. Wade then asks if they've seen the Osceolas, who they all deny having seen, as well.", "Wade leaves the hotel and as he gets back in his car and turns on the lights, he sees Sawyer's body, which the storm has carried back ashore. He investigates and sees that Sawyer has been shot several times. As he heads back for the hotel, he speaks to Rocco, who the Sheriff thinks is \"Mr. Brown\". Rocco tells him he didn't want to rat out the Temples, but the Indians were there during the storm, had just left. He insinuates the Osceolas killed Sawyer. Sheriff Wade runs toward the pier and encounters the Indians. He finds the Osceolas, who take off running. Wade shoots both of them dead.", "Rocco comes back into the hotel and is followed, after a few minutes, by Sheriff Wade, who tells them that their Indian friends killed Sawyer. He tells Temple he will hold him accountable as an accessory to the murder. Wade then tells Temple he killed the Osceola brothers. Wade begins to take a report and questions Rocco and his gang. He also questions Frank, whose anger is beginning to visibly show.", "As Wade questions the hotel group, Ziggy and his gang finally arrive, pretending to be tourists, and Sheriff Wade takes his leave. Toots herds Frank and the Temples into another room as Rocco and Ziggy exchange pleasantries and laughs. Curly retrieves the package for Ziggy and opens it up to reveal a large pile of money. Ziggy examines it, and it's clear it is counterfeit money that Rocco has had printed for Ziggy. Satisfied with the product, Ziggy pays Rocco with a bag of (presumably) real money.", "While the transaction is going down, in the other room, Gaye and Nora implore Frank to not go with Rocco as Rocco will kill him. They urge him to make a break for it in the dark. Frank tells them that his head tells him to do that, but his heart tells him otherwise.", "The transaction concluded, Ziggy and his gang take their leave. Rocco tells Ralph to bring everything down, including the soldier's gear. He asks Frank one last time if he will take them, and tells Toots to work him over. Frank relents and says he will come along. Rocco asks Nora if she wants to come too, but she ignores him, and stares at Frank. Rocco puts on his coat and slips a gun into the pocket. Gaye asks where her things are, and Rocco tells her she isnt going back with him, gives her some money and tells her \"that ought to be enough to stay drunk for a good long time\".", "Gaye lunges for Rocco, hangs all over him, and begs him to take her with him. She promises to stop drinking and threatens to commit suicide if he leaves her. She claws at him repeatedly, but he finally pushes her away where she runs into Frank and we see she has taken the gun from Rocco's pocket. She slips it to Frank, who hides it in his hat. The gang depart and head for the Temples' boat. Nora and Gaye watch to see if Frank makes a break for it, but he does not and gets on the boat with the gang.", "Frank takes command of the boat and they depart the dock as Nora and Gaye return to the hotel. Temple has tried to phone for help, but the lines are dead. Back on the boat, Curly asks Frank how they're doing, and Frank says they're right on course. Curly goes to the rear of the boat, where Toots is seasick and hanging over the side near the stern. Ralph is there with him, and Curly tells Ralph that Rocco and Angel are below deck sleeping. Curly returns to the wheelhouse and also goes down below.", "Below deck, there is a radio on and Angel, Rocco and Curly hear a radio report looking for the missing boat. Curly asks Rocco if it was a good idea to leave Gaye behind as she might squeal and get Ziggy in trouble. Rocco says \"Well...?\" as if that were his plan all along. Curly realizes this was the plan and they laugh.", "Back above deck, Frank checks his gun and then kills the throttle to the boat. He asks Ralph to look over the stern to see if the propeller is fouled with kelp. As Ralph leans over, Frank suddenly guns the throttle and cuts the wheel hard, tossing Ralph overboard. Toots, still seasick, realizes what has happened and reaches for his gun. Frank shoots him. Hearing the gunfire, Rocco, Angel and Curly start getting out of their bunks. Toots returns fire and shoots Frank in the side, but then falls over dead. Frank runs to the stern to retrieve Toots gun, and as he does, Curly comes up from below decks to see what happened, and Frank shoots him as he comes up the stairs. Curly falls down the stairs, and Frank climbs onto the roof of the wheelhouse.", "Curly stumbles into the cabin and Rocco asks him what's the matter, but Curly falls over dead. Rocco goes for his gun and finally realizes that it is gone, and that Gaye lifted it from his pocket in her farewell scene. Rocco retrieves Curly's gun from his dead hand instead and heads for the stairs. He yells for Toots and Ralph with no answer, then for \"Soldier\". Frank is on the roof of the wheelhouse looking down through the skylight, watching the stairwell. Rocco tells Angel to go upstairs. Angel says \"no, he will kill me\", but Rocco tells him there is nothing to fear, as Toots has killed Frank. Angel tells him if that's the case, then HE should go upstairs. Rocco responds by killing Angel, leaving only him and Frank alive on the boat.", "Rocco heads for the stairs and appeals to Frank, offering him a 50/50 stake as a partner. Frank answers only with silence. Rocco then says he knows what Frank wants, the whole stake for himself. Rocco then offers him ALL of the money and throws the bag through the stairwell door. Frank still does not respond. Rocco then has another fit of rage and threatens Frank, saying he's \"not big enough to do this to Rocco\" and he will kill him. Frank still does not respond.", "Rocco then says he knows what it is - Frank doesnt trust him because hes got a gun. So he takes Angel's gun and throws it up the stairs, implying that he is now unarmed. He tells Frank he is coming out now and begins up the stairs. \"I got no gun, I'm coming out\", he says, attempting to conceal his own gun in the process.", "As soon as Rocco crosses the doorway onto the deck, Frank shoots him from above. Rocco, hit, but not mortally, raises his gun, but Frank shoots him a second time. Rocco tries one more time, but Frank fires a third shot and Rocco collapses onto the deck. Frank comes down from the roof and immediately turns the boat around to return to Florida. He ties the wheel in place to hold his course and goes below deck to radio ashore and call for help. He requests help and asks to be connected to the Largo Hotel.", "Meanwhile, back at the hotel, Sheriff Wade is there and apparently Gaye has already turned on Ziggy. Sheriff Wade tells them Ziggy and his men were caught heading into Georgia and apologizes to Temple for killing the Osceolas. Gaye tells him it wasnt his fault and that no one is safe as long as Johnny Rocco is alive.", "As Gaye leaves with Sheriff Wade, the phone rings. Nora answers it and it is Frank. He tells her what has happened. She is relieved and tells her father that he's coming back to them. She opens a window and sunshine finally streams in.

For the contract's entire duration, he is the sole employee based at their lunar station. His primary job responsibility is to harvest and periodically rocket back to Earth supplies of helium-3, the current clean and abundant fuel used on Earth. There is no direct communication link available between the lunar station and Earth, so his only direct real-time interaction is with GERTY, the intelligent computer whose function is to attend to his day to day needs. With such little human contact and all of it indirect, he feels that three years is far too long to be so isolated; he knows he is beginning to hallucinate as the end of his three years approaches. All he wants is to return to Earth to be with his wife Tess and their infant daughter Eve, who was born just prior to his leaving for this job. With two weeks to go, he gets into an accident at one of the mechanical harvesters and is rendered unconscious. Injured, he awakens back at the station in the infirmary, he assumes assisted by GERTY. GERTY tells him that a rescue team named Eliza will come to the station to clean up the aftermath of the accident. After his recuperation, he takes an unauthorized trip back to the broken harvester, where he makes an unexpected discovery. Because of his find, he begins to doubt his sanity, then his true identity, then the company and GERTY's willingness to do what is best for him. Because of his resulting beliefs, his sole mission becomes how to get back to Earth on his own.", "With only three weeks left in his three year contract, Sam Bell is getting anxious to finally return to Earth. He is the only occupant of a Moon-based manufacturing facility along with his computer and assistant, GERTY. The long period of time alone however has resulted in him talking to himself for the most part, or to his plants. Direct communication with Earth is not possible due to a long-standing communication malfunction but he does get an occasional message from his wife Tess. When he has an accident however, he wakens to find that he is not alone. He also comes to realize that his world is not what he thought it was.", "Astronaut Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell) is nearing the end of his three year contract of harvesting Helium-3, a precious energy source, from the far side of the moon. Since his only communication with earth is through the use of pre-recorded messages, and his only assistant a computer named GERTY (voiced by Kevin Spacey), isolation begins to take an alarming toll on his mind, mere weeks before he is to return home. This sets into motion a series of events which reveals the terrible truth behind his mission.", "The film begins with a commercial from Lunar Industries. In the late 21st Century, Earth has had an energy crisis. Most coal, oil and natural gas reserves are nearly gone. Our new primary source of energy is Helium-3, which is found on the moon. Lunar Industries is responsible for the mining of Helium-3 and sending it back to Earth. We are then shown Lunar Industries Sarang Mining Base on the moon. There is only one person in the crew, and his contract is for three years. We are introduced to the employee, Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell). He has grown out his hair and has grown a beard during his time on the base. He puts on a spacesuit and goes outside, where he drives a land rover over to a Helium-3 harvester. He collects the Helium-3 and then sends it back to Earth using a rocket. We see how lonely Sam is when he continually talks to himself. Sam has video messages from his bosses and family, but he can't communicate with them via live feed, due to a satellite being jammed. Sam's only companion is GERTY (voice by Kevin Spacey), an intelligent robot who controls the base and looks after Sam.", "As GERTY gives Sam a haircut, he asks him if everything's okay. He noticed that he's been acting unusual lately. Sam says that he's fine and then asks if anyone has fixed the satellite yet. GERTY informs him that its a low priority of the company. Even though he has two weeks left in his contract and will return to Earth soon, he thinks that it's fair for the satellite to be fixed for the person who will replace him. He also says that he has a headache. Afterward, he looks at an old video message sent by his wife, Tess (Dominque McElligott). She knows that he's lonely on the Moon's surface all by himself, but she's proud of what he's doing. She has their little daughter Eve say \"astronaut.\" Sam passes the time by working on a miniature model of his hometown and watering his plants in the greenhouse. Sam watches an old TV show and then turns the TV off.", "As Sam fills his glass with hot water, he hallucinates, seeing a woman in his seat. Distracted, Sam's hand gets burned by the hot water. GERTY bandages Sam's hand and asks him what happened. Sam says that he was distracted by the TV, but GERTY knows that he's lying since the TV was off when he came into the room. He says that maybe Sam is seeing things. Sam goes to sleep and dreams of being home with Tess. The next day, Sam wakes up and runs on a treadmill. He experiences some chest pains, but thinks nothing of it. GERTY makes Sam breakfast and cheers him up by reminding him that he has two weeks left. Sam is excited about going home. Sam puts on his spacesuit and uses the rover to go collect more Helium-3. On the drive though, Sam hallucinates about seeing the woman again and crashes the rover into a harvester. The atmosphere is compromised, so Sam puts on his helmet.", "Sam wakes up in the infirmary. He looks fine but is too weak to move. GERTY has been monitoring his health and he asks Sam if he remembers anything from the crash. Sam doesn't, and GERTY tells him to go back to sleep. Sometime later, Sam starts to get frustrated about being kept in the infirmary since he feels better. GERTY says that he might have suffered from brain trauma and continues to conduct tests to make sure he's all right. Later on, Sam (healthy) gets up and walks around the base. He overhears GERTY talking to Lunar Industries via live feed. GERTY, realizing that Sam is nearby, shuts down the transmission. Sam asks him what's going on. GERTY says that he has informed Lunar Industries about the crash. They will be sending a rescue team to fix the harvester and then they will send Sam back to Earth. Sam says that he can fix the harvester himself and wants to go outside. GERTY has been given orders to keep Sam inside the base until the rescue team arrives. Sam also confronts GERTY about talking live to the company, but GERTY says that Sam is seeing things.", "Sam feels like he's being treated like a child and grabs some tools. He opens a vent and cuts into a tube, causing a leak of gas to spray out. GERTY comes over and works on fixing it. Sam says that some meteorites might have caused the problem. He says that there might be a breach in the exterior shell of the base and that he should go inspect it. After some arguing, Sam tricks GERTY into letting him outside. Sam finds that his spacesuit is missing, and so he takes a spare one. He gets into another rover and drives out to the harvester where the crash occurred. The first rover is still there. Sam opens the hatch and finds a body inside. Upon further inspection, he sees that the body looks just like him but with bruises on his face. Sam brings the body back to the base. He asks GERTY what's going on and why the man looks like him. GERTY states that the man is Sam Bell.", "(To make it clear, I'll refer to the bruised man as Sam 1 and the healthy man as Sam 2)", "Sam 1 wakes up in the infirmary and we see that his hand is bandaged (making him the one we were introduced to before the crash). Sam 1 sees Sam 2 standing in the room. He asks GERTY who the other man is, but GERTY has Sam 1 go back to sleep. Later on, Sam 1 is well enough to walk around the base. There's some tension between the two Sams, with Sam 2 being the more aggressive one. Sam 1 tries talking to Sam 2, but he's more focused on working out. Sam 2 knows that they are clones of the real Sam Bell, which Sam 1 refuses to believe. Sam 1 asks GERTY if they are clones, but GERTY changes the subject. Sam 1 wants to shake Sam 2's hand since he's lonely and wants some human contact. Sam 2 snubs him, saying maybe later. Sam 1 tries to convince Sam 2 to relax by playing against each other in ping pong. Sam 1 easily beats Sam 2, causing him to lose his temper.", "Sam 1 works on his miniature model of his hometown. Sam 2 asks him how long he's been working on it. Sam 1 says that the model was already started before he found it, and so he's been adding new buildings and people. Sam 2 takes this as further proof that they are clones, since someone else started the model and they share the same memories of the hometown. He says that there must be a hidden place somewhere on the base where Lunar Industries keeps the cloned bodies. Sam 1 thinks Sam 2 is crazy. Sam 2 starts to go throughout the base, searching for a secret room. He searches everywhere except for where the model is. He asks Sam 1 to move the model so that he can look beneath it. Sam 1 refuses. Things get physical, and Sam 2 becomes uncomfortable since Sam 1 is holding a small knife. They fight for control over the knife. Sam 2 beats up Sam 1 and destroys the model. He looks underneath it but finds nothing.", "Sam 1 talks with GERTY about the other Sam. He's scared of him since he's got a short temper. He's also upset that the model is destroyed, since he spent a lot of time on it. GERTY reveals that both Sams are in fact clones. After the three year contract expires, a new Sam is awakened in the infirmary with implanted memories of Sam's family. They also have implanted memories of being on the base for a little while and being in an accident (to explain why they're in the infirmary). GERTY then conducts tests to evaluate their physical and mental states before they go to work. Sam 1 breaks down upon learning the truth. GERTY tries to comfort him, but he walks away in silence. Later on, Sam 2 tries to apologize to Sam 1, but he plays music and dances. Sam 2 realizes that GERTY was supposed to keep him from finding Sam 1. When the rescue team arrives, they will see them together and will be forced to kill them both. He also thinks that since the satellite is not being jammed from within the base, it must be caused by something outside. Sam 1 and Sam 2 get suited up and drive the rovers outside. They pass the perimeter of the base, which Sam 1 has never gone past before. They split up to look for anything unusual around. They each come to different towers that have been used to block live feed to the base. Sam 1 drops to his knees and vomits blood in his helmet. He goes back to the base and vomits more blood into the toilet. He also finds that a tooth has fallen out.", "While Sam 2 continues to search for more towers, Sam 1 goes to the main computer of the base. He tries to access his contract, but his password is denied. GERTY enters the right password and Sam 1 reviews tapes from previous clones. It seems that at the end of each contract, the clone gets increasingly sick (bad coughs, hair falling out, etc.). Eventually each clone is put into a chamber, where they are told that they will be put in a cryogenic sleep before returning to Earth. However, all the clones are shown to die once their three years are over, being frozen, and then incinerated. Sam 1 goes to the room where the cryogenic chamber is and activates it. A recorded video from Lunar Industries plays, stating that the company is successful due to hard workers like Sam and they tell the clones to think of the work they've accomplished as they go to sleep. After the message, the chamber flashes brightly, incinerating everything inside. Sam 1 finds a hidden compartment in the room and breaks it open. Sam 2 comes back to the base, having found more towers outside the perimeter and writing down their coordinates. The two Sams enter the compartment and find that numerous clones are being kept there.", "Sam 1 takes a portable video link and asks GERTY why he helped him before with the password. GERTY states that his main priority is Sam's well-being. Sam 1 suits up and goes outside again. Once he drives far past the towers, he calls his home. A teenager (Kaya Scodelario) answers and Sam 1 blocks the camera so that she can't see him. He asks if Tess Bell is there. The teen says that her mother Tess has been dead for a couple of years. Sam 1 realizes that he's talking to his daughter, Eve. He doesn't quite know what to say, and then he hears the real Sam Bell in the background (who has been alive and well on Earth). Sam 1 quickly hangs up and breaks down, wanting to go home. He goes back to the base, where Sam 2 is trying to make a shank out of wood (so that they can defend themselves against the rescue team). Sam 2 sees that Sam 1's health is deteriorating. Sam 1 says that he's freezing, and so Sam 2 helps him into bed. Sam 2 finds the video link in Sam 1's bag and replays the last call. He stops it in shock after hearing of Tess's death. Sam 2 tells GERTY that they've found the clone room, and he wants him to wake up another clone. GERTY refuses. Sam 2 makes him understand that when the rescue team gets there, they will kill him and Sam 1. Looking out for their well-being, GERTY complies with the request.", "Sam 1 wakes up and finds an unconscious clone in the infirmary. Sam 2 informs Sam 1 that he has come up with a plan. The rescue team will be there within a few hours. They will expect to find a Sam inside the crashed rover. Sam 2 will kill the new clone (aka Sam 3) and then they will put his body in the rover. Since Sam 1 did his time, Sam 2 will put him in one of the rockets and send him back to Earth. Sam 2 will then act like he doesn't know anything and pretend that he's been inside the base the entire time. Sam 1 doesn't like the idea. He knows that they can't murder Sam 3 because they dont have it in them to kill. He also knows that he will die before reaching Earth. Sam 1 makes a change in the plan, he will be put back into the rover, Sam 2 will be sent home, and Sam 3 will remain on the base. Sam 1 tells Sam 2 to travel when he gets to Earth. Sam 2 thinks about going to Mexico or Hawaii.", "Sam 2 and Sam 1 suit up and go out to the crashed rover. They talk fondly of Tess for a little while. Sam 2 carries the extremely weak Sam 1 back to the rover and places him inside. They say their goodbyes and Sam 2 closes the hatch. Sam 2 goes back to the base to find that the rescue crew will be there in minutes. He packs up some belongings and prepares to leave in the rocket when GERTY points out that the plan will not work. GERTY records everything once a clone wakes up in the infirmary. Lunar Industries can scan his memory and learn about the two clones interacting & their plan. Sam 2 will have to erase GERTY's memory. He tells GERTY that he will shut him down, and as soon as the rocket is fired he will be rebooted with a clean memory. He thanks GERTY and says goodbye before shutting him down. The rescue crew arrives, while at the same time Sam 2 rushes back to the main computer and enters a command. He then runs back to the rocket and is launched back to Earth. Sam 1 sees that Sam 2 was successful and dies inside the rover. The rescue crew finds the crashed rover and begins to work on the damaged harvester. GERTY is rebooted and tends to Sam 3, who has just woken up. We see that before Sam 2 left, the command he entered destroyed the towers outside the perimeter, allowing Sam 3 to have a live feed with Earth.", "The film ends with Sam 2 traveling towards Earth. We hear a voice-over saying that Lunar Industries stock has dropped 32% so far as a result of the (presumed cloning) controversy that was leaked to the press, that Sam 2 is going to testify at a CAA board of directors hearing in Seattle, and then a goverment radio talk show host arguing that Sam 2 is either crazy, or an illegal immigrant, but either way should not be taken seriously."]},

At the show, the man dons black leather, blond wig and performs in drag as Olivia Newton John. Harris captures it all on tape.

Tevye's superstitious wife is terrified, and she quickly agrees that Tzeitel must marry Motel, much to Tevye's secret relief.", "On the road outside of town, Tevye's middle daughter, the bookish Chava, is teased and intimidated by some Russian youths, but one of them, Fyedka (", "), protects her, dismissing the others. He offers Chava the loan of a book, and a secret relationship begins.", "The wedding day of Tzeitel and Motel arrives, and all the Jews join the ceremony (\"Sunrise, Sunset\") and the celebration (\"The Wedding Dance\"). Lazar gives a fine gift, but an argument arises with Tevye over the broken agreement. Perchik ends the tiff by breaking another tradition: he crosses the barrier between the men and women to dance with Tevye's daughter Hodel. The celebration ends abruptly when a group of Russians rides into the village to perform the \"demonstration.\" They disrupt the party, damaging the wedding gifts and wounding Perchik, who attempts to fight back, and wreaking more destruction in the village. Ever practical, Tevye advises everyone to clean up the mess.", "Months later, Perchik tells Hodel he must return to Kiev to work for the revolution. He proposes marriage, admitting that he loves her, and says that he will send for her. She agrees (\"Now I Have Everything\"). They tell Tevye that they are engaged, and he is appalled that they are flouting tradition by making their own match, especially as Perchik is leaving. When he forbids the marriage, Perchik and Hodel inform him that they do not seek his permission, only his blessing. After some soul searching, Tevye finally relents; the world is changing, and he must change with it (\"Tevye's Rebuttal\").", "Tevye explains these events to an astonished Golde. \"Love,\" he says, \"it's the new style.\" Tevye asks Golde, \"Do You Love Me?\" She admits that after 25 years of living and struggling together and raising five daughters, she does. Other events are moving apace. Yente tells Tzeitel that she saw Chava with Fyedka. News spreads quickly in Anatevka (\"The Rumor\"). Perchik has been arrested during a demonstration in Kiev and is being exiled to Siberia, and Hodel is determined to join him there. At the railway station, she explains to her father that her home is with her beloved wherever he may be, yet she will always love her family (\"Far from the Home I Love\"). Hodel then leaves on the train while Tevye watches her leave.", "Meanwhile, Tzeitel and Motel become parents when their son is born, and the latter finally buys the sewing machine for which he has long scrimped and saved.", "Weeks pass, and Chava finally gathers the courage to ask Tevye to allow her marriage to Fyedka... a young Christian. Again Tevye reaches deep into his soul, but marriage outside the Jewish faith is a line that he cannot cross. He forbids Chava ever to speak to Fyedka again. When Golde brings the news that Chava has eloped with Fyedka and they got married in a Russian Orthodox church, Tevye wonders where he went wrong (\"Chava Sequence\"). Chava returns and tries to reason with him, but he refuses to speak to her and tells the rest of the family to consider her dead. In a soliloquy, Tevye concludes that he cannot accept Chava marrying a non-Jew. He accuses her of abandoning the Jewish faith and disowns her.", "Meanwhile, rumors are spreading of the Russians forcing Jewish villagers to leave their villages. While the villagers are gathered, the Constable arrives to tell everyone that they have three days to pack up and leave the town. In shock, they reminisce about the miserable town, and how hard it will be to leave what has for so long been their home (\"Anatevka\").", "Tevye, his family and friends begin packing up to leave, heading for various parts of Europe, Palestine, and the United States.", "Yente, the Matchmaker, plans to emigrate to Jerusalem, and says goodbye to Golde with an embrace before departing. Lazar plans to emigrate to Chicago, to live with his former brother in law, whom he detests, but \"a relative is a relative\". Lazar and Tevye share one last embrace before departing.", "Tevye receives a letter from Hodel mentioning that she is working hard in a large town in Siberia while Perchik stays in the Siberian prison. It is hoped that when Perchik is released, they will join the others in the United States.", "Chava and her husband Fyedka come to Tevye's house one last time and tell the family that they are leaving for Kraków in Galicia, being unable to stay in a place that would force innocent people out. Tevye shows signs of forgiving Chava by murmuring under his breath \"And God be with you\", silently urging Tzeitel to repeat his words to Chava. Golde calls out to Chava and Fyedka, telling them where they will be living in New York City with a relative.", "Motel and Tzeitel and their child go to Poland as well but will join the rest of the family when they have saved up enough money.", "The Constable and the Russian soldiers silently watches as the mass evacuation of Anatevka takes place. The community forms their circle at a crossroad one last time before scattering in different directions.", "In the final scene, Tevye, his wife Golde, and their two youngest daughters, Shprintze and Bielke, somberly walk down the desolate snowy road with Tevye pulling the cart with all their belongings in it. As Tevye stops for a short rest, he sees the fiddler behind them in the distance playing.

He believes that by separating the two, man can become liberated. He succeeds in his experiments with chemicals to accomplish this and transforms into Hyde to commit horrendous crimes. When he discontinues use of the drug it is already too late.", "Testing his theory that in every man dwells a good and an evil force, the reserved Dr. Jekyll develops a formula that separates the two, turning him into a violent ruffian named Mr. Hyde. Thinking he has found the answer to one of life's grandest mysteries, Dr. Jekyll soon realizes he is becoming addicted to his darker self as he unleashes his violent side on earthy dance-hall girl Ivy and fights Hyde to regain control of his body.", "Henry \"Harry\" Jekyll is a well respected member of London society. In his personal life, he is pre-engaged to Muriel Carew, the daughter of a brigadier general. In his professional life, he is a medical doctor, scientist and academician. He theorizes that in each man is a good side and an evil side which can be separated into two. In doing so, the evil side can be controlled and the good side can live without worry, in combination leading to the betterment of society. In his experiments, he uses himself as the subject to test his hypothesis. His evil side, who he coins Mr. Hyde, escapes into London, and terrorizes party-girl Ivy Pierson. Jekyll, aware of Hyde's goings-on, decides to stop his experiments because of the suffering he has caused Ivy. What Jekyll is unaware of is how ingrained Hyde is in Jekyll's life.", "Dr. Henry Jekyll (pronounced \"jeekle\") (Fredric March), a kind English doctor in Victorian London, is playing the organ when his butler, Poole (Edgar Norton), reminds him that he has a 3 p.m. appointment to deliver an address to his colleagues and students. Jekyll calls Poole a necessary nuisance, then puts on his cape and top hat, and grabs his cane before stepping into a horse drawn carriage.", "Jekyll is led into a large room, with tiered seating, and a lectern at the front. Every seat is filled with men anxious to hear what he has to say. Jekyll begins by offering his view that the fog of London has clouded the minds of it's people, in that they cannot see the potential of science to free men's souls. It is the soul of men, the human psyche, that he has been obsessed with studying. He has concluded that man does not possess a single soul, but two. One is good, the other is bad, or evil, and we are all involved in an eternal struggle over which of the two will prevail. Jekyll believes that if we could eliminate the evil soul, then there would be unlimited potential for good in the world. He said he has been experimenting with how to do that, and he claims to be very close.", "As the lecture ends and the audience leaves, most of them are very skeptical and dismissive of Jekyll's claims. As for Jekyll, he goes from the lecture hall to a hospital where he checks on his indigent patients in the \"Free Ward.\" He encourages one young girl on crutches to throw down the crutches and walk. She doesn't believe she can, but when she tries, she is successful. Jekyll believes that demonstrates the power of the mind. Another patient, Mrs. Lucas, is in need of an operation, which Jekyll patiently, and with empathy, convinces her to have. He does the operation himself, resulting in his missing a previously scheduled dinner with his fiance, her father, and many invited guests.", "After completing the operation on Mrs. Lucas, Jekyll hurries over to the home of Brigadier General Sir Danvers Carew (Halliwell Hobbes), and his daughter Muriel Carew (Rose Hobart). Muriel is Jekyll's fiancé. General Carew tells Jekyll that in 40 years, he'd never been late for a dinner, and he didn't understand why Jekyll was. Jekyll just compliments the general on his reliability.", "Jekyll and Muriel escape the after dinner dancing to go outside on the patio and discuss their marriage plans. Jekyll tells her that he doesn't want to wait, that he wants to get married immediately. Muriel empathizes and tells him she'd like to get married soon too, but she can't go against her father's wishes. Jekyll tries to convince her of the depth of his love, telling her that his scientific work used to be the force that drew him to delve into the unknown in life, but now it's her eyes, and her face. They embrace and kiss until Carew's butler, Hobson (G.L. McDonnell) comes and tells Muriel that people are asking for her.", "Jekyll basically pleads with the general to approve an earlier marriage for him and Muriel, that he doesn't want to have to wait for eight months. The general tells Jekyll that he set that date because it's the same date that he married his wife, and he had to wait five years to marry her. He won't change his mind. Jekyll leaves the house with his friend, Dr. Lanyon (Holmes Herbert), furious at General Carew and referring to him as \"the old walrus.\" He then speaks to Lanyon about how there should be no boundaries to science or life.", "There's a disturbance nearby as a man is attacking a woman outside a boarding house, knocking her to the ground. Jekyll hurries over and pushes the man away, then bends over to assist the woman. She seems to be hurt, so he picks her up and asks a bystander where her room is. He then carries her up to her room and puts her on her bed. The woman, Ivy Pearson (Miriam Hopkins), works at a nearby musical hall, singing and otherwise providing entertainment to the male patrons. She is astonished that this handsome stranger should be so concerned and attentive towards her. Jekyll is obviously aware of her charms, as well, and he rests his hand on her leg (which was bruised), while suggesting that she should not wear her garters so tight.", "He is about to leave, when she complains about her ribs hurting. He checks her side and tells her she'd be fine, advising her to get into her bed. So, after telling him to turn away, she strips all of her clothes off, teasing him by flinging her garters at him, then gets into her bed. As Jekyll approaches to say goodnight, she grabs him, drawing him towards her and kissing him. He doesn't try to pull away. At that moment, Dr. Lanyon walks into the room and is shocked at what he sees. Jekyll stands up and tells Ivy that her kiss will serve to pay his fee. She implores him to come back soon.", "As they walk away, Lanyon chastises Jekyll, telling him he's disgusted by Jekyll's behavior. Jekyll doesn't seem ashamed, nor does he apologize. He simply takes advantage of the moment as another opportunity to emphasize the two competing natures of man, good and evil. Jekyll does admit to Lanyon that he longs to be \"clean\" in his life, both inside and out.", "Back home in his basement laboratory, Jekyll is smoking a pipe and sorting through various vials of chemicals on a table. Poole comes in and expresses his concern that Jekyll has not been eating or sleeping for several days. Jekyll waves off the concern and continues working. After Poole leaves, Jekyll mixes several of the chemicals together in a glass beaker, until he's satisfied that it's the right combination. He then rushes up the stairs and locks the door to the lab before returning to his task. He writes an \"if I die\" note to Muriel, explaining that he's doing what he's about to do in the name of science.", "Jekyll then drinks the concoction he'd prepared, and it almost immediately affects him. He grabs at his throat and becomes dizzy. He experiences flashbacks to recent events and conversations pertaining to his work, and his engagement to Muriel. Jekyll's physical features change dramatically, as his hair becomes bristly, his eyebrows thicken, his nostrils flare, and his teeth enlarge and protrude. He utters a maniacal laugh, as he suddenly feels powerful and free of inhibitions.", "Jekyll starts to put on a coat and hat so he can go outside, but right then Poole pounds on the lab door, wanting to know if everything is all right. He heard noises. It's Hyde who answers in a gruff voice, further worrying Poole that something may be wrong. Hyde hurriedly prepares another concoction and drinks it, reversing the effects of the first drink and returning him to his Jekyll form. He then opens the lab door and explains to Poole that what he'd heard was a friend of his, and that the man had left through the back door.", "Muriel tells Jekyll that she and her father are taking a trip to Bath for a week or so. Jekyll is upset, as he doesn't want to be away from her for any length of time. He again attempts to persuade her to marry him now, with or without her father's permission. She wants to, but she won't risk alienating her father's affections.", "Jekyll later receives a letter from Muriel advising him that she and her father will remain in Bath for an entire month. Jekyll is not happy. His man Poole suggests he go to London to take advantage of the many entertainment opportunities there for a man of his youth and desires. Jekyll refuses, believing that he must behave himself, to prove himself worthy of Muriel and her father. However, that doesn't necessarily pertain to Hyde, so Jekyll decides to partake of his concoction again. He goes about mixing it up, taking a few drops of this and a dash of that (it's not at all precise), then he drinks it. He grunts, groans, chokes, and grimaces as his body and mind undergo the tortuous transformation.", "This time, Hyde does make it outside, where it's raining and the streets are abandoned. Hyde pauses to remove his hat and turns his face up, into the falling rain, relishing the feel of it. He puts his hat back on and heads straight to Diadem Court in Soho, where Ivy lives. Ivy's landlord, Mrs. Hawkins (Tempe Pigott), does not like Hyde being there and wants him to leave. She informs Hyde that Ivy is working at the music hall, so Hyde hurries over there.", "Hyde bumps into a man at the entrance to the music hall and glares at him, daring him to take issue with the encounter. The man shies away. Hyde then makes his way inside and takes an empty table located in a little alcove above the main floor. He orders a bottle of champagne and scans the floor for Ivy. The waiter pours some champagne, and sets the bottle down, then waits, expecting a tip. Hyde tells him to get lost, and when the waiter mumbles something as he leaves, Hyde reaches out with his cane and trips him.", "Hyde spots Ivy, just as she's breaking into the song, \"Champagne Ivy Is My Name.\" Hyde sends the waiter to go invite Ivy to come over and have some wine with him. The waiter implores Ivy to go over to Hyde's table, concerned about what might happen if she refuses. So, she goes, and she's shocked by Hyde's appearance. Hyde wants her to join him in a toast to her body and beauty, so she allows him that much, but then she tries to leave. He blocks her path and tells her that a woman like her deserves nothing but the best and infers that he's in a position to give it to her. When she asks how she would get all the things he mentioned, he says, \"how do you think?\" He then tells her that he has lots of money.", "The male patron who was sitting with Ivy earlier in the evening comes to Hyde's table and demands that she return to sit with him. Hyde breaks the bottle of champagne and thrusts the broken end at the man, causing him to give up his claim on Ivy. Ivy tries to leave again, telling Hyde she is going home. He grabs her and tells her she can't go. He tells her, \"I want you and I get what I want. I love you. You come with me.\"", "Dr. Lanyon arrives at Jekyll's house to deliver a message from General Carew. The general is concerned that Jekyll is not answering Muriel's letters. Poole tells Lanyon that Jekyll isn't home and there are times when he doesn't see him for days.", "Mrs. Hawkins goes to see Ivy in room and tries to counsel her to stop seeing Mr. Hyde, that he's mean and no good and she needs him out of her life. Ivy tells Mrs. Hawkins that it's not as simple as that, that Mr. Hyde won't leave her alone. Hyde comes into the apartment at that moment and demands to know what Mrs. Hawkins is doing there. When she says she came for the rent, he tells her she'll get it when it's due. She says, \"yes, sir,\" and quickly leaves.", "Hyde demands to know what Ivy and Mrs. Hawkins were talking about. She says, \"nothing.\" Hyde fondly refers to Ivy as \"my little bird\" at first, but before long, he's referring to her as a \"trull,\" for preferring Jekyll to him. He says, \"tell me you hate me!\" She refuses. He says, \"do you love me?\" Fearing him, she says, \"yes sir.\" Hyde isn't really interested in her answers, because he knows she's terrified of him. He just takes pleasure in badgering her and forcing her to do his will.", "Hyde has learned that Muriel and her father are returning from Bath, so he tells Ivy that he has some bad news, he must go away for a few days. He asks if that pleases her and she says, \"no, sir.\" He knows it does, so he tells her that she belongs to him and she'd better not misbehave while he's gone. He says, \"you don't know when I'll be back.\" He then wants to know if she wants him to leave right away, if she would have him not even stay that one last night. She's shaking as she tells him she would like him to stay the night, just as he wants. He responds, \"yes, just as I want,\" and as he moves towards her and she falls onto the bed and starts crying. As Hyde puts his hand on Ivy's thigh, he observes that she ought not to wear her garters so tight, then he grabs her and kisses her.", "Later, Jekyll is back home, with numerous letters from Muriel sitting on the table in front of him. He realizes he needs to get control of Hyde, so he takes the key to the back door, looks at it disgustedly, and throws it across the room. He tells Poole that from now on, he'll be coming and going only through the front door. He then writes a message to Ivy and sends Poole to deliver it.", "Ivy is telling Mrs. Hawkins that she wishes Hyde would just go ahead and kill her, rather than continuing to torment her. Mrs. Hawkins wants her to go to the police, but Ivy said no one cares about a woman like her, so they wouldn't do anything.", "Ivy opens the note sent to her by Jekyll. Inside is a 50-pound note. Mrs. Hawkins encourages Ivy to go and thank Jekyll in person, and perhaps he'll also offer to help her out with regards to Mr. Hyde.", "Jekyll goes to see Muriel and tells her that he'd been ill, that his soul was sick. He tells her that he'd been playing with dangerous knowledge and he needed her to help him find his way back to his safer self. She is very willing to help him, but isn't sure what he's talking about. Jekyll also apologizes to the general, after which he and Muriel implore the general to consent to an earlier marriage, so they can be together and she can help Jekyll. The general says no. He tells Jekyll that he's too flighty and impatient. Muriel remains persistent, however, and the general finally relents and consents to the marriage to take place the next month.", "Jekyll is delirious with happiness, as he rushes home and sits down at his organ and plays a fast-paced, happy tune. His playing is short-lived, as Poole answers the door and announces that Miss Ivy Pearson was there to see him. When Ivy walks in and sees that Jekyll is the same man who tended to her that night the man was roughing her up, she is very pleasantly surprised. She returns the fifty pounds to Jekyll, telling him she cannot accept it, because it could put her at risk. She then turns away from him and reveals the whip marks across her upper back. She explains the marks were put there by a jealous and violent Mr. Hyde, and that she was so frightened of him, that she'd even tried to drown herself, but couldn't.", "Ivy begs Jekyll to help her deal with Mr. Hyde, and that if he wouldn't, or couldn't, then to at least give her some poison so she could kill herself. Jekyll feels horrible and consoles Ivy. He asked why she hadn't gone to the police. She explained how that could just make things worse. Ivy tells Jekyll that she's a \"looker\" and would do anything at all Jekyll would ask of her, if he'd just help her. Jekyll almost kisses her, but instead he just tells her that he would see to it that Hyde never bothers her again. She was skeptical and terrified, at first, but ultimately she believed he meant what he said.", "Invitations to a dinner to formally announce Jekyll's and Muriel's upcoming wedding were sent out on behalf of the general. The night of the dinner, Jekyll was on his way to the general's home, walking through a park. He pauses to watch and listen to a bird singing, and he speaks out loud to the bird, \"you are not born to die.\" As he continues to watch, a cat appears, attacking and killing the bird. That upsets Jekyll so much, he begins changing back to Hyde. He's obviously distressed as he says, \"oh, no.\"", "When the transformation is complete, Hyde says, \"but it is dead!\" and he slithers off to go see Ivy.", "Hyde quietly enters Ivy's apartment as she's having a glass of wine and feeling pretty good about things, since Jekyll was on her side now. She's horrified when she sees Hyde. Hyde tells her he knows all about her and Jekyll and shocks her by repeating things that only she and Jekyll could have known about. Hyde calls her \"my little bird\" and \"my little starling,\" as he tells her that he's her angel, that he and Jekyll are one and the same. He then puts his hands around her neck and applies pressure. She breaks away and he chases her, eventually catching her over by her bed, where he chokes her to death.", "Other residents of the boarding house hear the commotion in Ivy's room and when Hyde runs out, some men try to stop him, but he escapes. A policeman comes and Mrs. Hawkins tells him about Mr. Hyde. Hyde runs home, but since he no longer has a back door key, he hurries around front and bangs on the door for Poole. Poole opens the door, but then quickly slams it in Hyde's face, telling him that his master is not home.", "General Carew says goodbye to the last guest to leave the wedding announcement dinner, then tells Muriel that he's going to cane Jekyll the next time he sees him. He forbids Muriel to ever see or associate with Jekyll again. Muriel argues with her father, telling him she's sure that Jekyll has a good explanation for why he missed the dinner and that she wants to give him a chance to explain.", "Hyde goes to a bar and writes a note that he then hands to a male waiter, with directions to deliver it to Dr. Lanyon. The waiter delivers the note to Dr. Lanyon at his home. The note requests the doctor to go to Jekyll's laboratory and gather together six labeled vials of specified chemicals and bring them home, then wait for a courier to come get them.", "Hyde goes to Lanyon's house, telling the doctor that he was sent by Jekyll to pick up the vials. Lanyon takes Hyde into his study, where the vials on in a box, but before he turns them over, he demands that Hyde take him to see Jekyll. Hyde refuses and reaches for the box. Lanyon pulls a gun and threatens to shoot unless Hyde takes him to Jekyll. Hyde decides he'll just have to mix the drink and take it there, but he first warns Lanyon that he's about to see something transpire that he can never tell anyone about. Hyde then mixes and drinks the chemicals.", "Dr. Lanyon is aghast at what he witnesses, as Hyde transforms to Jekyll. Jekyll cowers before Lanyon, confessing that he's a murderer and pleading for Lanyon to help him. Lanyon isn't at all sympathetic to Jekyll's plight, telling him there would be no help or mercy coming his way. He tells Jekyll that he's under the power of the monster he created. Jekyll promises to fight that control, to never mix and drink the chemicals again, and finally, to give up Muriel.", "Jekyll is wracked with guilt for what Hyde has done and he prays to God for forgiveness and help. He then goes over to the general's house, where the general refuses to allow him entrance, but Muriel demands they receive Jekyll. Jekyll comes in and the general leaves the room. Jekyll tells Muriel that he's setting her free because he now is among the living damned, beyond help, that he has no soul and is perched in hell. Muriel cradles him in her lap and tries to get him to tell her what's wrong. She tells him she'll help him, no matter what it is. Jekyll kisses her, then pulls himself away and tells her it is his penance, to give her up, and he leaves.", "As he exits the house, Jekyll pauses at the patio door and witnesses Muriel with her head resting against her piano keyboard, sobbing. The scene upsets him so much that he once again transforms into Hyde and he quietly opens the patio door and approaches her. When he puts his hands on her waist and leans forward and kisses her on the back, she turns expectantly, thinking that Jekyll had returned. When she sees Hyde, she screams. Her screams bring Hobson and General Carew running and they engage in a scuffle with Hyde. The fight spills out onto the patio, where Hyde takes his cane to the general, striking him multiple times in the head, killing him. Hyde runs as the police arrive and give chase, blowing their whistles.", "Hyde gets home and into the lab, locking himself in, and quickly preparing the reverse potion so he can change back to Jekyll. Meanwhile, Dr. Lanyon is at the general's home and recognizes Jekyll's broken cane lying next to the general's body. The police head for Jekyll's house, where two of them break down the door to the lab. By then, Hyde has transformed back to Jekyll and he attempts to send them back outside and on the trail of Hyde, but Dr. Lanyon arrives and points at Jekyll and tells the police, \"that's your man.\"", "The police are obviously confused and skeptical, but as they consider what to do next, Jekyll begins transforming back to Hyde. He charges Lanyon, attempting to exact revenge on the doctor for betraying him, but the police turn him back. He then climbs some high shelves in the lab and brandishes a knife. One of the policeman draws a pistol and shoots Hyde before he can do anything with the knife. Hyde transforms back to Jekyll as he dies."]},

It and other faux pas ultimately leads to Patton being relieved and not being assigned to command again until several months after D-Day where he takes charge of the U.S. Third Army.

Patton (George C. Scott) addresses his troops on the eve of battle. His uniform is impeccable, his medals uncountable, and his ramrod demeanor unassailable. As he speaks to the men about to embark on their first great adventure, his manner runs the gamut from stern, to jovial, amused, profane and reverent. To Patton, it is obvious that war is the greatest expression of the human condition.", "North Africa, 1942: In their first encounter with Rommel's Africa Corps, the Americans are badly beaten. In the post-battle assessment, Gen. Omar Bradley (Karl Malden) decides what's needed is the best tank commander they've got. Patton answers the call and arrives amid wailing sirens and a cloud of dust. He's also early and catches most of the soldiers off guard, a mistake they quickly learn not to make again. Believing the casual attitude displayed by the troops to be the primary source of their defeat, he quickly begins to set things to rights. Patton's belief in himself is unshakable, and there's only one way to get things done-his way. Quickly establishing discipline and routine, he commands his men with an iron fist. He also has great respect for the Germans he's up against, and has studied the tactics of Rommel in the field.", "In Berlin, the Germans are also assessing Patton. His reputation is considerable, and they study his idiosyncracies looking for a clue to the man's character.

Anticipating Rommel's plan, he routs the Germans, and gives the Americans their first victory, further inflating his ego. North Africa now has two prima donnas; Patton, and the equally egotistical British commander, Field Marshal Montgomery (Michael Bates). Naturally, they come to dislike each other intensely, and as the African campaign draws to a close, plans are made for the invasion of Italy. Patton wines and dines the appropriate officals, and pitches his own plan to invade through Sicily. Montgomery has other plans, and when Monty's are adopted over his own, Patton, outraged, vows to outdo the Field Marshal at all costs.", "Sicily is invaded, and Montgomery's troops fight their way up the East coast against heavy German resistance. Patton is assigned the support role of guarding Montomery's flank, but soon adopts another plan and begins to push across the island, taking the long way around.

They do not wish to sacrifice more American casualties to Patton's ego.", "Soon, Montgomery and the British forces march into the liberated city of Messina amid the cheering populace. Flags wave and the pipers play as they march triumphantly into the town square; Monty has done it. He's driven the Germans out of Sicily and beaten Patton to the punch. Abruptly, the pipers falter, and fall silent. Monty quickly marches to the fore to investigate, and finds Patton, his tanks and troops neatly arrayed behind him, standing there silently with an insufferable smile on his lips.

During a routine inspection of wounded men in a field hospital, he encounters a shell-shocked soldier crying in a corner and becomes enraged with what he perceives as a display of cowardice. Slapping the soldier, he rages at him and orders him sent back to the front. This outburst gets Patton the first serious setback he's ever experienced. A rebuke from his commander and an order to apologize to all concerned quickly follow, a bitter pill indeed for the general. Forced to swallow his pride, he stands before the assembled troops and tersely gives his explanation, then turns on his heel and marches away.", "The war grinds on. Patton is called to England prior to D-Day, and believes he will be commanding the invasion, but finds that his big mouth and bigger ego have gotten him into too much trouble. He's become a liability to the fragile alliance Eisenhower is trying to hold together to fight the Germans, so Patton's orders are to shut up and stay out of trouble. Chafing at what may be his last chance to be in a great battle, he'll do anything to get back in the game. Arriving in France days after the invasion, he meets with General Bradley again, who puts Patton on probation and gives him a chance to redeem himself. Grateful for the opportunity, Patton quickly shows the rest of the world what he can do, chasing the Germans clear across France, and gaining more ground in less time than any other allied outfit.", "Christmas approaches, and the Germans mount a final major counter-attack at the Battle of the Bulge. Caught off guard, the American troops are trapped and surrounded, and only a miracle can save them. Patton vows to provide one. Marching his men north at breakneck speed, he amazingly arrives in time and relieves the trapped Americans, grabbing the limelight once more. Now it's on to Germany, and as the war winds down, Patton becomes despondent at the impending cessation of hostilities. All too soon, Patton's mouth gets him in trouble again as he first snubs the Russians, and then compares the defeated Nazis to other political parties in the U.S. Another uproar ensues, and Eisenhower is forced to relieve Patton once again.", "Having proved himself one of the greatest military commanders of WWII, he now faces a future and a world that no longer need him. Recalling history, he ruminates: \"For over a thousand years, Roman conquerors returning from the wars enjoyed the honor of a triumph - a tumultuous parade. The conqueror rode in a triumphal chariot, the dazed prisoners walking in chains before him. Sometimes his children, robed in white, stood with him in the chariot, or rode the trace horses. A slave stood behind the conqueror, holding a golden crown, and whispering in his ear a warning: that all glory is fleeting.\""]},

At this size, Alice scolds the terrified Queen for her rash behavior, but then starts shrinking back to her normal size all too soon. At the Queen's command of \"Off with her head!\" all the crazy inhabitants of Wonderland give chase.", "Coming back to the Doorknob, Alice is told by him that he is still locked, but that she is already on the other side. Looking through the keyhole, Alice sees herself asleep in the park. As the mob draws nearer, she calls, \"Alice, wake up!\" to her sleeping self until she gradually awakens from the dream to the sound of her sister's voice. The two of them return home for teatime; while Alice muses on her adventures in Wonderland and realizes that perhaps logic and reason exist for a purpose, her sister realizes affectionately that Alice is still young, but will grow-up in time."]},

After this, they search the train and end up in the baggage car, where they find the broken glasses of Miss Froy among items that identify the Italian as \"The Great Doppo,\" a professional magician on tour, adept at making people disappear. The magician appears and he takes the glasses from Gilbert. A struggle ensues, and the magician even draws a switchblade. But with some help from Iris, they knock the magician unconscious and put him in a trunk, and tie a rope around it.

Madame Kummer, who wasn't seen boarding the train, must have come aboard disguised as the patient, dressed in clothes like Miss Froy's, with Miss Froy becoming the bandaged patient. Dr. Hartz returns and tells them to wait in the next compartment while he orders the nun to arrange for drinks to be drugged, as one waiter is an accomplice. He takes them to the dining car, and urges them to drink the brandies he has ordered to calm their nerves. When they return to the compartment, he tells them the patient is Miss Froy and she will be taken off the train at the next station. She will be taken to a hospital, where he will perform an operation from which she will not recover. He also tells them that the drinks they have just had have been drugged. Iris and Gilbert then seem to go to sleep due to the drug.", "Dr. Hartz leaves the compartment to get ready to get off at the next station. But the drug hasn't taken full effect yet, and Gilbert and Iris have heard that they can fight this particular drug's drowsiness by a lot of physical activity. Gilbert climbs out of the window and into the compartment where the nun and Miss Froy are. The nun speaks perfect English and tells Gilbert that she was hired to play a part but is unwilling to help in a murder. They unwrap Miss Froy from her constraining bandages. At this point Madame Kummer enters, so they bandage her up in Miss Froy's place against her will. Gilbert and Miss Froy return to the next compartment and pretend to be still asleep because of the drug.", "At the following stop, Dr Hartz, the patient, and the Baroness leave the train and board a waiting ambulance. With the train still at the station, the identity of the patient is discovered. Dr Hartz arranges for a station worker to uncouple the rear cars, so when the engine starts off again, only the first class car and the dining car are pulled out and they are diverted away from the border. After the train pulls off, pleased that they will soon be over an international border, Gilbert notices that the back of the train has been uncoupled and goes back to tell the others. They agree that there is only the carriage they are in and the dining car between them and the engine but that there wouldn't be anyone there right now. Gilbert points out that it is teatime so all the English people will be there. The three of them go to the dining car. At first no one believes that the train has been uncoupled. Just as they confirm this, the train stops in a wood, and they see cars waiting, uniformed people in them. Dr. Hartz and the Baroness (she is wife to the Minister of Propaganda) are seen with the cars.", "A military officer approaches the train and politely tells the English group to get off the train so they can be escorted to safety. The nun warns Gilbert of a trap and he clobbers the officer with a chair, and he falls unconscious. Charters thinks this is very rash, and says he is going to go out to apologize and \"put things right.\" But a dining car steward has already told the officials of the attack. The Baroness gives an order and one of the soldiers shoots Charters in the hand. Gilbert takes the officer's revolver, and challenges the approaching officials. Mr. Todhunter also has a pistol. Gilbert and Caldicott (who Charters says is \"a damn good shot\") start firing, in response to attacking shots. Mr. Todhunter goes outside waiving a white handkerchief in truce and is shot by the attackers. While this is going on, Miss Froy reveals to Iris and Gilbert that she is taking a message: a tune to take to a Mr. Callender at the Foreign Office. Gilbert promises that he can memorize Miss Froy's tune quickly because of his musical training. Miss Froy leaves and is seen in the distance dropping behind a rise after a shot is fired towards her.", "When they run out of ammunition, Gilbert decides that they need to get the train started, head back to the junction, switch the points, and get across the border. He and Caldicott head to the engine while Charters will, at the right moment, jump down and switch the points. They force the engine crew to start the train and head back to the junction. Both crew are shot by the soldiers, but luckily Gilbert once \"ran a miniature engine on the Dymchurch line.\" The unconscious officer has recovered, and is holding the passengers at gunpoint, but the nun manages to sneak out to change the points. After she throws the switch, and is scooped up by Gilbert in the nick of time, she is shot in the leg by Dr. Hartz, who has pursued them in one of the cars from the woods.", "On arrival at Victoria station, London, they all go their separate ways. Sadly for Caldicott and Charters, the Test match has been abandoned due to flooding. On seeing her fiancé coming to greet her, Iris hides in a cab, pulls Gilbert in with her, and says she wants to marry Gilbert instead. They continue on to the Foreign Office. On arriving there, in the excitement of their feelings for each other, Gilbert has forgotten the tune. After a few unsuccessful attempts to refresh his memory they hear the tune being played on a piano, and walk into the next room to see Miss Froy playing it. It is the same tune the balladeer strangled at the hotel had been playing. Iris and Gilbert approach Miss Froy. She looks up to see them both, and grasps their hands joyfully."]},

He never remembers his dream for more than a few moments after waking, until the next time it occurs.

He has seen them all together like they are now in this very living room in a recurring dream, he even aware that there will be a late arrival of a dark-haired young woman, which is indeed the case. But he remembers little beyond this scant outline as the dream is always a fleeting thought after he awakens until he dreams it again. For some understanding of what is happening, Craig turns primarily to Van Straaten, who he is aware from his dream is a psychiatrist before Van Straaten divulges it himself. Because of the supernatural nature of the situation and wanting the doctor's take, Grainger, O'Hara and Cortland go on to tell stories in which they were directly involved which had a similar supernatural element of an evil and/or deathly nature, that death sometimes for they themselves. Even before Foley and Van Straaten proceed to tell similar stories of their own of which they were peripherally involved, Craig believes that danger awaits him if he stays. Van Straaten is able to convince him to face his fears for reality to play out, dream or no dream, instead of running away. Will Craig live to see the answers if they indeed are forthcoming?"]},

Not long after they land, Dutch and his team discover that they have been sent in under false pretenses. This deception turns out to be the least of their worries though, when they find themselves being methodically hunted by something not of this world.", "Assigned to locate a Central American cabinet minister and eliminate the region's scattered guerrillas, battle-hardened Major Alan \"Dutch\" Schaefer leads his hand-picked squad of elite commandos into the jungle. However, they are unaware that an unidentified interstellar spacecraft has landed near them. Now, an otherwise routine rescue mission turns into a bloodbath, as ritualistically mutilated bodies found at the scene give away only one thing: someone, or perhaps something, is hunting them for sport. When Dutch attempts to confront the extraterrestrial tracker with his combat experience, he discovers their primitive weapons are no match for the creature's state-of-the-art weaponry. Does the outgunned and outmatched squad stand a chance against the ultimate hunter, the Predator?", "Dutch and his group of commandos are assigned to rescue downed airmen from guerillas in a Central American jungle. The mission goes well but as they return they find that something is hunting them. Nearly invisible, it blends in with the forest, taking trophies from the bodies of its victims as it goes along. Occasionally seeing through its eyes, the audience sees it is an intelligent alien hunter, hunting them for sport, killing them off one at a time.", "Dutch and a team of commandos have been sent into a Central American jungle to track down some missing airmen that were kidnapped by terrorists. By the time they get to the camp, the airmen have been butchered in a very violent fashion and the commandos retaliate on the terrorists' camp. After that's over, they wait for a helicopter to pick them up, but something strange begins to happen in the woods. It isn't long before the commandos start getting killed off and Dutch and a girl from the camp, Anna, are the only people left and fighting for their lives. But what they discover is too shocking for them to imagine. What's been killing them is the Predator, an alien that hunts rare species and make his trophies out of their skulls. And human beings are the new species he has discovered.", "Dutch (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and his elite commando team arrive in a Latin American country, Valverde. They meet a general, Phillips and with a CIA agent, Dillon (Carl Weathers). Dillon tells Dutch that a high-ranking \"cabinet minister\" traveling by helicopter nearby has gone missing in the jungle, presumably shot down by a rebel guerrilla group operating in the area. Dutch's team has been charged with going over the border and into rebel territory to rescue the man.", "Dutch's team are dropped into the jungle by helicopter, and they hike toward the rebel camp. En route, they find the downed helicopter. Dutch's tracker, Billy (Sonny Landham), is able to determine that the rebels indeed took the cabinet minister away, but another group of men also passed through, likely more American soldiers. Later, Billy senses something wrong nearby and finds the bodies of three men who have been flayed and hung upside-down. In a pile of entrails, another of Dutch's men, Mac (Bill Duke), finds a set of dog tags. Dutch recognizes the name on them, Jim Hopper, a Green Beret. Dillon says he knows nothing about another team.", "The team arrives at the rebel camp without being detected. Dutch and his team destroy the camp in an all-out assault and kill all the rebels. There are no hostages, however, Dutch finds a lone, terrified girl, Anna (Elpidia Carrillo). Dutch realizes they have been set up and confronts Dillon. Dillon confirms that Dutch and his team were merely pawns to destroy the camp and its men. The team heads to the chopper pick-up point. However, they are being tracked by an unseen enemy that sees their body heat signatures.", "Anna tries to escape the group and Hawkins (Shane Black) follows. When he catches her a distorted, human-like figure rushes out of the jungle and kills Hawkins. The woman is left behind, terrified and covered in Hawkins' blood. Dutch's Spanish crew member, Pancho (Richard Chaves), asks Anna what happened; all she can say is \"the jungle came alive and took him.\" The team's largest man, Blaine (Jesse Ventura), is hit twice by laser-like blasts of energy that blow out his chest. He falls dead and his friend, Mac, rushes to him.", "Mac sees a humanoid-like distortion that flashes green eyes. Mac opens fire with Blaine's mini-gun, firing thousands of rounds into the jungle. The rest of the team rushes to the spot and also open fire. After checking the area in front of them, Pancho tells Dutch that they didn't hit anything living. A close inspection of Blaine's wounds shows no signs of shrapnel or gun powder burns. When asked what he saw, a terrified Mac is unable to identify the enemy. Only Anna finds green-glowing fluid on a large leaf.", "In another part of the jungle, the distorted humanoid sits down on a tree branch. The distortion turns out to be a high-tech camouflaging device that can bend light, creating the illusion of invisibility. The enemy has been wounded in the thigh, dripping the same sort of fluid Anna had found; it is the creature's blood.", "Dutch's team is edgy through the night, & panics at every little sound or hint of movement.\nDutch determines that their unseen enemy is not only killing them one by one but also methodically hunting them. The team constructs a trap from jungle vines which form a net and an elaborate system of tripwires. Anna talks of a legendary demon that had stalked her village in times of extremely hot weather. She says that men were found skinned and missing body parts.", "Dutch and Dillon think that the trap won't work without live bait so Dutch carefully walks out into the clearing among the tripwires. As he turns around, the trap goes off and something is tangled in the next. Laser blasts shoot from the net, hitting the trap's anchoring tree trunk, which detaches and swings into Pancho, hitting him square in the chest and severely injuring him. Dillon sees the distortion of the stalker's camouflage as it flees into the jungle. Mac instantly takes off after the creature seeking revenge over Dutch's orders for him to return. Dutch, Pancho, Billy and Anna all leave to meet the chopper, while Dillon runs after Mac.", "Dillon finds Mac a short distance away. Mac has found their enemy camped out in a tree stand. The two agree on a plan to approach it silently and kill it. While crawling through the underbrush, Mac notices a three-pointed laser pattern on his arm and is killed when he exposes his head to his enemy. Dillon finds him dead a few minutes later. Dillon is attacked by the stalker, who fires a laser blast that severs one of his arms. Dillon tries to defend himself but is impaled on a large double blade.", "Still moving toward the extraction site, the rest of the team cross a large tree trunk bridge. Billy, sensing the presence of the enemy, throws away his rifle and faces it alone, armed only with his machete. He is quickly killed. Dutch, Anna and Pancho stop, and Pancho is killed by a laser blast.", "Anna picks up a gun to shoot but Dutch kicks it away. Another laser blast hits Dutch's rifle, blowing it in half. Dutch yells for Anna to run to the helicopter and he crawls away. Dutch ends up sliding down a hill that drops him off a cliff into a river. Dutch swims to the other side and is resting on the muddy bank when his pursuer splashes down behind him. Dutch, weaponless and covered in mud, waits for his enemy to kill him. The enemy surfaces and turns out to be a large, humanoid alien possessing advanced weaponry. The adaptive camouflage device that concealed it from Dutch and his team appears to be malfunctioning due to exposure to water and the creature switches it off. It spots a target in the brush and tracks it with a three-beamed laser scope and shoots at it, a small rodent, with a shoulder-mounted cannon. The alien does not, however, see Dutch, whose body heat is insulated by the mud on his skin. The creature stalks off.", "Dutch mounts an offensive, choosing a strategic spot and sets a garroting trap with spikes. Dutch also builds a bow and several arrows with gunpowder from his spare grenades and fashions spears. He also covers himself in mud to further his advantage. Meanwhile, the creature rips the spinal column and skull from Billy's corpse, cleaning it to make a trophy. We see the skulls of several other humans among its collection.", "When he's ready, Dutch lights a large bonfire and sounds out a primitive yell, summoning the alien. The alien arrives and crawls over the unseen Dutch. Dutch fires one of his explosive arrows at the creature, permanently disabling its invisibility device. However, Dutch rapidly runs out of weapons. The alien captures him in a pond. After a brief examination of his human opponent, the creature removes its' helmet, revealing its face. It then engages Dutch hand-to-hand, a battle where the alien has the advantage of strength over Dutch. Dutch draws the creature into the spiked trap he'd set, yelling for it to come closer to kill him. The creature discovers the trap and walks around behind Dutch. As it moves in, Dutch notices it's standing directly under the trap's counterweight; Dutch kicks away the trigger and the counterweight plummets, crushing the alien.", "Dutch moves in to finish it off with a large rock but throws it away when he sees that the alien is already wounded fatally. Dutch asks, \"What the hell are you?\" and the creature repeats the phrase. It opens a panel on its' gauntlet and activates a timer, signaling Dutch to run. As he does, the creature laughs, imitating Billy. A small nuclear explosion goes off as Dutch leaps to cover.\nIn a helicopter flying nearby, General Phillips (R.G. Armstrong) and Anna see the explosion. They see Dutch in an incinerated patch of rain-forest. Dutch is recovered, looking physically exhausted."]},

However, the journey to the train station is perilous, and Wade's ruthless gang of gunmen is hot on their trail, intent on rescuing their boss. Will Evans manage to save his long-suffering family? Is Ben, the tricky manipulator, going to live to fight another day?", "A stagecoach makes its way across the scorched desert as we hear ", " sing the theme song that will be repeated in many guises throughout the film (even whistled by the villain). It's the Arizona Territory of the 1880s. The stagecoach is going from Contention City to Bisbee and is only a few miles from its destination. A group of men on horseback herd cattle to block the path of the stage. After it stops and the dust clears, we see that the men are a band of thieves, some with their guns drawn. The owner of the stage line, Mr. Butterfield (", "), is on board, and the target of the robbery is a gold shipment atop the stage. Small-time rancher Dan Evans (", ") and his two young sons, Mark (", ") and Mathew (", "), are on horseback looking for their errant cattle. Dan hears the cattle over the ridge, and they ride over to where they can see the robbery in progress. Dan waits for the dust to settle, but the robbers spot him, and their leader, Ben Wade (", "), tells him to stay where he is--he'll get his cattle back in five minutes.", "As one of the robbers passes down the gold, the driver, Bill Moons (", "), draws his own gun and grabs the man as a shield. The gang leader draws and fires off two shots--one that kills his own man to clear the line of sight and one that kills Bill Moons. Mark asks his father if he isn't going to do something, but Dan sees there's nothing he can do without getting himself shot. He recognizes the robbers as Ben Wade and his gang. Wade has words with Mr. Butterfield and instructs him to return the driver's body to Contention City where he lived. \"Where a man lives, that's where he should be buried.\" Wade then confiscates Dan's horses so he won't ride to the marshal. He says he'll turn them loose just this side of Bisbee. Taking the six horses from the stagecoach as well, Wade and his men depart. Dan and his boys go on foot to bring the cattle home, and Dan agrees to return with a horse for the stranded stage.", "At home, Dan's devoted wife Alice (", ") is shocked at her husband's lack of outrage over the crime. He explains there were twelve of them and there was nothing he could do. People have to watch a lot of terrible things: \"You just seem to expect somethin' from me that I'm not.\" Dan is defeated and distracted by the three-year drought that threatens his ranch. He has cattle dying of thirst, and he doesn't have the $200 a neighboring rancher charges for six months' water right to a stream that runs through his land--one that doesn't run dry. Alice urges Dan to borrow the money in town, and he concedes, \"I suppose I could try.\"", "At the saloon in Bisbee, Wade and his men, posing as cowhands, tell the pretty barmaid, Emmy (", "), that they just witnessed the stage being robbed and its driver killed. The marshal (", ") organizes a posse to ride out after the outlaws. Wade tells his men to scatter into the countryside, cross the border and meet that night in Nogales. His men ride out in one direction, and the posse rides out in the opposite direction, while Wade remains behind to romance Emmy.", "Dan and Butterfield see the spot along the trail where the gang buried their man. The posse rides up, and Butterfield tells them the perpetrators went into Bisbee. Dan describes them and identifies them as Ben Wade and his gang. The marshal realizes he was duped. Alex Potter (", "), the town drunk, catches up and reveals that one of the gang is still back at the saloon. Surmising it must be Wade himself, they all ride back to town to capture him.", "Dan approaches Wade in the saloon about being paid for the half a day's time he lost finding his cattle and bringing them home. Wade pays him two dollars for his time (the rate for a full day's work) and even adds two more for the boys' time: \"I used their time too, didn't I?\" Dan says it was tiring for the cattle, and Wade pays him two more for tired cattle. As Dan asks about two dollars extra \"for makin' me nervous,\" the marshal sneaks up behind Wade and arrests him. Witnessing the arrest is Wade's main henchman, Charlie Prince (", "), who doubled back to check on the boss. He rides out to notify the others. Aware that the outlaws will return to free their leader, the marshal wants to get Wade out of town quickly.", "The marshal tries to deputize Dan--\"you're the best shot we got ... every man here is a deputy\"--but Dan declines. He came into town on business, and he has dying cattle to take care of. Dan asks Mac (", "), posse member, proprietor of the saloon and small-time banker, for a $200 loan. Mac can't help him but asks about the missus and the boys. Outside, the marshal asks for two volunteers to ride ahead with Dave Keene (", "). The marshal won't reveal the exact nature and risk of the assignment, and the others are also reluctant--they don't know if it'll be safe. He answers their concern: \"Who knows what's safe? I know a man dropped dead from lookin' at his wife. My own grandmother fought the Indians for 60 years and then choked to death on lemon pie.\" Butterfield offers $200 to each man, and Dan, just arriving from the saloon, jumps at the opportunity. The marshal gives him a sawed-off, double-barreled shotgun to use. The only other taker is the inept Alex. The rest will follow with the prisoner in the coach. Dave Keene tells Dan: \"Here's the plan. We're gonna transfer him at your house. ... It'll only take a minute.\"", "Butterfield's rescued stagecoach arrives, drawn by two replacement horses. Butterfield tells the passengers they'll have to stay the night, and Bill Moons's body is removed for shipment back to Contention City on another coach that evening. Two more horses are hitched up to make a \"four-up\"--this coach has been reserved for the first leg of Wade's journey. From a hill overlooking the trail, Charlie Prince and one of his cohorts watch the coach's progress. In a staged deception, the driver runs the right rear wheel off the edge of a small bridge into a ditch. The men with the coach struggle to free it. The marshal makes a show of enlisting help from the nearby ranch house (Dan's), thereby removing Wade and replacing him with imposter Dave Keene. The outlaws on the hill apparently fall for the ruse.", "Wade is then held at Dan's ranch. Alice serves a fine supper to the family and their \"guest,\" and Dan thinks she shows a little too much interest in the prisoner's conversation--\"all big-eyed and listenin' to him.\" Dan explains the rest of the plan to her. The two outlaws who were tricked by the transfer will have to round up their men first before catching up with the coach and discovering that their leader is not on it. By then it should be at least noon of the following day, and they won't have enough time to reach Contention City before the train to Yuma comes through. Meanwhile, Dan and Alex will escort Wade to Contention City and wait there to put him on the 3:10 to Yuma--out of his gang's reach. (The territorial prison is in Yuma.)", "After supper, Dan and Alex escort Wade under cover of darkness to Contention City, where they arrive at daybreak. Butterfield meets them at the edge of town by the train station. He says the plan to stay in a house by the station has changed--the owner's afraid--and all he could arrange was a room at the hotel. There's a drunk sleeping it off under a newspaper in the hotel lobby. Alex goes to keep watch at the edge of town while Dan guards Wade in the bridal suite upstairs in the front. Dan threatens to shoot if Wade tries to escape, but when Wade tries to jump him, Dan spares his life. Butterfield reads the Contention City Weekly in the lobby, getting up to ask the desk clerk (", ")--also the hotel's bartender and proprietor--about the sleeping man: \"Sure is some sleeper.\"", "The clock strikes eleven. Wade offers Dan $400 to let him escape--double what Butterfield is paying. An approaching drumbeat is heard. Out the window, they see Moons's funeral procession pass in the street below, prompting Wade to assert that he shot the driver in self-defense. The driver drew first, he says, conveniently leaving out that it was during the armed robbery already in progress.", "The man sleeping under the newspaper in the lobby wakes up--it's Charlie Prince. He sees the time (11:07), asks if any strangers have come into town (\"not since you went to sleep, sir\"), and goes outside. Wade offers to be Dan's silent partner with money--$7,000. The funeral procession returns and breaks up outside the hotel. The men enter for drinks. Moons's brother Bob (", ") sees Butterfield and denounces him for not attending the funeral, throwing a drink in his face. Wade increases his offer to $10,000. There's a knock, and Butterfield says he's got a pot of coffee. Dan unlocks the door, and Bob barges in with his gun drawn. Butterfield explains: \"I couldn't help it. He found out and pulled a gun. He's been drinking.\" Bent on revenge, Bob threatens to kill Wade--and Dan too if he tries to stop him. Dan protects Wade, but in the ensuing scuffle Bob's gun goes off, alerting Charlie Prince in the street below (on his horse now). Dan confiscates Bob's revolver. Butterfield asks, \"What if somebody heard that shot?\" Dan sees Charlie looking up from below and backs away from the window, but Wade and Charlie see each other and exchange smiles. Charlie gallops off to get the others; Alex sees him go.", "Wade claims the same thing would have happened in Benson or Huachuca--his men are in all the places they might have taken him. \"We send one man ahead to each of those places--to wait, and watch.\" Wade wonders aloud if Bob will stay to help Dan put him on the train. He predicts that Butterfield will not, but Butterfield gives Dan his word: \"I'll walk with you every step of the way to that station.\" Alex calls up that he saw a fellow ride out fast. Butterfield says they know and tells him to go back and keep watching. Dan tells Butterfield to get the sheriff and have him get as many deputies as he can, but Bob tells them the sheriff is out of town--he took a prisoner to Tucson. Bob refuses to get involved and bails out. (Wade's got a big, tough outfit--it's not a fair fight. He has to think of his mother--she just buried one son.) Butterfield goes to look for any five men to help.", "At 2:30 Butterfield returns and says he has five men in the lobby for a total of eight. Dan says not to let them start anything unless the outlaws come into the hotel. Wade rattles Dan by rambling on about Dan's wife: \"I'd treat her a whole lot better than you do. ... I wouldn't make her work so hard. ... I bet she was a real beautiful girl before she met you.\"", "The gang rides into town at a full gallop. The five recruits are having drinks at the bar in the hotel lobby. Alex calls up from the street that they're coming and goes inside to help Butterfield and the recruits, who take cover behind the furnishings. When the riders reach the hotel, Wade asks Dan, \"When shall I tell 'em you're gonna let me go?\" Dan replies testily, \"Tell them you'll write 'em a letter every day from Yuma.\" Wade calls down from the window: \"Charlie, go buy the boys a drink. We'll be down soon.\" The outlaws spread out. Wade makes another pitch for Dan to let him go. Dan considers it for a moment: \"Are you sure that no one would ever know?\" But when Wade asks him why he's squeezing the watch--it \"ain't gonna stop time\"--Dan throws it across the room in a rage.", "The recruits counted seven riders. They didn't figure on a big shootout, and they disperse. Butterfield follows them into the street and offers them $50 each to stay, to no avail. The hotelier also retreats. Wade tells Dan again that Butterfield will walk out on him in the end: \"He's gonna leave you all alone. Now what do you figure you're gonna die for, huh? Because Butterfield lost his gold shipment? Or because some fool driver got what he deserved?\"", "Butterfield tells Alex he's going up to talk to Dan and tells him to watch from the street in front of the hotel. When Alex sees a sniper on the roof opposite, he draws his gun, but Charlie sneaks up from behind and forces him to drop it. Alex shouts, \"Dan, the roof!\" The sniper shoots twice at Dan in the hotel window but misses. Dan fires the revolver once with precision, and the sniper falls into the street below. Charlie shoots Alex in the back, and his partners drag Alex inside. Butterfield enters Dan's room (207), and Dan hears Alex cry out to him in his death throes. Dan says if there's one more shot he'll shoot Wade. Wade calls down, \"Hey Charlie, you've got one more shot; make it good.\" Charlie replies, \"Tell 'em we'll use it on the way to the station.\" Dan tells Butterfield to go see what they did to Alex. Butterfield steps out of the room and sees Alex's body hanging from the lobby chandelier. Panicked, he returns and releases Dan from his obligation.", "A thunderclap is heard as Alice drives her carriage up to the hotel. She enters, passes Alex's hanging corpse, and climbs the stairs. Dan hands off the shotgun to Butterfield and goes out to meet her. She runs to his arms and urges him not to be stubborn. She assures him she loves every minute of her life with him, even if it's a hard life. Butterfield says he'll pay the $200 anyway. Alice implores Dan not to go through with it: \"I don't want a hero; I want you.\" But Dan is committed: \"I've got to, that's all. ... If I didn't have to do it, I wouldn't. But I heard Alex scream. The town drunk gave his life because he believed that people should be able to live in decency and peace together. You think I can do less?\"", "The clock strikes three. As they go down the stairs, Dan asks Butterfield to stay behind with Alice and drive her out of town as fast as he can once they get near the cattle pens. He tells Alice not to worry: \"As soon as I get him to Yuma, I'll be right back.\" He escorts Wade out the back door, and we hear another thunderclap, then a third. Another sniper on the roof fires and misses. \"Tell him one more shot and I'll cut you in two,\" Dan reiterates. Wade calls: \"I told you you had just one more shot. Next time you better make it good.\"", "The train whistle blows--right on time. Cattle come by, and Dan uses them as cover to cross the street. The gang members mount their horses and dash to the station. The train arrives. Dan unhitches a horse and uses it as cover to walk across the last open stretch to the station. The whistle blows again and spooks the horse--they run the rest of the way. The train starts to pull out, and Dan walks Wade to the moving train under cover of the steam shooting from the side of the locomotive. The gang emerges on the other side of the billowing steam--six of them. Charlie shouts for Wade to drop down to allow him a clear shot at Dan, but Wade doesn't do it. He unexpectedly complies with Dan's order to jump into the passing baggage car, the last car before the caboose, and they make the jump together. Wade: \"Let's us get outta here.\" Dan: \"Us? How do I know you'll jump?\" Wade: \"You'll have to trust me on this one. Jump!\" The others run alongside after them, and Charlie shoots at Dan but misses. Dan shoots back twice with the revolver, hitting Charlie, who falls to the stony ground.", "Then Wade explains that he doesn't like owing anybody any favors, and Dan saved his life back at the hotel. \"It's all right,\" he says, \"I've broken out of Yuma before.\" Dan replies, \"My job's finished when I get you there.\" The train passes Alice outside of town, where she's waiting in her carriage with Butterfield standing alongside. Dan waves to her and it begins to rain. Alice and Butterfield wave back through the deluge as we hear Frankie Laine sing a third and final verse of the theme song."]},

Mick Travis (Malcolm McDowell) is one of three non-conformist boys among the returning class. They are watched and persecuted by the \"Whips\", senior boys given authority as 'prefects' over juniors. The prefects are entitled to the services of \"Scum\", who are first-year boys assigned to run errands, make tea and generally act as unpaid servants. This refers to the old tradition of \"fagging\" which still persisted in many British independent boys' schools.", "The early part of the film shows scenes in the school as the pupils return at the start of a new term. Mick Travis, the protagonist, arrives with a suitcase on his shoulder, wearing a black Derby hat, with a black scarf across his face to hide his moustache.

Kemp himself is easily manipulated by the Whips into giving them a free hand in enforcing discipline. Some of the staff are shown as suffering from various perversions. For example, the school chaplain (Geoffrey Chater), who is also the geometry master, enjoys grasping the boys and hurting them during class. At bedtime, Mr. Kemp sings a hymn as his wife (Mary MacLeod) accompanies him on the recorder; the matron (Mona Washbourne), overhearing, is driven to near orgasm. Mrs. Kemp herself enjoys walking naked through the boys' dormitory and washroom while fondling soap, towels and other objects the boys have carelessly strewn about.", "One day, having sneaked off campus and into the nearby town (an act strictly forbidden by house rules), Mick steals a motorbike from a showroom and has an affair with a local waitress.

Mick and his friends are subject to punishments, and eventually they are sentenced to corporal punishment in the form of a severe \"beating\" (i.e. a caning) by the Whips. The caning is administered by Rowntree in the gym with a long run-up. The three boys are left with bleeding buttocks.

During the cleaning, Mick and his group find a large cache of various weapons dating back to the second world war (rifles, heavy machine guns, sub-machine guns, pistols, grenades and even mortar tubes with live rounds).

At the crucial moment, Whitmore leads the indignant Mrs. Upjohn to Hackenbush's suite, but Flo is safely hidden inside the sofa under a pile of wallpaper, and Mrs. Upjohn redirects her anger to Whitmore.", "Stuffy hides the horse in a room in the sanitarium. In a further attempt to discredit Hackenbush, Whitmore has brought in Dr. Steinberg (Sig Ruman), a pointy-bearded Austrian physician, to examine Mrs. Upjohn. Steinberg declares that he has never met a healthier woman in his life, to which Hackenbush retorts, 'You don't look as though you ever met a healthy woman.\" Pressured into demonstrating how he conducts an examination, Hackenbush, aided by Tony and Stuffy, manages to postpone doing so by repeated hand washing and other diversionary tactics. The examination eventually erupts into mayhem when Stuffy sets off the fire sprinkler, and the trio escapes riding Hi Hat.", "Hackenbush, Tony, Stuffy, and Gil hide out with Hi Hat in a remote barn next to an African-American community. Judy arrives with blankets and Gil reassures her about the future. The locals are enjoying their day of rest with song and dance. The kids are fascinated by Stuffy, whom they identify as the angel Gabriel; Stuffy plays a tin whistle and leads them in a dance. A girl (Ivie Anderson) sings \"All God's Children Got Rhythm.\" Then the sheriff arrives along with Morgan to confiscate Hi Hat. Upon hearing Morgan's voice, Hi Hat bolts and clears a tall hedge with ease. Judy and Gil realize that the horse is a jumper, not a sprinter, which means he's more suited to steeplechase racing, and that Hi Hat's animosity toward Morgan can be used to advantage.", "The day of the big steeplechase has arrived, but all will be lost if Hi Hat cannot make the post time. Staking out the track, the sheriff once again wrests control of Hi Hat, but then Judy gets the horse back by staging a road accident.", "Meanwhile, Hackenbush, Tony and Stuffy come up with various and hilarious stratagems for delaying the start of the race. To Morgan's dismay, Stuffy appears at the last moment on Hi Hat, ready to race. After seeing Morgan's photo, Hi Hat easily makes the first jump, but then Stuffy loses the picture. Hackenbush comes up with an alternate plan - he finds a microphone hooked up to the public address system and gets Morgan to talk into it, thus energizing Hi Hat. The jockey of Morgan's horse has been instructed to play dirty, and does so. Eventually Hi Hat and Morgan's horse wind up falling into a big mud puddle. They recover and race to the finish, with Morgan's jockey edging out Stuffy. Judy and Gil's disappointment is palpable, but when Morgan arrives to claim the prize, the winning horse reacts negatively to him and Stuffy realizes that it is really Hi Hat - the jockeys had switched horses in the mud. The race is won, the sanitarium is saved, Judy and Gil can marry, and most amazing of all, Hackenbush proposes marriage to Mrs. Upjohn!"]},

Warren signals the driver to stop the coach while Ruth picks himself up. Warren exits the coach to find his letter, and throws snow in Daisy's face. The driver sees another man in the road. Ruth makes Warren put on handcuffs, suspecting the Major is in cahoots with Daisy or the new man.", "Chapter Two: \"Son of a Gun\"", "They are approached by Chris \"The Sheriff\" Mannix (Walton Goggins), who is also looking to hitch a ride to Red Rock. He says his horse stepped in a hole in the snow, and recognizes Ruth and Warren, but not Daisy. He claims to have been appointed the title of Sheriff of Red Rock and to be the person who is supposed to pay the bounties Ruth and Warren seek to collect. Ruth tells Warren that Mannix is the youngest son of the leader of the \"Mannix Marauders\", a group who terrorized South Carolina following the Civil War. Mannix refuses to wear handcuffs, and insists on coming aboard since Ruth will be charged with murder if he causes his death. Ruth reluctantly allows Mannix to ride with them, but uncuffs Warren and has him hold a gun on Mannix for the remainder of the ride. Ruth knows Mannix would never work with Warren since he is notoriously racist.", "On the coach, Mannix says he will buy the two men dinner and a drink at the Haberdashery. Ruth says he does not drink or break bread with rebel renegades. Mannix says, \"it sounds like you have an ax to grind against the cause,\" and Ruth says that there was no cause, just terrorizing people, especially (he points out to Warren) emancipated blacks. Domergue says she supports that kind of thing. Mannix says that Ruth is misinformed by Union newspapers.", "Mannix asks Warren if Ruth knows how famous Warren once was. Warren's answer is no. Mannix asks if Daisy knows Warren. She says she knows he had a huge bounty from when he Confederacy put a $30,000 on Warren's head, and he was openly suspected in the North of just wanting to kill white people. Warren's bounty fell to $5,000, but people would still try to collect it. Warren says he has killed several of them. Warren, a Union veteran, tells Ruth of how he burned down Wellenbeck prison camp in order to escape.", "Mannix is offended because many young southern men died there, but Warren is indignant, asking why he should apologize for killing Confederates who wanted to enslave him. Mannix says that he also killed 37 Union prisoners of war. Warren says indifferently that \"people die in war.\" Mannix says \"War is hell\" is hard to argue with, but that the Union also investigated him following the war. Mannix claims that Warren was ultimately forgiven because of his service in the cavalry during wars against indigenous people.", "Ruth says that Mannix has no right to talk, given the atrocities that his father inflicted on black people. Mannix says not to talk about his father, who was fighting for the dignity in defeat that southern white men, as the \"brothers\" of those in the North, deserved. Warren asks how many black towns Mannix raided in this struggle for dignity. Mannix says many, and that when black people are scared, white people are safe. Warren immediately points the gun straight at Mannix's temple and says that if he speaks so hatefully, Warren will kill him immediately. Mannix is very scared, says he only starting talking \"politics\" by mistake, and goes to sleep.", "Chapter Three: \"Minnie's Haberdashery\"", "The group finally arrive at Minnie's Haberdashery with the blizzard bearing down fast, and they find it in the hands of Bob \"The Mexican\" (Demian Bichir), who explains that the owner, Minnie Mink (Dana Gourrier), is visiting family for a week and has entrusted the passover to him; Warren is suspicious of Bob's explanation. Ruth and Daisy go inside and meet the others staying at the haberdashery. The lock on the door is broken and the door needs to be secured shut with nails and boards. Oswaldo \"The Little Man\" Mobray (Tim Roth), introduces himself as the hangman of Red Rock and speaks with an English accent. He asks to see the warrant Ruth is carrying for Daisy. Meanwhile, in the blinding wind outside, Warren, Mannix, O.B. and Bob put the horses in a nearby stable. Mannix and O.B. further set up ropes and iron stakes to find the outhouse and stable in the snow, and Warren stays behind to help Bob with the remaining stablework. Warren asks Bob again where Minnie is, and says it doesn't sound like her to have left Joe \"The Cow Puncher\" Gage (Michael Madsen), a quiet cowboy and Sanford \"The Confederate\" Smithers (Bruce Dern), an aging former Confederate General. Ruth, suspicious that they may be trying to ambush him and release Daisy, announces his intent to deliver Daisy to Red Rock alive and forcefully disarms all but Warren of their pistols.", "Over a dinner of hot stew, Mannix teases Warren over his letter from Abraham Lincoln, saying that there is no chance Warren was friends with Abraham Lincoln. Ruth says that he is surely telling the truth, but Warren reveals that it is a lie. Mannix and Daisy laugh. Ruth spitefully throws stew in Daisy's face. Ruth is angered and loses trust in Warren, saying that it must be true what people say: that you can't trust black people. Warren asks Ruth if he hurt his feelings and Ruth says yes. Warren rebuts by saying that Ruth cannot understand what it is like to be a black man faced with America. Warren says that black people are safe when white people are disarmed, and the letter disarms white people (sets them more at ease). Ruth says it is still a dirty trick to him. Warren points out that it got him a seat on Ruth's stagecoach.", "Mannix says the letter wouldn't have worked on him. Daisy says she spat on it, and Mannix congratulates her for it. Warren brings Sanford food and asks to join him. Sanford says yes and Warren places a gun on a side table next to Sanford. Warren reveals to Sanford that he murdered Chester Smithers, Sanford's son, in retaliation for the latter trying to kill him (most likely for the bounty). Warren taunts Sanford with the humiliating details of his son's death, claiming he was forced to march naked in the snow for over two hours and perform fellatio on Warren before being killed. In a fit of rage, Sanford reaches for the gun to shoot Warren, but Warren swiftly draws his other gun and shoots Sanford dead, much to Mannix's dismay.", "Chapter Four: \"Domergue's Got a Secret\"", "Daisy asks to play the guitar and Ruth says yes. A narrator then reveals that while everybody was distracted by Sanford's death, an unseen character slipped poison into the brewing coffee, which only Daisy witnessed. Ruth and O.B. drink the coffee, and Daisy smiles knowingly. She sings a beautiful song on the guitar, which she plays well. Ruth asks to hear another verse as he drinks coffee, and Daisy sings a verse that end with the line \"You'll be dead behind me John as I go to Mexico.\" Ruth becomes furious, takes the guitar and smashes it before handcuffing Daisy to himself once again.", "Mannix pours himself a cup of coffee. Suddenly Ruth violently vomits blood on the table, just as Mannix is about to take a sip. O.B. also vomits blood, and collapses onto all fours, repeatedly vomiting up more blood. Ruth throws the coffee cup away, and Mannix realizes it was the coffee and throws his cup away too. As Daisy mocks a dying Ruth, the latter tries to kill her, only for her to seize his pistol and shoot him dead.", "With Ruth and O.B. dead, Warren lines up the rest of the lodgers at gunpoint and throws the key to Ruth's handcuffs in stove, ensuring that Daisy cannot escape. Warren determines that Mannix could not have poisoned the coffee since he was about to drink it himself, so he gives Mannix a spare gun. He goes on to explain that the stew they ate was made by Minnie that morning, so something must have happened to her. Bob asks Warren if he is really accusing him of murder.", "Warren then explains that Bob's story about Minnie entrusting the place to him cannot be true, since she hated Mexicans. He also finds a dried bloodstain on one of the armchairs, and hypothesizes that Bob murdered Minnie; he knows, however, that Bob cannot be the person who poisoned the coffee since he was playing the piano at the time. He shoots and kills Bob because he knows he was involved in killing Minnie, only to be shot in the groin from underneath the floorboards by a shadowy gunman. Mobray then draws a gun and shoots Mannix, hitting him the thigh, before the latter shoots him back, hitting Mobray in the abdomen.", "Chapter Five: \"The Four Passengers", "Earlier that morning....", "A stagecoach arrives at Minnie's Haberdashery containing the four passengers: Bob, Mobray, Gage, and Jody (Channing Tatum). They are driven by the cheerful and cheeky Six Horse Judy (Zoe Bell), who hails from New Zealand. They are met by Charlie (Keith Jefferson) outside Minnie's. Charlie, a black man, stays outside and helps the carriage driver with his horses before he travels on. Judy leads the passengers inside and introduces them to Minnie Mink. Minnie is shown to be a cheery, black woman perhaps in her thirties, and is there with a black woman, Gemma (Belinda Owino) cooking. Two older white men, Sweet Dave (Gene Jones) and the previously seen Sanford, are playing chess by the hearth.", "The crew makes small talk for a few minutes before violently massacring everybody in the lodge, leaving only General Sanford alive. Charlie comes in from outside just in time to see the massacre, and is shot by Bob in the doorway (one of the shots destroys the door's latch) before fleeing outside. Mobray asks in Spanish if they should perhaps keep Sanford alive to create the illusion of a more lively setting. They agree to try it, and Jody talks to the old man while his crew starts cleaning up the mess the massacre left. Gage goes to kill Charlie, whom he finds hiding in a shed and shoots in the throat with a shotgun as he begs for his life.", "Jody explains to Sanford that they are preparing to ambush Ruth to rescue Jody's sister, Daisy, and that they will not kill him if he agrees to keep quiet about their plan. Sanford agrees, and the bandits all prepare for Ruth to arrive: throwing the bodies down the well, hiding guns around the lodge, cleaning up the jelly beans that had spilled. Jody hides in the basement (implying that he was the one who later shot Warren in the crotch from under the floorboards).", "Chapter Six: \"Black Man, White Hell\"", "We cut back to the present as, Warren, in agonizing pain, is confined to a bed while he and a wounded Mannix hold guns on the surviving lodgers - Domergue, Gage, and a mortally wounded Mobray. Warren tells Mannix his genitals are destroyed, and he thinks he will bleed to death. They flush Jody out of the basement by threatening to kill Domergue. Warren shoots Jody through the head, killing him. Domergue becomes hysterical, berating Mannix for working with a black man. She then attempts to strike a deal with Mannix, explaining that her brother was the leader of a notorious gang and that 15 of his men are waiting in Red Rock. Domergue further claims that these men will hunt down Mannix if he kills her, however she will call them off if he kills Warren instead. Mannix tells Warren Domergue has \"nothing to sell,\" but to humor him as he listens to Domergue's offer. They count up the bounties that Mannix could collect: Bob, revealed to be \"Marco the Mexican\" with a bounty of $12,000, and Mobray, really Pete Hicox, with a bounty of $15,000, and Gage, really Grouch Douglas, has a bounty worth $10,000.", "Domergue explains that they cannot collect the bounties if they kill her since the gang waiting in Red Rock will kill them. She also says the gang will sack the town and kill all the residents. If Mannix as sheriff wants to protect the town, he should spare her life. Warren shoots Domergue in the foot. Hicox tries to convince Mannix again that they can forgive him what he has done if he kills Warren. Warren shoots Hicox in the leg. The scene is then interrupted when Gage reaches for a pistol that he had previously hidden underneath a table. Mannix and Warren shoot him dead.", "Warren tries to shoot Domergue, but his gun is out of bullets. Warren begs Mannix for his pistol, Mannix smiles and sits down. He asks Domergue about the offer: he kills Warren, they wait two days, and then he gets the bounties for Oswaldo and Gage. Domergue ascents. Mannix asks about Jody's bounty, since he is worth $50,000. Warren asks Mannix if he is about to make a deal, and Mannix says they're just talking. Domergue says he is being greedy and that she must take that body, since Jody has children. So Mannix goes over the terms again before looking back at Warren. He turns back to Domergue and says \"no deal\".", "Domergue says he is making a big mistake, and that the gang will come and kill him. Mannix says that in order for him to be afraid, he would have to believe that those 15 men existed, which he doesn't. Warren laughs. Mannix says Douglas poisoned the coffee and points out that Domergue didn't say anything as he was about to drink the coffee, too- showing that she didn't care about his life. He says she is a liar and is surely just saying what she needs to in order to escape being hanged. He says he suspects that what remains of Jody's gang is lying dead on the floor.", "Domergue replies that Jody leads an army of men, but Mannix interrupts her and says that his father led an army, a renegade army fighting for a lost cause- 400 men who followed because of their respect for his command. Warren nods appreciatively, then Mannix says he doesn't feel so good and collapses on the floor, fainting due to his leg wound.", "Daisy cuts Ruth's handcuffed arm off with a machete, freeing herself, before reaching for the gun Douglas dropped on the floor. Mannix suddenly wakes up (or reveals himself to have been playing possum) and shoots Daisy, wounding her. As he prepares to shoot her again, Warren convinces him to spare her so that they can hang her, just as Ruth wanted to. Since Ruth saved their lives from the storm, they can act out his last wish: to see Domergue hanged.", "Domergue is hanged from the rafters of the lodge. Mannix pronounces it as his first and final act as sheriff of Red Rock. Mannix is left lying on top of Warren, but then he drops down off the bed and onto the floor. The two men delight in seeing Domergue slowly strangle to death in accordance with Ruth's final wishes and the law.", "Mannix asks Warren if he can read his letter. Mannix takes the letter in his bloody hands and reads it aloud. In it \"Abraham Lincoln\" praises Warren for his service and expresses the belief that racial progress is being made slowly in America. Mannix remarks on the final line of the letter, \"Ol' Mary Todd is calling so I guess it's time for bed,\" that it was a nice touch, and Warren thanks him. Mannix crumples the letter up and throws it away, and the movie ends with Mannix and Warren waiting to die."]},

The Warriors slowly cross the dangerous Bronx and Manhattan territories, narrowly escaping police and other gangs every step of the way.", "In a near future, Cyrus is a respected leader that intends to unite the gangs in New York. Cyrus invites the most relevant gangs for a meeting at the Central Park, a neutral turf in a moment of truce. He explains that if the gangs unite, they would be 60,000 members against 20,000 policemen and they could rule New York. Out of the blue, the punk Luther shots Cyrus and blames The Warriors, a gang from Coney Island. There is a riot in the Central Park and the police arrive and put the group under siege.

The long journey back home of The Warriors begins.", "Cyrus, the messianic leader of the Grammercy Riffs, calls for a truce among all the gangs in New York City and asks them all to meet. During the meeting Cyrus proposes that all the gangs unite to form one super gang so that they can take over the city. Unfortunately, as he is addressing the various gangs, he is shot by Luther, the homicidal leader of a gang known as the Rogues. Luther then accuses Cleon, the leader of the Warriors, as the assassin and he is killed by the other gangs.

They will be attending an event called by a man named Cyrus, described as \"the one and only.\" Throughout the city, other gang delegations are seen entering the subway in their full colors. As the Warriors speculate about the event during their subway ride, we learn that Cyrus, called \"The One and Only\", leader of the largest gang in the city, the Gramercy Riffs, has called a truce of all the gangs in New York. He wants an unarmed delegation of nine from each gang to come to a mass meeting to hear what he has to say. Some of the Warriors are excited at the prospect, while others are skeptical.", "At Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx, the meeting is well-attended with over 100 gangs represented. The charismatic Cyrus (Roger Hill) takes the stage and delivers a spellbinding speech. He says that, instead of fighting each other over turf, they could unite to form an army of 60,000 soldiers, compared to only 20,000 police in the whole city. He punctuates his points with \"Can you dig it?\" to the crowd's wild response. Outside the meeting area, the police are seen silently moving in.", "Most of the crowd is enthralled with Cyrus' vision, but one member has his own agenda. Luther (David Patrick Kelley), the psychotic leader of a gang called the Rogues, has snuck a gun into the gathering. At a high point in the speech, Luther fires at Cyrus, killing him instantly. When Cyrus falls back, there is a brief stunned silence, followed by pandemonium. The crowd was so fixated on Cyrus that hardly anyone saw who fired the shot, but Luther turns to see that Fox (Thomas G. Waites) of the Warriors witnessed the assassination, so he points the gun to kill Fox. Just at that moment the police spotlights come on, blinding Luther.", "Cleon walks towards the middle of the chaos, to see whether Cyrus survived. Luther begins screaming to the crowd, \"That's him! The guy who shot Cyrus!\" Another member of the Rogues also claims to have seen Cleon shoot Cyrus. Cleon denies it, but Luther continues to scream \"The Warriors did it! The Warriors did it!\" and charges at Cleon. Cleon holds his own in a fight against the Rogues, but then the Gramercy Riffs, martial arts experts, step in and bring Cleon down with kicks and elbow hits. Cleon presumably has been killed.", "The other Warriors break through a wooden fence to make their escape, winding up in a cemetery as the rest of the police rush into the park and the various gangs flee. They take a head count and determine that everyone is there except for Cleon. Swan (Michael Beck), who as war chief is the second-ranked member after Cleon, states they are going to the subway, to catch a train back to Coney Island. A member named Ajax (James Remar) gives Swan some trouble when he asks: \"Who made you leader?\" Swan advises him to make his move, but the remaining members intervene, telling Ajax to calm down and urging everyone to stick together. Ajax backs down for now, and they make their way toward the subway, worrying whether the truce is still on. If it isn't, they will have to \"bop\" (fight their way) across other gangs' territories, vulnerable because they are wearing their colors and are not \"packed\" (armed).", "Meanwhile, the Gramercy Riffs' new leader, Masai (Edward Sewer), addresses the Riffs at their underground hideout. He wants the Warriors, alive if possible. The Riffs inform a local DJ (Lynne Thigpen), and she puts the word out on the radio, urging all local gangs to be on the lookout and capture or kill the Warriors, \"the gang that broke the truce\", for the Riffs. She dedicates the song \"Nowhere to Run\" to the Warriors. As the song plays, gangs throughout the city are getting ready to hunt down Cyrus' assassins.", "The Warriors wait for a train outside an elevated train station, so that they will not be ambushed on a open platform. Ajax complains that they are acting like \"wimps,\" but the others' caution is justified, since a school bus filled with a tough-looking skinhead gang known as the Turnbull ACs begins patrolling the area. When the train arrives, the Warriors make a break for it and barely make the train ahead of the gang. Masai is informed of the Turnbulls' failure. Meanwhile, Luther gets a telephone update from an informant and learns that the Riffs have put the word out on the street that they want the Warriors alive. The Rogues don't want the Warriors taken alive, for fear of the stories they might tell. Luther tells his crew that they can do some looking too.", "The celebrating Warriors' journey home is cut short when a fire on the tracks delays the train. They have no choice but to make their way to the next station on foot. That route takes them directly through the Bronx territory of a small, low-level gang known as the Orphans, who did not attend the gathering at Van Cortlandt Park and apparently don't know of the contract out on the Warriors. After determining the Orphans' numbers to be at least 30 versus their eight, Swan decides a diplomatic solution would be best. He brings Fox with him to meet with the Orphans' leader (Paul Greco). After a bit of tough posturing, the leader accepts the explanation of the subway fire, buttered up a bit by Fox's respectful comments, and tells them they can move through the territory if they come in peace. However, his girlfriend Mercy (Deborah Van Valkenburgh) begins taunting him with chicken noises and cutting comments. The leader's manhood is now insulted, so he orders the Warriors to remove their gang colors if they want to proceed through their territory. Swan refuses in no uncertain terms, and the Orphans leave while the Warriors march on.", "The curious Mercy tails the Warriors, and gets caught by Ajax. She claims to want some real action. Just then, the Orphans show up again, packed and ready to rumble. They throw some tough words around, but Snow (Brian Tyler) produces a Molotov cocktail, which Swan throws at a car near the Orphans. The Warriors take off past the flaming vehicle. The car explodes, the Orphans fail to pursue, and the Warriors hightail it to the next station with Mercy. She seems determined to stick around for the ride.", "The DJ passes on the news of the Orphans' defeat. Luther gets another update that the Warriors are making their way through and that the cops are out to get every gang in the city. When asked why he seems so happy about this situation, Luther responds \"I'm having a good time!\"", "The train at the 96th street station is not moving and the frustration of the Warriors, especially Vermin (Terry Michos), is obvious. A police officer walks by the car, and they take off running. During this escape they split into three separate groups. Fox and Mercy run down the platform. A cop comes from behind one of the pillars, and tackles Fox. Fox yells at Mercy to run away, and in the struggle the cop tosses Fox onto the tracks, where he is killed by an oncoming train. Mercy is running in the other direction and doesn't see Fox's death.", "Vermin, Cochise (David Harris), and Rembrandt (Marcelino Sanchez) manage to evade the police and board a subway train to Union Square, the agreed upon meeting place if they are split up. Ajax, Swan, Snow, and Cowboy (Tom Mckitterick) also outrun the police and exit the station at the front door, only to find a bigger potential threat - a group of men in baseball uniforms, their faces painted, leisurely swinging baseball bats. The Baseball Furies have been waiting for them. The four Warriors take off running down the street. The chase continues into Riverside Park. Swan and Snow split to the side, leaving Ajax and Cowboy running forward. The Furies fail to see the split, and follow Ajax and Cowboy. Swan and Snow circle to the Furies' backs. Cowboy can no longer run, so Ajax turns to face his foes, with Swan coming up from the rear. In the ensuing melee, Ajax's and Swan's fighting skills shine. They succeed in wresting control of bats and eventually in laying out all of the Furies.", "The DJ announces the Baseball Furies' defeat and disparages all the gangs for their poor performance.", "Meanwhile, Vermin, Cochise and Rembrandt have arrived at Union Square to wait for the others. They see a group of six young women giving them \"come hither\" looks. Cochise and Vermin can't believe their luck in finding attractive chicks who seem to want to party with them, naively failing to realize that the women are lesbians. Only Rembrandt, the youngest Warrior, senses the danger. They go to the group's clubhouse and the leader (Lisa Mauer) identifies them as the Lizzies, an all-girl gang and says that they want to get down with the Warriors because they've heard of their reputation. Cochise and Vermin waste no time heading off to couches with their choice of girl. Rembrandt stays aloof and says that they need to get back. He notices the women exchanging glances, but before he can react, the door is locked and the leader pulls a gun and says \"So you guys are the famous Warriors? The guys who shot Cyrus.\" Rembrandt shouts a warning and the three crash through a door, dodging bullets to escape. Rembrandt informs the others of what he has learned; that the women thought the Warriors shot Cyrus. They finally realize that every gang in the city must be looking for them.", "Swan and his crew continue walking through the park. They pass a lady on a bench (Mercedes Ruehl), who gives her best smile. Ajax decides to play games with the woman, and won't be dissuaded even after the others press on him the need to get home. Ajax disparages the others' manhood and turns back toward the woman. A few minutes later, Cowboy and Snow decide to go back to look after Ajax, and Swan continues to the station alone. The woman turns out to be an undercover cop, and Ajax is arrested when he tries to assault her, getting himself handcuffed to the bench they were sitting on. There's nothing Cowboy and Snow can do, so they make their way to Union Square.", "When Swan gets back to the 96th street station, he finds Mercy still hanging around. A cop spots them, and the two wind up running into a tunnel. Holed up in an underpass off the tracks, Mercy comes on to Swan. He insults her and says he wants to find something better. Mercy declares that Swan isn't any better than her. Swan continues on to Union Square and Mercy follows him. The Punks, who's leader wears roller skates, spot Swan on the subway platform and hang around waiting for their chance.", "Meanwhile, Snow and Cowboy have made it to Union Square and meet up with Cochise, Rembrandt and Vermin. Swan sees his fellow Warriors and signals them to lead the Punks into the men's room. They hide in the stalls, and ambush the Punks with Rembrandt's spray paint. The ensuing battle, which Mercy joins on the Warriors' side, is another victory for the Warriors.", "Back at the Riff's headquarters, Masai is told that there is a new witness who saw who really shot Cyrus.", "The six remaining Warriors board the final train home, with Mercy still in tow. Two young couples in evening dress coming from a school prom present such a contrast to Swan and Mercy that Swan takes pity on Mercy and clumsily signals that he accepts her. One of them drops a flower and Swan picks it up.", "Upon arrival at Coney Island, the sun has risen, and the journey is seemingly over. Swan gives Mercy the flower he'd picked up on the train, saying he hates seeing beautiful things go to waste. The Warriors and Mercy walk through the deserted Coney Island streets, only to realize that Luther and the Rogues are following them in a hearse. With no time to contact other members to come to their defense, the Warriors take shelter under a dock. Swan now has a switchblade he took from the Punk leader; the others arm themselves with what's around: Furies baseball bats, crowbars, hockey sticks, two-by-four pieces of wood, etc. Luther makes an ominous rattling sound with beer bottles and chants \"Warriors, come out to play-ay!\"", "Swan leads his crew and Mercy out to the beach, and the Rogues follow. Finally face to face, Swan asks Luther why he killed Cyrus, to which the crazed Luther replies: \"No reason. I just... like doing things like that.\" When Luther pulls a gun on Swan, he manages to flick his knife into Luther's wrist, disarming him. At that moment, the Gramercy Riffs appear in force on the beach. Swan asks whether the Riffs are still looking for the Warriors, to which Masai replies, looking at Luther, that they have found what they're looking for. Masai praises the Warriors as \"good, real good,\" and makes an exit path for them. They file out to the screams of Luther's death agonies.", "As the DJ announces that the alert is cancelled, the six surviving Warriors walk down their hometown beach, Swan hand-in-hand with Mercy. They are glad to have made it home, but are also emotionally defeated because they know that they and all the New York City gangs are back where they started from: nowhere."]},

Based, not on the Gospels, but on Nikos Kazantzakis' novel of the same name.", "Jesus, a carpenter in Nazareth, Judea,during the Roman occupation, has been hearing voices and having premonitions that tell him that God has a special plan for him, in atonement for sins. He assumes it is his own sins and is confused about what to do, although he has a firm will to follow any commands from God. Because he senses that he himself will be crucified some day, he constructs crosses for Roman use in executing criminals and rebels, an act of traitorous collaboration in the eyes of others in his town, including Mary Magdalene, who spits on him. Judas, a zealot rebel, appreciates Jesus' devotion to God and attempts to recruit him to the zealot cause, but Jesus refuses.", "Jesus feels guilty about his inability to correspond to the adult love of his childhood friend, Mary Magdalene, who in her dejection has become a prostitute.

Half the crowd sneaks away, the other half stays to hear what he has to say. He opens his mouth and begins his teaching in parables, awkwardly at first, but growing in confidence and preaching with the phrases recorded as the Sermon on the Mount.", "Jesus develops a following of disciples, but he is still uncertain of his role.

Choosing a spot in the desert, Jesus draws a circle on the ground and vows he will not leave the circle until God has made his will known. While in the circle, Satan appears to him, first as a snake, then as a lion, finally as a pillar of fire, to tempt him. Jesus resists these temptations.

Language professor Louise Banks joins a US army team at one of the locations, in Montana. Her job is to try to learn the aliens' language and enable communication with them. Through regular meetings with two of the aliens she starts to compile a record of the aliens' \"language\" - a series of drawn symbols. The important question is - are they friend or foe? Other nations with alien landings are starting to view them as a threat, making it a race against time as war with the aliens could erupt at any moment.", "Twelve bizarre and mysterious alien crafts situate themselves around the world, an expert linguist, Dr. Louise Banks (Amy Adams) is recruited by the military to construct a means of conversing with the aliens to discover whether they arrived with peaceful or threatening intentions. The nations of this world always think things that occur unexpectedly have destructive tendencies. Time is non-linear for the aliens, and they have different means of communication.", "In the clear skies of Montana, during an unprecedented worldwide incident of simultaneous first contact with extraterrestrial life forms, an ominous alien pod, out of twelve in total, comes to a standstill, hovering only a few feet over the green prairies. Inevitably, as panic ensues, Colonel G.T. Weber recruits a team of various experts, including the esteemed linguistics and dialectology, Professor Dr Louise Banks, and the theoretical physicist, Dr Ian Donnelly, burdening them with the impossible task to decipher a coded conversation with the intergalactic visitors. But, when all attempts to communicate prove fruitless, a practical, yet very important question will arise: does humanity have enough vocabulary to understand the aliens' answer before a new global war sparks?", "Linguist Louise Banks (Amy Adams) is caring for her adolescent daughter, who dies of cancer. While she is lecturing at a university, twelve extraterrestrial spacecraft appear. U.S. Army Colonel Weber (Forest Whitaker) asks Louise to join physicist Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) (an experimental physicist) to decipher their language and find out why they have come to Earth.", "The team is brought to a U.S. military camp in Montana near one of the spacecrafts and makes contact with two seven-limb aliens on board. They call the extraterrestrials \"Heptapods\", and Ian nicknames them Abbott and Costello. Louise discovers that they have a written language of complicated circular symbols and begins to learn the symbols that correspond to a basic vocabulary. As she becomes more proficient, she starts to see and dream vivid images of herself with a little girl whom she doesn't recognize.", "When Louise asks what the aliens want, they answer: \"offer weapon\". A similar translation \"use weapon\" is made by one of the other sites. Fear of a potential threat from the aliens leads other nations to close down communications on the project, and some prepare their military for attack. However, Louise thinks that the symbol interpreted as \"weapon\" might have an alternative translation, such as \"tool\" or \"technology\".", "Rogue U.S. soldiers plant explosives in the spacecraft. Unaware, Louise and Ian re-enter. The aliens give them a much larger and more complex message. Abbott ejects Ian and Louise from the craft as the explosion occurs, which leaves them unconscious. Louise and Ian come round in the camp as the military prepares to evacuate, and the spacecraft moves higher above the ground. Ian works out that the symbols relate to the concept of time, and that it is one-twelfth of the whole \"gift\"; they conclude that the aliens must want nations to cooperate.", "Meanwhile, China notifies the world that its military is planning to attack the spacecraft off its coast. Louise rushes back to the spacecraft, which sends down a shuttle to take her inside. She meets Costello, who communicates that Abbott is dying. Louise asks about her visions of a daughter (whom she doesn't recognize), and Costello explains that she is seeing the future, revealing that her \"visions\" were not flashbacks but flash-forwards. Costello also communicates that they have come to help humanity by sharing their language, which is the \"weapon\" or \"tool\" because it changes the mind's perception of time. The aliens know that 3000 years into the future they will need humanity's help in return. They ask her to use her \"weapon\"-her ability to see into the future.", "Louise returns as the camp is being evacuated. She has a vision of herself at a future United Nations reception, being thanked by the Chinese General Shang (Tzi Ma) for convincing him to suspend the military attack. He explains that she had called his private mobile telephone. He shows her its number, which he says he knows he must do without understanding why. In the present, Louise steals a satellite phone and calls Shang, but realizes she does not know what to say. Her vision continues with Shang explaining that she had convinced him by repeating his wife's last words in Mandarin, which he tells Louise. This convinces Shang in present time, and the Chinese attack is called off and the other nations resume contact with each other, as the spacecraft disappear from Earth.", "When packing to leave the camp, Ian admits his love for Louise. They discuss life choices, and whether they would change them if they knew the future. Louise foresees that Ian will father her daughter Hannah, whose name is an intentional palindrome, and leave her after discovering that she knew their daughter would die before adulthood. Despite seeing that Ian will leave her after revealing their daughter's future, when Louise is asked if she wants to have a baby, she agrees."]},

As witnesses to Dubrosio's activities tend to disappear, when Bonavia finds Serena, he puts her in a safe house known only to himself. Traini finally decides to start the prosecution of Bonavia, prompting Bonavia to write a full confession, including the murder of Dubrosio, which he then commits while Traini is reading the confession. Bonavia immediately turns himself in, and when the arrest is mentioned on TV, Serena calls the courthouse to inquire...only to have Dubrosio's thugs arrive at the safe house, claiming to be sent by the court.

He reassures Bonavia that the system has integrity and will serve justice in the end. Bonavia responds that prison is a different world, and one where Traini holds no influence. Bonavia is duly killed in prison, eliminating the last 'loose thread'. With that, Traini realizes that the word could only have come from the Attorney-General himself, who smugly smiles and asks \"Is something wrong?\" when finally confronted."]},

Without a second thought, the adventurous lad rescues the mysterious creature resembling a bizarre goldfish, and just like that, an exciting friendship begins. But there's more to the curious, strangely amiable marine animal than meets the eye.

She rests on top of one, domed by another, as they float towards the surface and far from her home.", "When she wakes up, she finds herself in the harbor of a seaside town, Tomonoura. When a large bottom trawler comes towards her, the goldfish swims away from the jellyfish in an attempt to escape but is quickly pulled into the mess of garbage and debris that the trawler picks up in its net. She becomes trapped within a glass jar but manages to escape the net and make it towards shallow water.

There, he notices the goldfish stuck in the jar and breaks her out of it, though cutting his thumb in the process. As he holds the seemingly lifeless fish in his hands, she licks his wound clean.

Just before she gets in, she notices Fujimoto crossing her yard with a portable pump on his back. She scolds him for spraying what she thinks is fertilizer, though he attests it's merely pure ocean water to keep him from drying out on land, before driving off. Lisa drops Sosuke off at school before going to work at the nursing home next door. Sosuke hides Ponyo's bucket in the bushes but his secrecy doesn't go unnoticed. Kumiko (English: ", ", Japanese: ", "), a classmate, asks to see what he's hiding but snubs her nose when shown Ponyo, calling her a boring fish.

Lisa is encouraged to go home though the roads soon become treacherous due to the high waves. As they drive up the hill towards their home, Sosuke notices Ponyo waving at him as she runs atop the massive waves at sea. The waves follow the car as Lisa struggles to stay on the road. When they reach the house, Ponyo transverses a wave to the road and runs up to Sosuke, hugging him tightly. Lisa takes them both into the house as the waves get bigger and the storm continues. There, she dries them off and goes to start the backup generator where Ponyo helps it using some of her magical talents. For dinner, Lisa gives them hot tea and ramen noodles. Ponyo is fascinated with the new tastes and experiences but soon grows tired and falls asleep on the couch.", "The storm dissipates to reveal some flooding. Worried about the senior center, Lisa leaves Sosuke in charge and drives down the hill to check on the seniors. Sosuke falls asleep on the couch with Ponyo. Fujimoto, having discovered the breach in his magic, finds Ponyo with Sosuke. He leaves to contact her mother, Granmamare (English: ", ", Japanese: ", "), an ocean spirit. She appears at his submersible where he tells her that Ponyo's actions have spun everything into chaos.

Only the tops of hills and the tallest trees are visible. Sosuke worries for his mother so Ponyo helps him by enlarging his toy boat. They pack a few things and set sail together. Along the way, they meet a family adrift with a small baby. Ponyo shows her generosity by offering the baby and his mother some of her soup and uses her magic to cure the baby when he comes down with a cold. As time passes and they continue their journey, Ponyo becomes more and more tired. When they reach a stretch of road that's not flooded Ponyo's magic wears off and the boat is reduced to its normal size. Sosuke sees his mother's car further up the road and runs to it, calling for Lisa. But she is no where to be seen. Sosuke becomes upset but Ponyo cheers him and encourages him to keep looking. They walk down the road hand in hand.", "Meanwhile, the senior center is completely submerged, but the elderly run about the yard with renewed energy; a result of the magic keeping them safe underwater. Fujimoto explains to them that theyre about to witness a testimony to true love while Lisa stands nearby talking to Granmamare. She returns to the others, worried about Sosuke but confident that he'll be ok.", "Sosuke and Ponyo reach a tunnel and, as they walk through it, Ponyo suddenly reverts back to her fish form and falls asleep. Sosuke quickly runs to the end of the tunnel and places her in his bucket which he fills with water. He tries to wake her up but Fujimoto appears to him. He tells Sosuke that he must accompany him to help Ponyo but someone shouts to Sosuke not to trust Fujimoto. Toki stands on a mound where the other senior citizens were brought under water, but she refused to follow. She calls to Sosuke who runs to her. As he leaps into her arms, Fujimoto's waves engulf them and bring them to the senior center under water. There, Sosuke is reunited with his mother. Granmamare approaches him and Ponyo, now awake, and calls Ponyo to her. She asks if Ponyo is willing to live as a human and give up her magic. Ponyo nods yes. Granmamare then asks Sosuke if he can love Ponyo whether she is a little girl or a fish, to which Sosuke says yes.", "Granmamare then brings everything back to normal and sends everyone back to the surface. Fujimoto shakes Sosuke's hand and bids Ponyo farewell. As he leaves, Ponyo leaps out of Sosuke's bucket, kisses him, and transforms into a little girl right before his eyes."]},

She tours the museums of Naples and Pompeii, immersing herself in the Neapolitan fascination with the dead and noticing how many women are pregnant; he idles on Capri, flirting with women but drawing back from adultery. With her, he's sarcastic; with him, she's critical. They talk of divorce. Will this foreign couple find insight and direction in Italy?"]},

But now there are no big stories and politicians react randomly to every new crisis - leaving us bewildered and disorientated. Bitter Lake is a new, adventurous and epic film by Adam Curtis that explains why the big stories that politicians tell us have become so simplified that we can't really see the world any longer. The narrative goes all over the world, America, Britain, Russia and Saudi Arabia - but the country at the heart of it is Afghanistan. Because Afghanistan is the place that has confronted our politicians with the terrible truth - that they cannot understand what is going on any longer. The film reveals the forces that over the past thirty years rose up and undermined the confidence of politics to understand the world. And it shows the strange, dark role that Saudi Arabia has played in this. But Bitter Lake is also experimental. Curtis has taken the unedited rushes of everything that the BBC has ever shot in Afghanistan - and used them in new and radical ways. He has tried to build a different and more emotional way of depicting what really happened in Afghanistan. A counterpoint to the thin, narrow and increasingly destructive stories told by those in power today."]},

She works as a waitress in a diner--she isn't very good at it and is soon fired--and has a loafing philanderer for a husband.

She is currently the sole breadwinner, a diner waitress--until her daydreaming at work, specifically about the lives of movie characters--gets her fired. The latest of these movies is a lighthearted comic adventure called \"The Purple Rose of Cairo,\" which she has now seen several times. During one of those screenings, Tom Baxter, a secondary but pivotal character in the movie--a self-described poet, explorer, and adventurer--walks off the screen into the audience, stating that he has seen Cecilia at several screenings before, and fallen in love with her, and Tom and Cecilia take off together. This causes may problems: the other characters on the screen can't continue without Tom, studio executives are concerned about anything libelous that Tom might do for which they would be legally responsible, and they are concerned that other characters from the movie will also walk off, not only at this theater but at others where the movie is being screened. Cecilia also sees it as a problem; although she likes Tom and likes being with him, she knows that he's not real. Another person who sees it as a problem is Gil Shepherd, the up-and-coming young actor who portrays Tom; he sees Tom's move as potentially destroying his career. But as Gil gave Tom life in his portrayal, there could be some of Gil in Tom. So when Gil heads to New Jersey to try to persuade Tom to go back into the movie, Gil, a real person, could also also see in Cecilia what Tom sees in her.", "In mid-1930s New Jersey, Cecilia (Mia Farrow) is a waitress stuck in a loveless, dead-end marriage to obnoxious, philandering, gambling Monk (Danny Aiello).

Reggie asks \"Peter\" to take her back to their hotel, and while \"Peter\" wants to know what happened at the club, Reggie wants to flirt, and is scared to give any more details. Frustrated, \"Peter\" leaves Reggie to go into her room--and then Reggie, once inside, finds Scobie inside. He has turned the room upside down and now attacks her with his claw \"hand.\" She rushes out, finds \"Peter,\" and breathlessly says that \"a man\" tried to kill her. \"Peter\" rushes in, and Reggie hears fight noises, and then silence. She bursts in, and finds that \"Peter\" is a little the worse for wear, and Scobie fled out the window. \"Peter\" tells Reggie to lock herself in, while he goes out the window and gives chase--by jumping from balcony to balcony.", "In fact, \"Peter\" knows exactly where to go: to Gideon's room on that same floor. He finds Gideon, Tex, and Scobie inside. Tex and Gideon are bawling Scobie out for accosting Reggie by himself. \"Peter\" steps in through the window and joins in the \"bawling out,\" and tells the \"Three Marx Brothers\" to stop \"breathing down [his] neck\" and let him gain Reggie's trust and find out whether she has the money or not. Scobie stalks out again, and \"Peter\" prevails on Tex to let him have his room, which is the room next to Reggie's.", "\"Peter\" goes back down the hall and tells Reggie that he found \"no trace\" of Scobie. Now he insists that Reggie tell him what's happening. She tells him all she knows, which isn't much. \"Peter\" pledges that he will simply not allow any of those three to kill her. In the middle of this conversation, Reggie gets a call--from Scobie, who asks her whether \"Dyle\" is in the room with her. In other words, \"Peter Joshua\" is actually a man named \"Dyle,\" a name she does not recognize. Reggie hangs up, and tells \"Peter\" that the call was simply another threat, and \"Peter\" says that he has \"arranged\" to take the room next to hers.", "\"Peter\" leaves the room, but then, using a thread unraveled from his sock, prepares a trap to let him know whether she's leaving the room. Unaware, Reggie calls Bartholomew and shocks him with the revelation that \"someone else,\" named \"Dyle,\" is also after the money. Bartholomew instructs Reggie to meet him at once at Les Halles, opposite the St. Eustace church. Reggie leaves, figures out that \"Peter\" (now known as \"Dyle\") is behind her, and shakes him loose by paying a taxi to drive off to any old place, and waiting for \"Dyle\" to get into the next cab and say, \"Follow that cab!\"", "At Les Halles, Bartholomew reveals the full story as the CIA knows it: in 1944, five members of the Office of Strategic Services were ordered to go behind German lines and deliver $250,000 in gold to the French Résistance. The five were, of course, Charles, Tex, Gideon, Scobie--and one Carson Dyle. Instead of delivering the gold, they buried it, intending to report that the Germans had captured it. But on their way back to base, a German war patrol ambushed them. Scobie lost his right hand in the attack, and Carson Dyle took several rounds in the stomach. Scobie could still travel, but Dyle was presumably dead, so the four left him behind and returned to base. Charles then double-crossed the other three by stealing all the gold for himself and vanishing.", "Bartholomew wants to know who the man calling himself \"Dyle\" could possible be, because Carson Dyle is dead. Reluctantly, Reggie agrees. The next morning, she follows \"Dyle\" to the American Express office--where, sure enough, he goes to the \"A to D\" counter to check for mail, and finds nothing. Reggie then goes into a phone booth, calls the operator, and has \"Dyle\" paged. \"Dyle\" answers, and Reggie lets him know that she has him red-handed.", "\"Dyle\" tells a new story: Carson Dyle is his dead brother, and he suspects Gideon, Tex, Scobie, and Charles of having murdered Carson Dyle because he objected to their plan to steal the gold. He also assurs Reggie that he is on her side, not theirs. But in the middle of their conversation, \"Dyle\" drops the telephone and leaves his booth.", "The reason: Scobie has taken him hostage at gunpoint. Scobie and \"Dyle\" ride to the top floor, where Scobie holds Dyle until the AmEx staff close for the day, then orders \"Dyle\" to the roof. There Scobie demands that \"Dyle\" hand over the money. \"Dyle\" says that he does not have it, and wouldn't surrender it if he did. Scobie orders \"Dyle\" to step off the roof, but gets too close, so \"Dyle\" knocks the gun out of his hand. The two struggle with might and main--and then Scobie falls onto the steeply inclined mansard and ends up hanging by his prosthetic hook from the gutter. \"Dyle\" cheerfully advises him to write \"Love Thy Neighbor\" on the wall 100 times.", "\"Dyle\" goes back to Reggie and tells her that he \"ran into someone with sharp fingernails.\" Reggie treats his badly-scratched back, and from him learns his \"new\" last name: Alexander. The two start flirting again, and then Reggie gets another horrifying call from Tex, saying that the three men have Jean-Louis as a hostage.", "Reggie and \"Dyle\" both show up in Tex's new room. There \"Dyle\" tells the men that of course the boy doesn't have the money, and neither does Reggie. He then offers a new theory: that one of the three found Charles first, cornered him on the train, killed him, and then, without telling the other two, took the money and returned to Paris to blend in until they gave up. He proposes that the three can search his room and Reggies, and he and Reggie will search their rooms. The three men grudgingly agree. Gideon and Tex find Charles' effects in Reggie's room, and don't find anything worth $250,000--whereupon Tex wonders aloud whether \"Dyle\" was right. Reggie and Jean-Louis search Scobie's room and succeed only in finding Scobie's spare prosthetic. Then \"Dyle\" leads them all back to his own room--where they find Scobie, drowned in the bathtub. Gideon and Tex agree to take Scobie back to his own room and dry him off.", "After the hotel maid (Claudine Berg) makes the inevitable horrifying discovery, Inspector Grandpierre summons Reggie, \"Dyle,\" Gideon, and Tex to his office. He tells them quite severely not to leave Paris until he has found out how these two men died.", "Reggie and \"Dyle\" spend one-third of their time trying to figure out which of the two remaining cutthroats killed Scobie and Charles, and the rest of the time flirting, first near L'Île de la Cité and then back in her room (where \"Dyle\" famously takes a shower with his clothes on). While this is going on, Bartholomew calls Reggie to tell her that Carson Dyle had no brother. Reggie still agrees to go out to dinner with \"Dyle,\" but at a place with a lot of people: one of the floating restaurants of the Seine.", "There Reggie tells her mystery man that Carson Dyle had no brother. Whereupon the mystery man, giving the name Adam Canfield, says that he is, quite simply, a thief, and was simply trying to con the three cutthroats out of money they themselves stole. \"Adam\" also tells Reggie, speaking very clearly about such things for the first time, that he is very attracted to her.", "That night, Gideon takes a call at 3:30 a.m. to come down to the lobby. He gets on the elevator, which then stops between floors, the lights going out. Then the elevator starts again--and goes all the way to the basement. Gideon keeps sneezing--and then lets out a blood-curdling scream that causes the concierge (Bernard Musson) to wake up and call the elevator back to street level--only to find the dead Gideon inside, his throat cut.", "An angry Grandpierre notes that three men have died, all in their pajamas, and that Tex has disappeared. Grandpierre questions Reggie and \"Adam\" about their whereabouts, and accepts their alibis (for why would they invent the story that each was in his or her room, asleep, and alone?). Satisfied that Tex took the money and ran, \"Adam\" tells Reggie to go back to bed. But then \"Adam\" gets a call from Tex, who now is threatening to stalk \"Adam,\" still known to Tex as \"Dyle,\" for the money!", "\"Adam\" asks Reggie to go over Charles' effects with him one more time; they conclude that their search is at a dead end. But the next morning, \"Adam\" breathlessly goes to see Reggie at the EURESCO offices. He has found the torn-up remnants of the list that Grandpierre prepared of the effects, pasted it back together, and realized that Tex has made off with the appointment book. Reggie recalls the last appointment: Thursday at 5:00 p.m. The two abruptly leave EURESCO and rush to The Garden to look around. They don't know what to look for, but neither does Tex, who also is skulking around.", "The two then split up. \"Adam\" follows Tex, who wanders into the stamp market, and suddenly realizes the significance! He brushes past Adam, who then also realizes that stamps are the key! The two then race each other back to the hotel. There \"Adam\" catches up with Tex and demands that Tex hand over the stamped-but-unsealed letter. Tex hands \"Adam\" the envelope--but the stamps are torn off, and Tex doesn't have them either.", "Reggie, meanwhile, has caught up with Sylvie, who tells him that she has brought Jean-Louis to the stamp market, where Jean-Louis hoped to trade the three strange-looking stamps that Reggie gave him. Reggie now realizes that the stamps are the form into which Charles had converted the money! They barely catch up to Jean-Louis, who identifies Monsieur Félix (Paul Bonifas) as the man to whom he sold the stamps. Félix receives them gladly and agrees to sell the stamps back for an amount of money more in line with the collection of tourist-grade stamps he gave Jean-Louis in exchange. The reason: Félix knew that someone had made a mistake, and was just as glad of the honor of owning three of the most valuable stamps in the world, even for five minutes.", "Reggie rushes back to tell \"Adam,\" but then finds a terrible sight: Tex, bound hand and foot to the two radiators in his room, with a plastic bag over his head, and obviously dead. But worse: he has written the word DYLE on the carpet. To Reggie, DYLE means \"Alexander,\" therefore \"Adam.\" Upset, she calls Bartholomew to tell him about finding Tex, and about the stamps. Bartholomew tells her to meet him at once at the center garden at the Palais Royal, near the colonnade.", "But as Reggie leaves, \"Adam\" is on his way back. So now \"Adam\" gives furious chase to Reggie. She, not able to hail a taxi, tries to shake \"Adam\" in the Paris Métro. She manages to get to the district where the Palais Royal stands, and to shake \"Adam\" long enough to call the American embassy and ask for Hamilton Bartholomew. The operator informs her that Bartholomew has left for the day, so Reggie leaves a breathless message for him.", "The embassy operator then calls the home of Hamilton Bartholomew (Colin Drake), who is not the man whom Reggie saw in an embassy office! The real Bartholomew is totally mystified and advises the operator to call the French police. But the man who posed as Bartholomew is waiting for Reggie to come to him, with \"Adam\" in hot pursuit.", "Upon seeing the poseur, \"Adam\" draws his gun and shouts, \"Reggie, stop! That man is Carson Dyle!\"", "How \"Adam\" would know who Carson Dyle is, Reggie has no time to figure out--because the man she thought was a CIA station chief admits that his name really is Carson Dyle, and that he stalked Charles, Scobie, Gideon, and Tex in revenge for having left him for dead. He threatens to kill Reggie if she does not hand over the stamps right then and there--but \"Adam\" has moved from column to column to get closer to Dyle. He takes aim--and misses, but distracts Dyle enough for Reggie to bolt for it.", "Reggie takes refuge in the Paris Opera House. Dyle follows her in the front door, and \"Adam\" gets in through the stage door and walks down to the lower backstage level. Reggie has taken refuge in a prompt booth, while Dyle walks through the orchestra seating section and then gets up on the stage. \"Adam\" makes a serious mistake: he tries the prompt booth door, and that only lets Dyle know where she is. Slowly he walks, with clumping footsteps, toward the prompt booth--and \"Adam\" realizes that the stage is composed of trap doors. All that \"Adam\" has to do is wait for Dyle to stop walking, identify the right trap door, and throw the switch. And that is how he kills Dyle just as he is drawing back the trigger to kill Reggie.", "\"Adam\" and Reggie go back to the hotel, where Reggie wants \"Adam\" to prove his love to her by telling her to go to the American Embassy and turn in the stamps. \"Adam\" protests that the US government would barely miss the money, but Reggie insists. A Marine directs her to the office of \"Mr. Cruikshank,\" Treasury attaché. She goes there, and \"Adam\" excuses himself, saying that he can't stand the sight of \"all that money being given away.\" Reggie goes into the office, announces herself, and then goes into the private office to meet Mr. Cruikshank face-to-face. And he turns out to be none other than the mystery man.", "Reggie protests strongly at such deception, but the man, whose full and true name is Brian Cruikshank, cheerfully answers all her questions, explaining especially how Carson Dyle could pass himself off as a CIA station chief. (The answer: 12:30 is the lunch hour, and Dyle took the office belonging to none other than the chief of Embassy security!) Reggie still wants more satisfactory identification, and Bryan almost casually says that if she could wait a week, he would \"put it on the marriage license.\" Whereupon she breathlessly tells him that she loves him, \"whatever [his] name is,\" and promises to bear him lots of sons and name them all after him."]},

Sprung from a chain gang and trying to reach Everett's home to recover the buried loot of a bank heist they are confronted by a series of strange characters--among them sirens, a cyclops, bank robber George \"Baby Face\" Nelson (very annoyed by that nickname), a campaigning governor and his opponent, a KKK lynch mob, and a blind prophet who warns the trio that \"the treasure you seek shall not be the treasure you find.\"", "Mississippi, 1937. Three convicts escape from a jail chain-gang intent on getting to the loot stashed away by one of them. As this is at his house soon to be flooded by a new dam, speed is of the essence. They find themselves fast-talking their way out of one jam after another, and along the way not only have to be wary of riverside sirens but even get to make a pretty good country record.", "Ulysses Everett McGill (George Clooney), a suave, fast-taking convict, escapes from incarceration at a chain gang in rural Mississippi in 1937 during the Great Depression. He is chained to two other prisoners, slow-witted Delmar (Tim Blake Neslon) and hot-tempered Pete (John Turturro), so the three must escape together. Everett convinces them that he has hidden $1.2 million after robbing an armored car, and promises to split it with them. They hitch a ride with an elderly blind man on a railway handcar, and he foretells that they will indeed find a treasure, though it may not be the one they seek.", "They travel on foot to visit Pete's cousin, Washington Hogwallop, who removes their shackles, gives them new clothes, and allows them to sleep in his barn for the night. However, the trio is awakened by the authorities, led by the partly-blinded World War I veteran Sheriff Cooley (Daniel Von Bargen) after Hogwallop had turned them in for the reward. The barn is set ablaze, but Everett, Pete, and Delmar escape with the help of Hogwallop's rambunctious young son (who drives them out of the fiery barn in a car).", "They continue their journey, and encounter a religious congregation in the midst of a mass baptism. Pete and Delmar are drawn in and are baptized as well, but Everett resists. They later pick up a hitchhiking young black guitarist, named Tommy Johnson (Chris Thomas King), who claims he sold his soul to the devil in exchange for musical talent. They hear that the nearby WEZY radio station pays people to sing into a can, so they pay a visit to the blind disc jockey (Stephen Root), and sing a version of \"Man of Constant Sorrow\" with Tommy accompanying them. Calling themselves 'The Soggy Bottom Boys', they are paid $40 in cash and leave satisfied. However, unbeknownst to them, their record becomes wildly popular around the state, with no one knowing the identity of the band.", "That night, the shadowy Sheriff Cooley and police track them down and find their car near their campsite. Everett, Pete, and Delmar part ways with Tommy as they escape. The next day, they meet famed robber George 'Babyface' Nelson (Michael Badalucco), on the run from police, and accompany him in robbing a bank.

Delmar and Everett discover the next morning that Pete has disappeared, and Delmar believes the women had turned him into a toad (which was found in Pete's abandoned clothes). Carrying \"Pete\" in a shoe box, Delmar and Everett go to a restaurant for breakfast where they meet Big Dan Teague (John Goodman), a one-eyed Bible salesman. Thinking that their box contains money, Big Dan lures them to a field for an advanced tutorial on salesmanship. He violently beats the two men, kills the toad after finding no cash, and steals their car and what money they have on them.", "Bruised and defeated, Everett and Delmar arrive at Everett's hometown, where he attempts to speak to his estranged wife, Penny (Holly Hunter), mother of his seven daughters. He finds that Penny is engaged to Vernon T. Waldrip, the campaign manager for Homer Stokes (Wayne Duvall), who is running for governor against the grouchy elderly incumbent, Pappy O'Daniel (Charles Durning). Penny refuses to take Everett back, and was so ashamed of his arrest that she told their daughters he was hit by a train and killed.", "Rejected, Everett and Delmar attend a movie, where a prison chain gang is in the audience.

In the theater, Pete advises his friends to abandon their quest, as it is a \"bushwhack.\"", "That night, Everett and Delmar stealthily break him out of jail. Pete tearfully confesses that, after threatened with death by the authorities, he revealed their plans to find the armored car loot for Sheriff Cooley, whom they finally learn is the one who has been hunting them across the state. However, Everett reveals that he fabricated the story to entice Pete and Delmar to escape with him. Everett had truthfully been arrested for practicing law without a license, and was determined to escape when he heard his wife planned to remarry.

From there, he sets out in search of three undeveloped film reels made at the turn of the century by a pair of pioneering Greek filmmakers, the Manaki Brothers. As 'A' embarks on a long Balkan quest to unearth the fabled footage and find his lost innocence, a dangerous, emotional journey from Athens to war-ravaged Sarajevo begins, unfolding the director's odyssey.", "A., a Greek film maker exiled to the United States, returns to his native town to attend a special screening of one of his extremely controversial films. But A.'s real interest lies elsewhere- the mythical reels of the very first film shot by the Manakias brothers who, without regard for national and ethnic strife, recorded the region's history and customs. Did these primitive, never developed images really exist? If so, where are they?", "In \"Ulysses' Gaze\" (\"To Vlemma Tou Odyssea,\" 1995), a Greek-American filmmaker, not named in the film, and only referred to as \"A\" in the script, is on a quest to find three lost reels of undeveloped film, the first ever produced in Greece, from around 1905. These films are in fact the first cinematographic record, the first \"gaze\" in the philosophical sense, into the soul of the region. As the title implies, the story will take the form of an odyssey that begins in Greece and continues through Albania (the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, known to the Greeks as the Republic of Skopje), Bulgaria, Rumania, Serbia, and finally Bosnia.", "The film opens with an old black and white silent film that shows some village women weaving. In a voice-over, Harvey Keitel comments, \"Weavers in Avdella, a Greek Village, 1905, the first film made by the brothers Miltiades and Yannakis Manakis, [who filmed] all the ambiguities, the contrasts, the conflicts in this area of the world.\" For those of you who would watch \"Ulysses' Gaze\" only to find out if these three films ever existed, you now know the answer, and you don't have to watch to the end. But if you follow the advice of the Greek poet C. P. Cavafi, in his poem \"Ithaca\" (1911): \"When you start on your journey to Ithaca, / then pray that the road is long, / full of adventure, full of knowledge\", then you will enjoy the next 180 minutes of the journey.", "Following this antique piece of film showing the weaving village women, and before the opening titles, we see a small masterpiece of a scene, as only Angelopoulos can produce. An old man, standing on a quay, is getting his old-type camera ready to film a sailing ship coming out of the harbor of Salonika. The old man is Yannakis Manakis, and the scene, which took place in 1954, is recounted to \"A\" out of the camera's field of view by an old man who had been Manakis's assistant at that time. The assistant is not shown as he would have been at the time, but as he is today. While we watch Manakis finish preparing his camera and his assistant standing behind him recounting the event, the films takes on color. As the blue ship appears on the right side of the screen, Manakis is struck by a heart attack and collapses in a chair. The assistant walks toward the right of the screen, all the while continuing with his story. The camera scans to the right, and we discover \"A\" standing. \"A\" walks leftward, passing the point where we had just seen Manakis and his camera, but they are no longer there. We continue following \"A\" walking to the left, until the blue ship reappears in the field of view. The camera now follows the ship, slowly zooming in, until the ship stands still and fills the screen. Eventually, the camera stops tracking the ship and it disappears to the left. We are contemplating a blue-grey sea that dissolves into a sky of the same color. In his long shot, Angelopoulos has covered sixty years, and set the tone for the whole journey.", "As the film begins, \"A\" (Harvey Keitel) has arrived in a rainy Florina, a town in northern Greece, where one of his films is to be shown. The film is somehow controversial, and religious fanatics plan to demonstrate against its screening. One of the screening organizers advises \"A\" to leave town for his own safety. As \"A\" is about to enter a taxi, a woman (Maia Morgenstern) in her thirties passes him by and \"A,\" apparently stunned, follows her, muttering to himself: \"I did not expect you here.\" She disappears between the groups of demonstrators and counter-demonstrators who face each other. Morgenstern, who plays the roles of four different women in the film, is \"A's\" old love whom he left years ago, and therefore, a Penelope figure. The two groups rush toward each other, but the resulting confrontation is left unseen.", "Cut to a dreary winter day, with snow on the ground. \"A\" arrives at an Albanian border crossing in a taxi. While the taxi driver (Thanassis Vengos) tends to the police formalities, \"A\" notices an older lady (Dora Volanaki) with a suitcase standing nearby. \"A\" walks toward her, and she asks if he could give her a lift to a town over the border. She plans to visit her sister, whom she has not seen for forty-five years. \"A\" agrees and helps her into the taxi. Just then, a group of people arrives in a bus: they are illegal Albanian immigrants who were rounded up by the Greek police and are being return to their home country. As \"A's\" taxi proceeds across the Albanian side of the border, we see all along the road, in a desolate and gloomy snowy landscape, hundreds of Albanians standing like statues, waiting for a chance to sneak into Greece. The taxi reaches the town of Korytsa, stops in the middle of an empty square, and \"A\" helps the lady out. The taxi leaves, and a tracking-back long shot reveals the isolation and desolation of the town.", "The taxi continues toward the Macedonian border, but it has to stop because of snow on the road. The friendly taxi driver sensibly decides against a perilous crossing, and settles down, waiting for the snow to be cleared. He engages \"A\" in a conversation while listening to Greek music and drinking. He says, \"Greece is dying.We are dying as a people,\" reflecting on the present situation of Greece and its people.", "\"A\" arrives, apparently on a bus in Monastiri, in the Republic of Skopje. He is looking for the original home of the Manakis brothers. He stands in front of the door, and the film dissolves into old black and white footage made around 1956 by the Manakis brothers. The house is now a museum, and \"A\" enters. Inside, he briefly meets with a young lady (Maia Morgenstern), who gives him the cold shoulder. Later that evening, on the train to Skopje, \"A\" meets her again. He explains in detail his journey's purpose, and we learn that the young woman's name is Kali, which stands for Calypso, the goddess who held Ulysses captive for seven years on her island, Ogygia.. Kali tells \"A\" that the Manakis' films are not in the Skopje film archives. In Skopje, \"A\" is continuing on by train to Bulgaria and Kali is on the platform. \"A\" recounts to her an event he witnessed two years earlier on the island of Delos. The train has started leaving the station and is picking up speed. Kali is running on the platform alongside the train, fascinated by \"A's\" story. Finally, \"A\" grabs her and pulls her aboard. He continues his story, and Kali is so moved by it that she does not resist \"A's\" passionate embrace. She will now share \"A's\" journey.", "The train pulls in the station at the border. \"A\" and Kali are asked to step down -- apparently, there is something wrong with \"A's\" passport. Past and present mix once more: the train station alters and \"A\" finds himself being interrogated by an official dressed in turn-of-the-century clothing. \"A\" is now being addressed as if he were Yannakis Manakis. He is accused of sedition against the state of Bulgaria.. Although \"A\" protests that he does not understand, he is blindfolded and taken before a firing squad. At the last moment, a messenger arrives: King Ferdinand of Bulgaria has commuted Yannakis Manakis' sentence to exile until the war (The Balkan war of 1912-13) is over.", "\"A\" is reunited with Kali outside the contemporary police station. They board another train for Bucharest. As they step off the train, a young women (Mania Papadimitriou) in 1940's dress comes and addresses \"A\" as if he were a child. \"A,\" in turn, calls her \"Mother,\" and he apologizes for missing her funeral. Once more, we find ourselves in a time-warp, where \"A\" has returned to \"his\" childhood. They board a bus that takes them to their old home in Kostantza, on the Black Sea. They enter the house, where all of \"A's\" deceased \"relatives\" are dancing. He greets each one in turn, as a well-mannered child would. A man in rags appears in the room: it is his \"father\" returning from prison. The celebration of the father's return and of the New Year begins. We are in 1945, and there has been a temporary switch in the roles: \"A,\" as Telemachus, is greeting the return of his \"father,\" Ulysses. This is a familiar style that Angelopoulos has used in \"The Travelling Players,\" where this single scene, lasting some fifteen minutes in one continuous shot, covers five years as the characters waltz through the 1948 arrest of an uncle, to the 1950 New Year's Eve celebration, when the family is finally allowed to return to Greece. Through this scene, we now understand that \"A's\" memory has now merged with that of the Manakis' brothers.", "\"A\" awakens in a contemporary hotel in Kostantza, with Kali at his side. They go to the harbor, where a huge statue of Lenin is being loaded on a barge, in preparation for traveling up the Danube to Germany. A tearful \"A\" tells Kali, \"I cannot love you,\" just as Homer's Ulysses tells Calypso upon leaving her. \"A\" climbs aboard the barge, leaving a bewildered Kali on the quay. As the barge proceeds up the Danube River, groups of people on the riverbank stand in awe, many crossing themselves. This long traveling shot, accompanied by ethereal music, reminds us of the taxi ride in Albania. Toward the end of this shot, Arvanitis' camera, as if looking into Lenin's soul, circles slowly around the broken head of the statue, as a meditation on a ruin of the past.", "Arriving in Belgrade, \"A\" is met by his old friend, Nikos (Giogos Michalakopoulos) who, paraphrasing Angelopoulos' favorite poet, George Seferis, greats him with, \"When God created the World, the first thing he made were journeys.\" To which \"A\" answers, \"and then came doubt and nostalgia.\" They go to an old people's home, where they meet with an old man who was once in charge of the Belgrade Film Archives. The old man says that the Menakis' films are now with one of his friends at the Sarajevo Film Archives. Nikos and \"A\" end up in a café, drinking to the memories of old friends, and continue their voyage into nostalgia while drinking in the street. Obviously, Belgrade has become Ulysses' descent into Hades in the Odyssey, where he went to meet old friends and get instructions to complete his journey. \"A\" decides that despite the danger, he must go to Sarajevo. Nikos tells him to follow one of the many rivers which lead to it.", "Night time. \"A,\" asleep in an old shack, is being awakened by a young lady (Maia Morgenstern, yet again). They are in Philipoupolis, Bulgaria, and the year is 1915. Morgenstern now assumes the role of Homer's Circe, the sorceress. She leads \"A\" to the river, and they escape in a small boat. The next scene shows them on a bright morning, floating down the river. The couple eventually lands on the shore of a village in ruins, and they walk to a particular house, which used to be the woman's. The house, gutted by a conflagration, is in ruins. The woman, grief-stricken, desperately calls out, \"Vania!\" the name of her husband, who must have perished during the village's destruction. In the debris, \"A\" finds a picture frame with a turn-of-the-century wedding picture, which most likely is that of the woman and Vania. In a somewhat surrealist scene, a table with a white tablecloth has been set up in the midst of the rubble, and it is there in the evening where \"A\" and his companion have dinner. In the background, the rumble of guns and sharp explosions can be heard.", "When \"A\" wakes up, he is naked. He wraps himself in a blanket, walks outside, and sees the woman washing his clothes. She comes back to the house and gives him some of her husband's clothes. The woman goes to the river and demolishes the boat with an axe, obviously in order to hold \"A\" captive, as Circe also tried to do with Ulysses. She returns to the house, and seeing \"A\" dressed up in her husband's clothes, pulls him to the floor and makes passionate love to him.", "In the next scene, in the darkness, \"A\" has escaped Circe. He is drifting down the river in a small boat. At dawn, he arrives in Sarajevo. He eventually finds his way to the Film Archives, where he meets a young boy who takes him to an underground market to meet the Archives curator, a Jewish man by the name of Ivo Levy (Erland Josephson). They walk back to the gutted Film Archives building, each carrying containers of water. The siege of Sarajevo has been going on for some time, and the whole town is in ruins, its infrastructure destroyed. People risk their lives daily while fetching water at some of the still functioning water fountains, braving the bullets of Serbian snipers. Running back to the Film Archives, \"A\" explains to Levy the purpose of his coming to Sarajevo. Levy does have the three films and has tried repeatedly to find the correct chemical formula to develop them, but to no avail. . However, impressed by \"A's\" courage and determination, Levy says, \"You must have great faith, or is it despair?\" and agrees to try one more time.", "At the Film Archives, \"A\" goes to sleep and when he awakens, he meets a young woman, Levy's daughter, Noami (<i> Maia Morgenstern in her fourth role), a contemporary Nausicaa;. \"A\" is obviously struck by Noami's familiar face. By now, we understand that \"A\" has projected his past lovers in every woman he meets. Noami leaves, and \"A,\" looking around, sees that Levy has already started to get the lab working again. Later that night, Levy wakes up \"A\" and brings him to his lab where the development of a roll of film is in progress. At last, Levy is successful. \"A\" and the archivist are overwhelmed with joy and they embrace: after almost 100 years of being captive, an image of Greece from the turn of the century has at last been set free.", "The whole place is now flooded with fog. Levy explains that this is a welcome time for the inhabitants of Sarajevo: because of the fog, the Serbian snipers cannot operate, and the population is free to come outside their shelter and enjoy the open air. As \"A\" and Levy walk past a cemetery, we see some people taking advantage of the lull to bury their dead, Moslem and Orthodox Christians alike. The two friends come across an orchestra playing in a small square. Levy explains that it is made up of young Muslim, Croat, and Serb musicians. There is also a small production of \"Romeo and Juliet\" going on.", "Further on, some couples are dancing to a rock tune. Out of the fog, Naomi appears and invites \"A\" to dance. The music changes to a 1950s tune, and Naomi has now become the Penelope whom \"A\" had left behind in Florina, long time ago.", "Levy's family joins the trio and they walk together in the fog toward the river, with Levy and \"A\" straggling behind. Suddenly, there is a noise of a car stopping, doors slamming, and men's voices. Levy tells \"A\" to stay put and runs in the fog to rejoin the rest of the family. We hear Naomi's cry of, \"not the children!\" as gun shots are followed by splashes as bodies are dumped into the water. The car leaves and there is total, eerie silence. Throughout, we stare at the fog, only able to guess at the events that have just occurred. As always, Angelopoulos lets us contemplate the meaning of violence, rather than actually showing it. \"A\" runs to the spot of the massacre where he first finds Levy dead in the snow, and then Naomi. He embraces her, embracing at the same time all the women he has loved and lost. In helpless rage and anger, he releases several heart-wrenching screams. He returns slowly to the Film Archives, passing once more by the still-playing orchestra.", "The final scene shows a blank projection screen where a film has just been shown, most likely one of the Manakis' films. Then, a close-up shot of \"A,\" followed by a zoom backward, as he speaks Ulysses' lines to Penelope,", "\"When I return, it will be with another man's clothes\"", "\"A\" has reached his Ithaca, but his odyssey may not be over yet, as he is now looking toward another Ithaca."]},

But the corpse keeps returning, and the police eventually capture a local woman, who is accused of digging it up. She says that Varlam should never be laid to rest because he was responsible for a Stalin-like reign of terror that led to the disappearance of many of her friends...", "The film Repentance begins with a woman baking cakes designed to look like churches and moments later discovering that a man, Varlam Aravidze, has died. It's rather obvious that she isn't sorrowful over the death, unlike her male companion who cries that he was \"a great man\". The film moves forward to Varlam's funeral, with a line of people moving before Varlam's family and sharing their condolences. Varlam's grandson is the only one who seems genuinely saddened by his passing. Following his funeral and burial, Varlam's corpse is soon unearthed and propped up against the tree outside his son, Abel's, residence, much to the family's horror. In response the authorities arrest Varlam's corpse. At the advice of his \"fool\" neighbor, Abel decides to rebury Varlam but to contract a cage around his grave. The next morning Varlam's corpse in unearthed once again and sat casually at a table in Abel's backyard. After this the police stand guard overnight and quickly discover the culprit responsible- it's the woman who was baking cakes at the start of the film. We find out that the woman's name is Keti Barateli, and she was the daughter of an artist named Sandro and his beautiful wife, Nino. Keti recalls Varlam being elected mayor when she was 8 and her father taking issue with Varlam's use of their ancient church for experiments that are ruining the infrastructure of the cathedral. Sandro argues that the destruction of the church means the destruction of the history and culture that give life to their people. He says destroy the church, \"then throw into fire the works of Rustaveli and Dante! Stop playing Bach, Beethoven, Verdi. Let's demolish the St. Peter Church, Notre Dame, Svetitskhoveli.\" Varlam appears to give in a bit to those imploring him to maintain the safety of the church but then threatens Sandro by casually informing him he know's where he lives and saw his young daughter (8 year old Keti) blowing bubbles during his mayoral parade. He then proceeds to arrest the two people who had joined Sandro to argue on behalf of the church, but shortly after it is said that they were released. Varlam then show's up at Sandro's apartment and hits on his wife and gives Keti some birds before sending her off to play with his son Abel. Varlam begins to tell Sandro that he needs and artist like him to enlighten the people and culturally enrich them, to which Sandro replies that people can only be enlightened by a spiritual pastor. Keti and Abel and shown looking at a crucifix and Keti is explaining Jesus to Abel and how he is alive in heaven- Abel asks about his diseased mother and whether Jesus could revive her. Nino overhears and tells young Abel that his mother is alive in heaven. Varlam then performs William Shakespeare's Sonnet 66, stating \"a regime is a regime\" before exiting Sandro's apartment through the window with his men and his son. Moments later Varlam returns and explains that Abel took the crucifix believing it could revive his mom- he gives it to Nino saying \"take care of it, this is a very valuable thing.\"\nNino has a dream where she and Sandro are being chased through the town by Varlam and his men and then out into a field where they attempt to hide by burying themselves in dirt before being discovered by Varlam who then sings the same song he had performed in their apartment earlier that evening. She wakes and tells Sandro that they must leave town, and Sandro reassures her that there is nothing they could be arrested for. Seconds later the doorbell rings and two of Varlam's soldiers tell Sandro he must come with them while they begin taking Sandro's art from his walls. Varlam then argues with Sandro's friend Mikhail Korisheli (who is also the local Party Secretary) after Mikhail dismisses a letter detailing Sandro's arrest as ridiculous. Varlam informs Mikhail that he and Sandro are related and says he is the enemy now- in response, Mikhail slaps Varlam.\nNino and Keti go with a slip of paper to a line presumably meant to tell them information on Sandro's wellbeing. A woman and her daughter hand over their paper and give their name and are told \"the parcel was received\" and the woman is relieved to the point of tears before walking away satisfied. The next woman is told whoever she is looking for has been exiled and she begins to argue and cries \"just tell us he's dead!\" Nino and Keti hand over their paper and are told Sandro has been exiled (so he has most likely been killed.)\nWe unsurprisingly learn that Mikhail has been arrested and Nino is left in a room alone with pictures of Varlam on sticks from his parade. She throws one on the ground and jabs it with a stick before noticing Varlam is standing in the room with her. She immediately stops and begins to praise him before falling to her knees and begging for him to help her; he responds by walking away. Soon after we see Keti and Nino searching a lumber yard for Sandro's body. Next we see Sandro being questioned in a garden by a piano-playing tuxedo-ed man and accompanied by a blindfolded woman holding the scales of justice. They bring out Mikhail who agrees he was a member of an organization attempting to dig a tunnel from Bombay to London and that Sandro was also a member. The tuxedo man leaves them to talk in private, leading the blindfolded woman with him. Mikhail has a sort of psychotic episode and collapses while Sandro sadly looks on. Varlam is shown giving an erratic, fear-inspiring speech to the town and then we see Nino being comforted by Yelena that Sandro would be released soon. Sandro is then shown being executed and the church is blown up right after.\nDoksopulo alerts Varlam that he has arrested a truckload of people all with the same last name for him, happily saying he'd brought him \"a truck full of enemies.\" At first Varlam snaps to release all of them and apologize and demands for Doksopulo's resignation, before changing his mind and arresting them all after all, allowing Doksopulo to keep his job.\nVarlam's assistant visits Nino and Keti and gives them train tickets, telling her Varlam's men would be coming for them tonight. Moment's after Varlam's assistant leaves, his mom appear and take Nino and Keti.\nIt finally returns to the courtroom where Keti demands Varlam not be buried, for \"to bury him is to bury what he did.\"\nVarlam's grandson, Tornike, has a dream (?) that he's in a concrete enclosure with Varlam where he's threatening to kill the sun, before dying. Abel finds Tornike alone, still seated in the courtroom. He obviously, unlike the rest of his family, believed Keti's story. Him and his father argue over the kind of man Varlam was and Tornike tells Abel he hates him before exiting the room. Tornike is then shown laying in bed that night, while a doctor tells his parents he is in shock. He imagines Varlam laying in a casket as if it were a bed while a woman dances above him.\nIn court they argue over the sanity of Keti and Abel looks pensive. That night he goes into his basement where a crucifix is placed on the wall and asks for a confession from a priest that is pictured eating a raw fish while Abel confesses to him. Abel says he is worried about his faith- the priest responds that Abel is not concerned about good and evil and that it is his fear that is killing him. He admits to being afraid of himself and the kind of person he is. The priest then tells him he's a coward and that if it were up to him he would send Abel straight to hell. Abel get's angry and asks who he is and it's revealed that the priest was Varlam who says \"so you came to confess to the devil?\" and laughs. Abel is viably shaken at court, holding the skeleton of the fish Varlam had been eating. Keti says during court that Varlam continues to live as long as people continue to defend him. Tornike comes to visit her in her cell and asks for her forgiveness. She tells him they're putting her in an insane asylum and he confronts his father about it- they argue and his father slaps him. Tornike proceeds to kill himself in his room. Abel then throws his father's body off of a cliff.\nIt then returns to the kitchen scene from the beginning, and a woman on the street stops and asks Keti through her window is the road leads to a church. Keti replies \"No, this is Varlam Street and it doesn't lead to a church,\" to which the woman replies \"Then what do you need it for?

The youngest, Professor Bertram Potts, is a grammarian played by Gary Cooper. Professor Potts' specialty of research is modern American slang. The professors are accustomed to working in relative seclusion at a leisurely pace with a prim, and rather strict housekeeper, Miss Bragg, keeping watch over them. Miss Bragg is played by Kathleen Howard.", "Their work is being backed by a Miss Totten, played by Mary Field, whose father, Daniel S. Totten, was the original financier of the project.

But before long she becomes genuinely attracted to Bertram, who reciprocates by proposing marriage to her. She avoids giving him an answer because she's agreed to a plan that Joe cooked up to have the professors drive her to New Jersey to marry him.

Reese wasn't there as he'd hoped. Now it's up to Walker to hunt down Reese through his connections. Reese is a top man in the syndicate this time around, so getting to him is not easy. Walker enlists the help of his wife's sister (Angie Dickinson). Since Reese wouldn't give him the cash, Walker disposes of him and move to the next guy in line. The bill gets passed down. Walker simply holds the whole Organization accountable. He won't relent until his gets the money.", "It all comes down to Walker going back to the place that haunts his memory: Alcatraz. That's where his money will be dropped. Once again, an act of treachery is in the works. Walker is set up to be hit by a sniper. He observes the drop-off point from overhead, waits it out, and makes the men believe he didn't show up. At the last moment, all you see is Walker dissipate into the darkness like a ghost. The ending doesn't fill in the blanks. Will he retrieve the money? Has this all been a dream from the beginning when he was left to die? The answers are left up to the viewer."]},

It is revealed that the man is the last of his kind. In Hana's apartment, the two have sex. Hana becomes pregnant, and she gives birth to Yuki, a girl, in their own apartment, delivered by Hana and the man.\nHana becomes pregnant again and gives birth to a baby boy, whose name is Ame, on a rainy day in spring. That same day, the father mysteriously leaves and is found dead in a river while trying to hunt food for the babies.\nHana attempts raising the two children with the little savings left behind by the wolf man, but this becomes a problem when Yuki cannot control switching between her human and wolf form. Hana also attempts to conceal their wolf forms from the people in the city, but, with Yuki, this is also a problem. Yuki becomes very lively while Ame stays by his mother at all times.\nAfter social workers try to check on the children (as they have never had vaccinations), Hana decides she has had enough and moves to the countryside away from prying neighbors.\nLife in the countryside is difficult at first with plants dying within just days after being planted, with the little savings left and with the house in need of repairs.

He keeps his promise to not tell anyone, and Yuki thanks him.\nHana is sleeping in the forest. She has a dream that she visits her wolf man in a field filled with flowers. He tells her that she has raised the children well and that Ame is an adult. In the real world, Ame is carrying Hana to an abandoned parking lot, and it is still raining. Ame sets her down, and Hana wakes up. Hana pleads for him to come back, but Ame refuses, transforming into a wolf. The wolf runs off as Hana watches.

Of course, no one knows why the cruel patriarch and his frigid wife deliberately keep their submissive children in the dark. After all, they say ignorance is bliss--freedom is nothing but a word. But nothing lasts forever. And when corrosive influence in the shape of young security guard Christina enters the equation, sweet, baffling temptation threatens years of meticulous mind-programming.

Early in the morning, Patricia, Jean and Folace give him a present each. Patricia adds a present brought in very early from the Volfoni brothers.

We next see a young teen boy Danny (", ") trying to sleep but can't due to his older brother Derek (", ") and his girlfriend Stacey (", ") having loud sex in the next bedroom. A car drives by with three black men inside. The car stops outside Danny and Derek's house. It then shows Derek is caressing Stacy's naked body, Danny is then slowing turning in his sleep. The three black men slowly get out of their car. One goes over to Derek's truck and the other by his house. The one black man then smashes Derek's truck window awaking Danny. Derek and Stacey are then seen in yet another sexual position, her moaning becoming faster. Danny slowly gets up and peers out from his bedroom window. He sees the man that broke Derek's truck window inside looking around. This startles Danny so he runs into his brother's room to find Stacey riding Derek in the cowgirl position. Danny tells Derek what he witnessed but this startles Stacey and Derek. Derek asks Danny how long the man has been there and if he is strapped, Danny says that he doesn't know. Derek takes a pistol out of a nightstand drawer. He then goes down to the middle of the stairs with Danny following him. Derek tells Danny to stay put. Derek then goes to the door and peers out of the peephole. He then kicks the door in and shoots the one black man twice. The man falls down. The other black man makes a run for it but Derek fires three shots from his gun hitting the man with two of them. The other is uninjured and takes off in Derek's truck. Derek fires multiple shots at the truck breaking the back window. Danny looks down and sees the black man injured from the gunshot wounds. Derek then stars to angrily walk toward him, his arm raised as if to gun whip him.", "In present time, we see Danny is now sitting in the principal's office, waiting to be summoned. As we move into the office, we hear and see Danny's history teacher, Mr. Murray (", "), explaining to the principal, Dr. Robert Sweeney (", "), that Danny wrote a book report on Mein Kampf, Hitler's autobiography that details his anti-Semitic beliefs. Murray tells Dr. Sweeney that he is offended by Danny's gesture and he wants to see him punished. Instead, Sweeney asks Murray to leave and asks Danny to step in. With an American flag toothpick hanging from his mouth, Danny steps into the office and sits down. Dr. Sweeney begins yelling at Danny, telling him that writing what he did is offensive and he only did it because his brother influenced him in that way. Danny argues of course but in the end Sweeney wins and tells him that he is now his new history teacher. The class is called \"American History X\" and the next assignment is due tomorrow morning; a paper on his brother, Derek (", "), who is currently incarcerated. The next scene opens in the school bathroom with three black boys beating up a white boy for telling the teacher that one of them cheated. Suddenly, Danny appears out of one of the stalls and demands that they stop. One boy, Henry, argues with him but Danny simply blows the smoke from his cigarette into his face. The boys leave, Danny helps the white kid from the ground and tells him that he needs to learn to stand up for himself and they leave. Soon we see Danny walking home from school through a park where some black men are playing basketball; one is Henry. We hear Danny begin to narrate the scene and we learn that before Derek went to jail the white kids in the neighborhood didn't have to be afraid of the black kids because Derek made the area safe.", "The next scenes are flashbacks explaining Derek's journey from a suburban white kid to a vengeance-seeking white supremacist. When Danny and Derek were younger, a black drug dealer shot their father, an LA firefighter, while he was doing his job. Soon after that, a middle-aged white supremacist, Cameron Alexander (", "), sought out Derek, hoping to begin a new movement throughout the suburban white youth culture. Cameron convinced Derek that what happened to his father was an act of racism by the black man and it wasn't right and he, or any other white kid, shouldn't be scared. Derek, a natural leader and brilliant orator, began rounding up scared suburban white kids for his new gang and telling them that there was nothing to be afraid of anymore. This new craze became so popular among the kids of Venice Beach that Derek soon became an icon. His legacy started then and continued even throughout the time he spent in jail. The night Derek was arrested, three young Black men were trying to break into his car. Danny hears them and informs his brother. Derek rushed downstairs, gun in hand, and opened the door and began shooting the men. Killing two of the three, Derek then demanded the last man to put his upper teeth on the curb and not move. He then ruthlessly kills him by stomping on the back of his head. Almost immediately after, the police arrive and take Derek away, who submits to them without a fight. As he's handcuffed, Danny sees that Derek has a very telling smile on his face. Later, while Danny attempts to type Sweeney's assignment, he reflects on the fact that if he'd been called into court to testify against his brother, his brother would have been convicted of first degree murder and drawn a much harsher sentence.", "In jail, Derek tries to find a group of people to hang out with as protection from the Hispanic and black prisoners. Not too long after arriving, he finds a group of white supremacists that accept him. As time went by, Derek noticed and starts to realize the compromises men made to stay ahead in the jail - because the supremacists were a minority, they paid a non-white gang to keep them safe. When he learned that a fellow white supremacist was doing favors for a Mexican man, he became enraged and stopped interacting with the group. Later, Derek was assigned laundry duty with a black inmate named Lamont. Lamont was friendly toward Derek, but Derek was not friendly back, at first. Soon Lamont and Derek began to befriend each other and became good acquaintances. Angered that Derek had befriended a black inmate and seemed to be abandoning them, the gang attacks him in the shower, one of them raping him. The day this happened, Dr. Sweeney, who was also Derek's teacher, came to visit him. As soon as he arrived, Derek broke down in tears and told Sweeney that he wanted out and that he wanted to take everything back and move as far away as possible so he wouldn't hurt his family anymore. Dr. Sweeney told Derek that it wasn't enough; Danny was headed down the same path and he must do whatever was necessary for Danny to not end up like him. Derek agreed and told him that he was ready to do anything for his brother once he was out.", "After about three years, Derek is released from prison and returns home to find that Danny has become a white supremacist as well. He also learns that what was once a small following has turned into a considerably large one due to Cameron's influence and Derek's legend. That night, Danny and Derek both go to a party that Cameron is throwing for Derek's homecoming. Once there, he finds his old girlfriend, Stacey (", "), and asks her to move far away with him. He tells her that he doesn't want any of this anymore, he's done with white supremacy. Following that, she asks him if he's crazy and runs off in anger. Derek looks for Danny and finally finds him in Cameron's office. Derek tells Danny to leave and that there is a girl outside waiting for him. After Danny leaves, Derek confronts Cameron and tells him that he's done with the whole white supremacist thing and he knows Cameron's game - Cameron had once rolled over on a couple of his own men and let them go to jail. Cameron is infuriated and they start to argue. The argument ends when Derek punches Cameron in the face and then kicks him again while he's down. Derek leaves and calls for Danny to come with him. On his way out, Seth Ryan (", "), a friend of Derek's before he went to jail, starts yelling at him and demanding an answer as to what happened to Cameron. Derek is befuddled and keeps yelling for Danny but then Seth pulls out a gun and points it at Derek. Stacey begins to yell from the side, \"Shoot him! Shoot him!\" and Seth continues to get closer and closer. Just as Seth is about to do it, Derek grabs the gun and points it up then pushes him and tells him to step away. Derek calls Danny and starts to run away, gun in hand.", "Danny soon catches up to him and Derek begins to explain his life in prison & his change in attitude. Even though Danny is frustrated with Derek, because he's giving up the only thing he thinks brings the white kids hope against the non-white race, he understands and forgives him and they walk home. When they arrive, Danny begins working on his paper and Derek enters the room. They both look at each other and move toward the wall that is covered in white supremacist propaganda; they take everything down. When they're done, Danny returns to the computer to write his paper and Derek gets into the shower. The following morning, at sunrise, Danny is narrator, telling us the end to his story. He says that he's never watched the sunrise before and he hopes that this paper is what he, Dr. Sweeney, is looking for. Derek gets ready for his meeting with his probation officer and soon they leave together. Derek walks Danny to school before his meeting, and on their way they stop at a Café. There, they meet up with Dr. Sweeney and Captain Rasmussen. They tell Derek that Cameron and Seth were found last night after being jumped and they are now in the hospital. Dr. Sweeney and Rasmussen both ask Derek if he knows anything about it and he swears he doesn't. Derek tells them that he has somewhere to go and that he's going to walk Danny to school before he goes. They set off on their way. As Derek is dropping him off, he staggers over words and finally says \"I'll see you at home.\" Danny departs for the front doors and Derek heads down the street. While he's walking, the audience can sense the fear in Derek. At the same time, Danny enters the bathroom just before class starts. What Danny doesn't know is that Henry is in the bathroom as well. He raises a gun and shoots Danny a number of times as blood spatters against the bathroom stall, he falls to the ground lifeless.", "Next we see Derek is in the bathroom with Danny. He sits with him and holds his body close to his, extremely distraught. The only things we can hear between sobs are the remarks Derek is making to himself about what he's done. Immediately after, Danny's voice takes over as narrator and we hear the closing statement of the paper he's written about his brother:", "\"So I guess this is where I tell you what I learned - my conclusion, right? Well, my conclusion is: Hate is baggage. Life's too short to be pissed off all the time. It's just not worth it. Derek says it's always good to end a paper with a quote. He says someone else has already said it best. So if you can't top it, steal from them and go out strong. So I picked a guy I thought you'd like. 'We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies. Though passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds of affection. The mystic chords of memory will swell when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.' \" We see an image of Venice Beach as waves crash over the sunset, then the credits start to roll."]},

Before the party, the Peanuts gang plans to go trick-or-treating; meanwhile, Snoopy, dressed as the WWI flying ace, takes his Halloween persona to extremes. Linus won't be joining them for trick-or-treating or the party: he will be waiting in the local pumpkin patch for the arrival of the Great Pumpkin. Linus believes that the Great Pumpkin rises out of the most sincere pumpkin patch--one more sincere than his own local one--flies into the air, and delivers presents to all the boys and girls around the world. Because of his belief, Linus is the laughingstock among his friends. Sally is torn between going trick-or-treating for the first time and attending Violet's sure-fire fun Halloween party, or following her love Linus and waiting for the Great Pumpkin's arrival with him.", "Lucy and Linus go out one evening to go find a pumpkin for Halloween. At the pumpkin patch, Lucy picks the biggest one, almost as big as Linus, and has him carry it back home. After putting the pumpkin down in some newspapers, Lucy proceeds to carve it. As she scoops out the insides, Linus protests: \"You didn't tell me you were gonna kill it!\"", "Charlie Brown is raking leaves in his yard, while his dog Snoopy helps by blowing the last leaf into the pile. Linus, who is eating an all-day sucker, jumps on the pile, getting leaves stuck all over the sucker and his face. Lucy invites Charlie Brown to kick a football, but he refuses, knowing that she'll just pull it away and watch as he falls flat on his back. Lucy produces a signed document testifying that she won't pull it away, so Charlie Brown takes a running start. She pulls it away anyway, explaining that the document wasn't notarized.", "Linus is writing a letter to the Great Pumpkin, whom he believes rises up from the pumpkin patch on Halloween night to bring presents to all good girls and boys. Everyone who passes by thinks he's wasting his time, except for Sally, who has a crush on him. Undeterred, he finishes the letter and mails it. Charlie Brown comes in with a letter of his own, an invitation to Violet's Halloween party (which Lucy claims was sent to him by mistake). Meanwhile, Linus takes his place at the pumpkin patch to await the Great Pumpkin's arrival.", "On Halloween night, the gang is getting ready to go trick-or-treat. It's Sally's first time, and she's worried that it might not be legal. Lucy is dressed as a witch, claiming that it contrasts with her real personality. Charlie Brown goes as a ghost, but he had trouble with the scissors and cut out too many holes. Even Snoopy is in costume, dressed as a World War I flying ace. The kids go trick-or-treating, passing by the pumpkin patch to mock Linus. They leave, but Sally decides to stay with Linus. Linus assures Sally that the Great Pumpkin will show up, because he picked the most sincere pumpkin patch he could find.", "The kids go door to door asking for candy, with Lucy asking for extra candy for her brother, while Charlie Brown somehow is only given rocks. Meanwhile, Snoopy returns home to act out his WWI fantasies. Sitting atop his Sopwith Camel (his doghouse), he takes to the air and engages the Red Baron in battle. He gets shot down and lands behind enemy lines. Snoopy sneaks around the French countryside, eventually finding refuge in a farmhouse (actually Violet's home).", "After trick-or-treating, the kids all head to Violet's for the party, again passing by the pumpkin patch to make fun of Linus. Sally defends him, but after the kids leave, she demands to know when the Great Pumpkin will arrive. At the party, Charlie Brown is asked to model; he accepts, but then it turns out they just needed the back of his head to draw on it as practice for a jack o'lantern. Lucy plays bobbing for apples, but finds Snoopy hiding inside the tub and is disgusted. Snoopy leans by Schroder's piano as he plays tunes from WWI, then heads back out into the night.", "Back at the pumpkin patch, Linus is telling Sally that the Great Pumpkin will show up soon. Then they hear rustling. A figure rises from the middle of the patch, and Linus is so overcome with emotion he faints. Unfortunately, the figure turns out to be Snoopy, and when Linus comes to, Sally gives him an angry tirade about how he made her miss Halloween, threatening to sue him for restitution. She leaves with the others, as Linus begs them to stay and wait for the Great Pumpkin, but even he is starting to have doubts.", "Linus stays at the pumpkin patch all night, until Lucy gets up in the middle of the night to take him back home. The next day, Charlie Brown and Linus reflect on the night's events. Charlie Brown assures Linus that he's done his share of stupid things too. This upsets Linus, who vows that the Great Pumpkin will appear next year as the credits roll."]},

Living in Paris gives them ample opportunities to expand their horizons as they discuss politics, the arts, and life in general. Jim is something of a ladies' man but Jules isn't so lucky. They soon meet Catherine, a free spirit, and the three of them enjoy life together. She soon agrees to marry Jules but with the arrival of the war the German Jules returns to his home country to serve in the army. Jim serves in the French army and both survive the war. It is a happy day when the two friends are reunited but Jules admits that his marriage has been less than successful and that Catherine has taken many lovers over the years. He loves her very much, however, and will go to any lengths to keep her with him. Jim and Catherine soon become lovers, with Jules' tacit approval, but Catherine's own needs and desires lead to tragedy.", "It's the early twentieth century. Jules, an introspective Austrian, and Jim, an extroverted womanizing Frenchman, form an unlikely friendship when they meet in Paris, it based on the interests and outlook they do share such as writing, although do also embrace their differences. Inexperienced Jules falls for Catherine, a beguiling young woman prone to swings in temperament. While Jules and Catherine date, Jim is openly welcomed into many of their outings, she being a confidante to both of them. Jules and Catherine eventually do marry and have a daughter, Sabine. But an attraction also develops between Jim and Catherine, of which Jules is well aware. Their combined friendship is shown through their meeting, through the Great War where the two men are fighting on opposite sides, and physical separation as Jules, Catherine and Sabine move to rural Rhineland. But each person's relationship with the other two is complicated as it is not only based on their direct feelings for the person in question, but what he/she wants in life, and what the other two want and feel, which is especially important for Jim who has a serious girlfriend named Gilberte to consider as well.", "Paris, 1912. Against the backdrop of the imminent World War I, two bosom friends, Jules, a timid German, and Jim, a Frenchman and a proper ladies' man, enjoy an unclouded, carefree life. But, things will take an unexpected turn after a chance encounter with Catherine, an impulsive and free-spirited Frenchwoman. Before long, unable to resist her effortless charm, the two friends will find themselves at love's command, confronted with the unfathomable manifestations of fate. Now, Catherine's pivotal elements of her behaviour, her ambivalence towards Jules and Jim, as well as her sudden mood swings every time she feels neglected, govern the lives of the best friends. Can love survive the hardships of passion and the inescapable certainty of an impossible liaison?", "The film is set before, during and after the Great War in several different parts of France, Austria, and Germany. Jules (Oskar Werner) is a shy writer from Austria who forges a friendship with the more extroverted Frenchman Jim (Henri Serre). They share an interest in the world of the arts and the Bohemian lifestyle. At a slide show, they become entranced with a bust of a goddess and her serene smile, and travel to see the ancient statue on an island in the Adriatic Sea.", "After encounters with several women, they meet the free-spirited, capricious Catherine (Jeanne Moreau), a doppelgänger for the statue with the serene smile. The three hang out together. Although she begins a relationship with Jules, both men are affected by her presence and her attitude toward life. Jim continues to be involved with Gilberte, usually seeing her apart from the others. A few days before war is declared, Jules and Catherine move to Austria to get married. Both men serve during the war, on the opposing sides; each fears throughout the conflict the potential for facing the other or learning that he might have killed his friend.", "After the wartime separation, Jim visits, and later stays with, Jules and Catherine in their house in the Black Forest. Jules and Catherine by then have a young daughter, Sabine. Jules confides the tensions in their marriage. He tells Jim that Catherine torments and punishes him at times with numerous affairs, and she once left him and Sabine for six months.", "She flirts with and attempts to seduce Jim, who has never forgotten her. Jules, desperate that Catherine might leave him forever, gives his blessing for Jim to marry Catherine so that he may continue to visit them and see her. For a while, the three adults live happily with Sabine in the same chalet in Austria, until tensions between Jim and Catherine arise because of their inability to have a child.", "Jim leaves Catherine and returns to Paris.

The reunion does not occur after Jules writes to tell Jim that Catherine suffered a miscarriage.", "After a time, Jim runs into Jules in Paris. He learns that Jules and Catherine have returned to France. Catherine tries to win Jim back, but he rebuffs her, saying he is going to marry Gilberte. Furious, she pulls a gun on him, but he wrestles it away and flees. He later encounters Jules and Catherine in a famous (at that time) movie theater, the Studio des Ursulines.", "The three of them stop at an outdoor cafe. Catherine asks Jim to get into her car, saying she has something to tell him. She asks Jules to watch them and drives the car off a damaged bridge into the river, killing herself and Jim.

(Jules And Jim Script - Dialogue Transcript)", "The above lines introduce the audience to the movie, immediately followed by the opening credits. The above lines have a very deep meaning, which are manifested as the movie proceeds. Eventually, it can be seen that these have actually summed up the entire film.", "The credits follow, which show shots of the main male leads Jules, Jim and Catherine. For our knowledge the main leads are played by:\nOskar Werner as Jules\nHenri Serre as Jim\nJeanne Moreau as Catherine\nImportantly, Michel Subor as the Narrator", "A first time viewer may not make much sense of the opening dialogs, but, the credits are a treat to watch in itself. There are wide-angled shots of Jules and Jim wiling away their time together, and having fun everywhere. Most scenes here show them having a good time and indulged in activities where they are involved together, like a mock fight or Jules lunging on to Jim.\nThe lovable face of Jeanne Moreau is shown in one of the shots. The scene also introduces us to the supporting cast like Albert and Sabine who have some role to play in the coming events.", "A couple of interesting observations can be made here:\n1.\tThe film actually breaks certain unwritten rules and tries to sum up the story with its opening shot.\n2.\tLike a true path-breaking movie representing the French New Wave era, the credits are filled with images and clips of the actors, involved in interesting activities, something which we have grown to watching at the fag end, in case of other movies. This is a unique way of introducing the characters beyond their screen names.\n3.\tAlso, the entire credit sequence is shot in bright lights, and depicts a very warm and positive mood, in stark contrast to what unfolds in the later scenes.\nAll in all, the scene succeeds in building the right mood and setting a tone for the rest of the film.", "Scene 2: Bonding and Flirting", "The story begins from this scene, and as against the traditional way of introducing each character separately, the movie starts with both Jules and Jim together in the first scene. The lack of history about the male leads is compensated by a sound narration in the background. The entire scene is, in fact, narrated and talks about how the duo meet. Jim actually helps Jules in getting an entry to a ballet performance. As they interact, a friendship blooms, and they are now seen spending most of their time together. Of course, they are chasing girls, with Jim being more successful.\nThe scene towards the end, clearly outlines the chemistry between them. More importantly, it portrays two different characters Jim, as a more convincing and stable guy for relationships as against Jules, who is shy and not the one to create a lasting impression on women.\nAnother notable point is the common interests of the duo in literature, indifference to money and also in women (they go for a threesome as mentioned).", "Scene 3: The Hitch-Hiker", "The scene introduces the first major woman character in the film Teresa (enacted seamlessly by Marie Dubois) Against all accusations of Truffaut showing shades of misogyny, this character actually exudes waves of free living. Teresa is a free radical, and beyond her daylight garb of an anarchist (a somewhat harsh term for a girl who paints the walls of Paris with sarcastic remarks on the incumbent), she actually searches a new shelter (read man) every night. On one such night, she is on a running spree from her accomplice (in painting walls), and meets Jules and Jim. There is an instant chemistry thanks to her cheerful presence. She is happy to meet Jim and Jules, to which Jim corrects with a Jules et Jim. Thus, comes a recall of the movie title in a way the characters would like to put it. The scene also informs of Jim dating Gilberta, making Jules the man to take Teresa to his house.\nThe scene at the house begins with Jules resetting the hourglass and describing it as better than a clock. The entire dialog by Jules can be interpreted metaphorically as his preference to a quiet life or relationship compared to a constant ticking. The scene reinforces the sweet nature of Jules, and is followed by a spectacular performance by Teresa who smokes the cigarette like a steam engine and hops around the room. The scene is really enlightening and on hindsight one can say, its the story of her life, where although she can move places and call it freedom, but, it is always bound by certain boundaries like the tracks of a steam locomotive.", "Scene 4: The elusive Lady Luck", "The opening shot shapes up the character of Jim as a sorted person. True, he is dating a girl, but, he leaves for the day even after her insistence, because, he firmly believes in letting the relationship thrive over time before going for something like a Live-in with Gilberta.\nThe next shot is of Jules, Jim and Teresa at an eating table, where Teresa suddenly deserts their company to get in conversation with another man. Her style is the same as Jules experienced the other night and something which disappoints Jules again. Jim does console him, only to watch Jules reminiscing his past girlfriends, and showing their photographs. Jules also chalks out a face on the table of his past love, which Jim attempts to buy from the hotel owner. This goes to show the camaraderie between the two and the way, they attach importance to each others emotions.\nA clear contrast can be seen here between Jules and Jim wrt relationships. Jules is sweet, shy and somehow very obvious in his keenness to have partners, whereas, Jim is more thoughtful, patient and never outrightly judgmental for a girl, as in the case of Gilberta.\nNotably, Teresa is the first instance of a free spirit, and her tendency to move on from staying at one place, to another every night is not just about finding a new shelter every night, but, is more about referring to the aspiration of moving on from one partner to another, and leading life on terms. Maybe, she doesnt influence the society much as an activist of anarchy, but, she does have elements of anarchy in her own life.", "Scene 5: Finding the purpose of their lives", "Its a new day, when the duo meet Jules friend Albert. Albert is showing them a slideshow of pictures of different statues. The reason why they go for this isnt known. The description here by Jules for Albert is very interesting He knows all those", "who'll be famous in years (Jules And Jim Script - Dialogue Transcript)\nThese lines can double up to also mean that Albert is the person who now knows Jules and Jim well, and these are the characters who are famous even today. Probably, a far-fetched idea, but, these lines exude the directors confidence in the plot, knowing already that these characters will become evergreen in the memories of the viewer in times to come.\nAlbert takes them through many photographs of statues he had clicked in different places, and suddenly Jules and Jim are struck by the Eureka moment. Jim requests for a particular photo to be seen again.\nThis was the photo of a not-so-smooth finish sculpture of a woman with a very calm and enlightening smile. The peace this photo exuded, made Jules and Jim get hooked to it, and they pay a visit to the actual sculpture, which was displayed in an open-air museum at an Adriatic island. The scene enters into narration mode, and the soothing voice of Subor, does add intensity to the scene. The scene has our duo dressed alike, which goes to show either their homoerotic feelings for each other, which might sound clichéd, or rather their simple thought process of having fallen for the same smile. Jules and Jim spend the entire day sitting beside the statue and even after returning they seem to have a scarcity of words for what they had witnessed.\nThey instantly decided that such a smile was rare, and if they ever found a woman with one, they would pursue it. These last lines mean very simply that if such a woman were to be found, both of them would definitely try to love her, which probably forms a backdrop for the rest of the movie, where they end up loving the same woman.", "Scene 6: Think of the Angel, and you be blessed with one", "Perhaps, one of the most critical scenes in the movie.\nIt starts with Jules and Jim practising in a gym, when, Jim narrates excerpts from a book that he is writing. Autobiographical in nature, the novel is about Jim and Jules as Jack and Julian. It descirbes their friendship as queer, which in todays times is considered a derogatory way of addressing homosexuals. Jim actually cites these considering the time the duo spend together, and the concern and love they have for each other. Jules, also likes the work and offers to translate the same in German.\nThis is the scene where the movie has tried to show Jules and Jim in the light of being a couple, but, in a very subtle manner. So, the viewer can either assume this to be true considering that direct representation of a same sex relationship in those days would have been a taboo.\nElse, some critics consider this argument far-fetched and that the relationship is merely platonic.\nAny which way, one cannot stop wondering about this, also considering that this movie is based on a novel by Henri-Pierre Roche who was known to have experienced some relationship of this kind.\nA better way of explaining this is that Jim is writing an autobiographical novel, which can be a tribute to Roche, and whether or not Truffaut wishes to clarify on the relationship of Jules and Jim, we already now from the life of Roche, that there were homoerotic feelings between him and his friend, which inspired his autobiographical novel.\nAnyway, the film so far keep us under the impression of the duo being a couple, in spite of their following the opposite sex.\nThis is followed by a shower sequence, where Jules talks about 3 girls (French, Belgian and Dutch), invited for dinner.\nThis is where, we witness the next from the appearance of Catherine (couldnt have been a better choice than Jeanne Moreau).\nThe entire sequence has a very angelic feel to it, with Catherine shown to be walking down the stairs, almost like an angel, something which is a common feature in modern day Bollywood movies, where the entry sequence of the female protagonist is dramatized to the extent of showing her as the Goddess of beauty and poise.\nJules and Jim witness a near dream Catherine is THE one. The woman they would pursue, because she has that enigmatic smile.\nJules suggests no formalities during the party, and a touching of toes against the customary linking of arms. Probably, abolishing usage of formal addresses for each other is supposed to make the guest be at comfort with the entire party.\nThe linking of toes is a contrast of sorts. The first impression it gives to the audience is that Jules is shying away, Jim is eager and Catherine is undecided. Further analysis of scenes will tell us if this is how the plot will unfold.", "Scene 7: The race begins", "Jules was head on heels after the coveted smile and the Lady herself. Catherine had an aura about herself, and Jules wasted no time in pursuing his dream girl.\nFor almost a month, Jules was seeing Catherine, and used to meet Jim at the gym.\nJust as a logical extension to their friendship, Jim is invited by Jules to meet Catherine, who is eager to meet Jim, having heard a lot from Jules.\nJules wants Jim to meet her, but, stay away from seeing her the other way.\nThey meet pretty formally, and the plan is of an outing. Truffauts brilliance comes out in this scene as he blasts the stigma against a woman venturing out with two men.\nTo overcome this situation, Catherine puts up a moustache, lights a cigar and leaves with the duo. His scene holds special importance, considering how a sweet friendship with two men, still needs to be concealed from the society. Truly, one can connect with such a situation around us, when a guy roaming about with two girls is a stud and a girl doing the same in the converse is a slut.\nCatherine finds it a lot more fun to see a man referring to her as Sir, and taking help to light his smoke. This scene sends the message that with a certain get-up, a woman can find her way in a patriarchal society. On the other hand, from Catherines perspective it is the sense of freedom from such social stigmas, and that a certain way an attitude of life can actually make men bow before you.\nJules and Jim are really enjoying this outing, wondering if tit is a dream or is it actually raining. More so, each of them is captivated by the lady, and are simply following her.\nThe very next scene is even more remarkable, where the trio plan to race on a bridge, and Catherine takes a false start before the count ends to win the race. Although she cheated, she makes a point with how just having an advantage initially, males dominated the society, and given an opportunity women can be more than an equal. It also symbolises the essence of the entire film, where pursuing the same woman with that enigmatic smile is the purpose of the lives of Jules and Jim. In fact, this scene beautifully captures all these aspects together, and similar to the opening dialogues of the film, it actually captures the gist of the whole film.\nAfter the race, Jules talks to Jim about Catherines background importantly mentioning that she teaches Shakespeare. Well, this takes us back to the scene with Teresa and the duo, where Jules was talking about Shakespeare. Clearly, love for Jules would mean those enigmatic smiles followed by a Shakaespearean connect.\nThe scene ends with Jim agreeing to pick up Catherin from her house for the station. This is, as the trio would be travelling some place the next day. It cannot be known, the reason why Catherine asked for Jim to do the honors and not her date Jules.", "Scene 8: Jimmy me", "Jim arrives at Catherines place, and it unusual pack-up for her, when she does an unusual thing. She starts burning many letters, and tells Jim that she is burning lies. She obviously is heart-broken with some past relationships, and thinks its best to flush them out of her memory lane before leaving for the trip.\nHer gown catches fire in the process, and Jim helps her out. The previous frame shows her frock quite away from the fire, but, it catches fire in the very next instant. This goes to show probably, about future possibilities of Cats misdemeanours which will be cleaned up by Jim. Although, a very ridiculous thought, this is how the erstwhile society would have perceived the character of Catherine and the reaction of Jim throughout the movie.\nCat is also seen packing a bottle of sulphuric acid with her. She keeps it to punish men who lie. The aggressive heart burnt side of Cat comes out in the open. Jim persuades her to drain out the same, and, eventually the duo leave for the station.", "Scene 9: Threes a crowd!", "The trio rent a house somewhere far way from Paris on a coast. After a good nights sleep, they leave for the beach. They go on a random scavenger hunt and find cigarette butts and bottles, left by past travellers. Just, when Catherine utters I think we are lost, is when Jules discusses with Jim about planning to marry Catherine. I think the connect is signifying the lack of clarity in the relationships the tri share with each other.\nJim, at this point believes that Catherine is not meant to be a doting wife, who would be content leading a life with her husband and children. He describes her as above the earthly laws and an apparition. Clearly, this is a contrast as Catherine, as a woman is definitely one of a kind, who is like a free radical, whereas as Jules and Jim are more like men bound by the patriarchal thinking of the society.\nJules adamant for a frank opinion from Jim, which is what goes to show how enamored Jules is with the lady, but, how at the back of their minds both Jules and Jim know the eccentricity of Catherine is boundless.\nAll in all, society teaches us to seek stability from a relationship, whereas, Cat believes in the personal freedom and unpredictability that should guide here relationships.\nCatherine also talks about the thoughts from a German book, where the lines say what Catherine really believes in -", "The sky we see...", "is a bubble no bigger than this", "We walk with our heads", "pointed at the center", "What's beyond the crust?", "Who knows? That's not a question", "for gentlemen to answer (Jules And Jim Script - Dialogue Transcript)\nThese lines clearly outline Catherines thinking of life. The whole idea of these lines is how the society has made us into believing into its established rules, and we keep coming back to it, never daring to think, if something beyond all this is possible too.\nA few shots back, Jim had conveyed similar thoughts about Catherine.\nThe entire scene makes us know a lot more about Catherine, and also wonder as to who understands her better Jules or rather Jim?", "The scene ends with Jules reminding Cat of his proposition of marriage and requests for an answer by the next day.\nJules and Jim are now shown playing Dominos and are quite engrossed in the game with each other. So much so, that they almost ignore the presence of Catherine. Another instance of her aggressive nature emerges, as she attempts to draw attention to her by narrating tales weird and funny.\nFirst, she recounts her childhood fantasy of meeting Napolean in a lift and getting pregnant with his child. Interestingly, the original book describes this as a dream of Catherine. This tells us something about her nature. She then recites a pretty sad joke, and then laughs about it. She wants someone to scratch her back for her, to which Jules responds with a funny one liner. Cat walks to him and slaps him, to which they all have a hearty laugh. To think about this, it is a moment showing how Catherine would rather live every moment of life in free will, and being spontaneous and how Jules and Jim would play a reactive role here.\nCatherine actually admits of never having laughed like this before, and the fluent actress Jeanne Moreau comes up with sad faces to describe herself before meeting the duo.", "Well, she believes those those are past her, and now she is blissful. It rains the next day, and Cat wishes to go back to Paris. The scene really shows here capriciousness and spontaneity of taking decisions, and also of how Jim and Jules flow suit, without a reaction at all.\nIt is one thing to be a free bird in a patriarchal society, and a complete elevation to have people like Jim and Jules with you who aid you in leading that ideal life.\nThe scene ends, and our trio are now back in Paris.", "Scene 10: The leap of fate'", "Jim has just signed with his publisher, and as a celebration comes to Jules and Cat with gifts. He presents a beautiful Picasso work to the duo, and gifts a little hand (a stick) to Cat for scratching her back. A small gesture indicative of the previous scene at the island. Jim also has tickets for a Swedish play at night. The scene moves on to the inauguration of a bed for Jules, meant to be for the couple, and communicating the joys of being settled together.\nThe next frame moves on to the finish of play, and the trio discussing it on the way back. This is actually a quality of the film, where the story moves on very quickly from on frame to another, without bothering for the usual slower shots, and going into details which can at best link the story, but, play no role in talking about the main theme. Truffaut has taken maximum care about managing maximum footage with the protagonists. Anyway, we now find the trio discussing the movie on the way back. The play was about a woman, who is as free-spirited as Cat herself. No wonder, she liked the character a lot. Jim, on the other hand, found the play pretty divergent, and didnt agree for the usage of vice to justify virtue.\nDiscussing the play, really, brings out the male stigma about importance attached to virginity of a woman, which in fact, is a way to judge her dignity. The plot of the play, was about an impotent man (with a homo brother) all usual social taboos. Hence, Jim and Jules were worried more about the virginity of his wife, rather than her take on life. Jules enters the debate and advocates for the fidelity of a wife. He believes fidelity is secondary for men, and that as written in previous scriptures, thoughts advocated by Baudelaire all point towards the bitchiness of women, and Jules utters many more words against womanhood in general. Catherine, obviously takes offence to these remarks, and more so because wrt her life, she really believes and associates with the protagonist of the play. Jim, probably is sane enough to realise this and doesnt seem to support Jules; ranting against women.\nThis is perhaps a very dominant feature in Truffauts movies. The message he wants to send with Cats character is resonated through other female characters of the movie too like Teresa and this protagonist of the Swedish play. Catherine is not the one to let it go, and she decides to protest against Jules remarks. She believes in making a statement and walks ahead and suddenly jumps into the Seine river.\nAbout the shot taken, it involved usage of two cameras (to capture her fall realistically and interestingly, as the body double was too high before the scene, Jeanne Moreau herself enacted this shot).\nSubors voice over takes over the scene and rightly so, as the act of Catherine is too amazing to be wasted with dialogues.\nJules is shell shocked, Catherine wears the smile of a victorious general, and Jim, on the other hand is filled with admiration for the lady. So far, Jules is the one who has been clear with his love for Catherine, whilst Jim has been a secret admirer. He actually painted the jump of at in his mind, and imagined diving into the river and saving her. Its a way of enacting in the mind, something which cannot be done actually, considering she was Jules.\nThe trio take a cab back home, and Cat asks Jim for a small meeting the next day. This is supposedly to take his opinion on their marriage. Jim agrees and walks back after what can easily be an eventful day, when they witnessed the lady of their dreams in her fullest form.", "Scene 11: The mis(s)led rendezvous", "Jim arrives at the café at 7:10 as decided, only about 10 minutes late. The deliberate delay can be described as a mentality of not being present at a meet before the woman. There is a small dialogue of some other customer, whilst Jim is shown immersed in rounds of coffee and smoking. This other customer is the actor Jean-Louis Richard, ex of Jeanne Moreau, speaking like a true heart burnt soul. Audience of that era would have connected with this short sequence more, knowing about the divorced couple.Catherine never does arrive at the café, and one thing can be said about this. Maybe, Jim would always have asked Catherine to stay away from the relationship. He was the one who read her very well, and knew that Jules cannot handle her as a wife. He was sure of Cat being a free spirit, and someone not suited enough for men of a patriarchal society. Maybe, Catherine guessed Jims opinion too, and probably gave the meeting a miss. For some reason, Jim actually missed her.\nThe next scene is a telephonic conversation between Jules and Jim, where Jules talks about Cats approval and their marriage plans. He says, Cat arrived at the café, but pretty late. Not much is said about this missed rendezvous. The friends talk on phone, not knowing that it will be sometime before they meet again, with the First World War beginning, and France and Germany coming at loggerheads. Interestingly, when Jim makes fun of Jules French and his Austrian accent, Jules recites a few lines, which seem like the words of a general for his forces to eliminate the enemy. Little do they know, that this will be an event in their lives pretty soon.", "Scene 12: Love proposes, war disposes", "The war footage is shown from the archives, and is deliberately a shortened clip, in true Truffaut style of not deviating away from the premise of the film. As usual it shows devastation, depicts hideousness and the difference in war and peace.\nJeanne Moreau has quoted in an interview:\nFiction is as valid as reality, only better.\nA true summation of how war is to the affected, and to those who experience it only as news or through virtual games.\nThe scene also shows Jims longing for a furlough, which never comes. What comes regularly is packages from Gilberta. Gilberta still is the epitome of an ideal woman prescribed by the society. Jim does get a chance to be in Paris for a week and in meeting with Gilberta, they discuss a possible marriage.\nGilberta does understand Jim, and doesnt force for a marriage. They think about growing old together, something, which signifies a live-in relationship, and not the whirlwind. Jim is worried about the chance happening of meeting Jules at the front, something which will be the worst scenario of having to kill your best pal.", "Scene 13: Jule(s) of thought", "Jules keep writing to Catherine. He pens down his thoughts for her, not knowing if these letters could ever be posted. His feelings for Cat are at best sexual, and also about concerns for the soon to be born. His relationship appears more transactional.\nKnowing Catherine, it is surprising that Jules still considers her as the socially prescribed woman.\nAnyway, Jules is too happy to be posted on the Russian front. Although dangerous, he prefers it any day to killing Jim, had they met on the French front.\nFinally, the war clouds subside and Jules and Jim are able to correspond through letters again. Jim expresses his desire to marry too, and Jules invites him to his location (somewhere along the Rhine river), to witness the married life and judge for himself.\nJim takes this as an opportunity, and travels to other places on his way to witness the fall-outs of the war. He witnesses mass graves, and the way war has changed demographics for ever. He also writes articles on these for a Parisian daily.\nJules, on the other hand is leading a married life and they have a daughter Sabine.", "Scene 14: What lies beneath", "Catherine has come with Sabine to receive Jim. Her dressing makes Jim think, if she is compensating for the miss at the café. They walk through the pines and meadows and reach their chalet. Jim and Jules finally meet after what seemed like eternity.\nThey inquire about the others and exchange hugs. They retort of each one not having changed much.\nIn this scene, the music suddenly changes to a more melancholy one, something which is not present in the rest of the film. It signifies of a possible twist, and something really unprecedented is waiting to happen.\nThe rest of the scene is about a lunch, some chatting about each others lives and taking Jim around the house.\nJules is currently scripting for a novel on dragon flies. He has taken a liking to insects and plants, and even quit smoking. Not much happens in the scene anyway, and the usual chemistry between Jim and Jules is absent. All in all, the scene is more of a context setting for the rest of Jims stay and we can only guess, as to what will be unearthed later.", "Scene 15: She loves me, She loves me not", "Jim was supposed to be living at a house close to their chalet. In his conversations with Jules, he figured something wrong in their relationship. At night, he sits with Jim in his room, and tell it all. He describes how Catherine is a good wife and a mother, but, is too prone to getting off with a monotonous life. Jim is surprised, but Jules goes on with her past escapades, and her leaving home for about six months. Then, there is the return of Albert, who is recovering in a nearby village and his love for Catherine. He has fallen for her, wishes to marry her and take care of Sabine.\nJules has slowly begun to accept the fact, that he isnt the one for Catherine and is preparing himself for leaving her. Jim, on the other hand, feels that Jules Buddhist monkish personality will never let Cat leave him completely.\nAlthough, the cat is definitely out of the bag, and Jim probably had figured it this way long back. The scene ends, on a dark night, and the next shot of twilight is also full of dark shades, showing Truffauts way of expressing the mood through nature.", "Scene 16: Cat(ch) me if you can", "Jim wakes up to a dawn, which he knows will rule the days to come with its foggy darkness. Jim spends time thinking of Jules revelations, and believes that Jules is wrong. He knopws Jules in and out, and also for a fact, that his sweetness isnt enough for Cat. He appreciates Jules frankness and soft stand on the near separation wth Cat.\nReally, it is the persistent feeling of Jules, that he is not the right man for Cat, that is causing these troubles. Jules still is a believer of the one-woman man and vice-versa concept, and this is what is stifling his relationship with Cat.\nOn the other hand, Cat is a woman, who would leap into relationships just like she had jumped into the seine, and its part of her nature to be spontaneous about partners.\nOn a particular night, Cat wishes to have a conversation with Jim.\nIn her typical style, she asks him to pursue her, and they go into the woods.\nThe conversation starts with a tell-all tale from Jim, where the movie so far is recounted. Jim confesses to missing Cat at the café.\nHe also feels no particular resentment towards Cat, at least not more than Jules himself.\nCat now gives her side of the story. She believes Jules is a sweetheart, but, only so much to it. The traits of Jules which she found attractive like his vulnerability, and hoped to heal them with her love, is what she found out were inseparable from Jules. Catherine as a woman, hates a status quo in a relationship, and couldnt stand the marriage for log. She also describes her escapades, and believes its always important to always settle the scores before starting it afresh. All this goes on, and Jim can only listen to what Catherine as a woman, is always likely to do. She is the real woman and will always have her bit to do in a relationship. She believes, her part with Jules is over, and they can never be together.\nThe entire conversation lasts till dawn, and the dim light sequence only emphasizes on the phase of life each character is going through.\nThe scene ends with Jim left thinking, if Catherine was actually hitting on him or was it just what he really wanted.", "Scene 17: Loves never blind, lovers are", "Albert pays a visit to the household. They discuss like old friends on reunion. Truffauts portrayal might baffle many, but its true that there cannot be the expected fireworks between Jules and Albert, now that Jules has accepted his fate.\nHey discuss war, and Jim recounts the story of a soldier, who pursued his individual battle alongside the war. So much so, that he literally ived the process of love, love making and marriage through letters, and did it well.\nJust to say, that a one-way communication in a relationship, can always survive, and probably it is the staying together and reacting to each other part that makes an actual relationship, seem like a corpse on the shoulders. This is also true with Jules, who had a great life with Catherine, when they corresponded through letters. Truffaut emphasizes the importance of an epistolic relationship, and how it actually aids in keeping the two sides happy. Jims narration of this story is actually a tribute to Apollinnair.\nThe scene ends, with Cat and Albert taking leave for practising on a song. I believe, here Jeanne Moreaus views are relevant, when she says:\nA triangular relationship is never fusional. It works because each of them is like a pole, absorbed into oneself, and seeking something from each partner. Here, is an example of a love triangle, not for the common love, but, also a lot of love for each other as well.", "Scene 18: Even apart, we often meet again", "This scene is where a beautiful song is played. Sung by Catherine, and strings strummed by albert, it beautifully describes, the initial loves bonding between Cat and Jules, and how it all went haywire. But, that want to be the end, and the couple gather their lives and live them on a new plane. It does seem like, a message from Cat to Jules. The song is meant to be sung by a man, and it appears beautiful, when certain lines arent translated, but, simply recited, adding to the beautiful mood created in the room.\nIt is obligatory to quote this beautiful song, just for the simple way in which it describes the relationships from a writers point of view", "She had rings on every finger Bracelets on her wrists", "And she sang with a voice\nWhich bewitched me", "We met with a kiss\nA hit - then a miss", "lt wasn't all bliss, but we started.\nThen we went our own ways", "We each went back\ninto the hustle and bustle of life", "l saw her again one night\nlt's been such a long time... (Jules And Jim Script - Dialogue Transcript)", "Scene 19: A magnet for all poles", "The first few lines of this scene describe Catherine as a different person for each of Jules, Jim and Albert.\nThis actually means, that cat is seeking a different level of relationship with each of them. She is unable to find all of friendship, love and sensual needs from one man. So, she goes out to seek each of these desires with a different partner, and is absolutely justified considering that she truly believes in living life on her own terms.\nThe shot of the entire family with Jim and Albert cycling across the road was a new method then. Truffaut can be credited to have creatively captured the moving image from an approaching cyclists point of view, by the camera itself placed on another cycle.\nThis is followed by a scene describing the newly formed affinity between Jim and Catherine. They talk about it in a room, and exchange their views on it. Jim is slightly hesitant, although he already knows he loves Cat, whereas, Cat is more about taking the plunge, being an adventurous woman that she is.\nI can only describe this as a metaphorical hypothetical question and attempt to answer it too Is the contrast between the film and life between time, something that is painful and wont last?\nAn instant is powerful, but, it cant last. And love, is caught between the two.\nJules feels that Cat is full of desires and curiosity. The free life of cat is not an enigma, its her way of living, just that it is cruel to others.\nThen, comes the scene where the two get close just below the chalet, and Jules witnesses it above.\nNoises were generated in many circles, about a husband being a silent observer to his wifes liberties. But, this is about approving to the whims of Cat, and probably the last attempt in having her around, though painfully with his best pal. They discuss the exchange of a book Elected Affinties which sums up the preferences Catherine has and the level of relationship she wishes to have with different men.", "Scene 20: A new wave", "In this scene, Jules calls up Jim for the book, but it is more for convincing him to marry Catherine.\nThe reason, presumably is that he knows he cant hold on to the sand that is Cat, and yet, he wants her to be preserved in a way or another. He finds it best for Jim to marry her, and start it all afresh.\nNow is time for Jim to movie in. Cat shows him the room, and begins a scene of love-making.\nTruffaut disliked intimate love scenes and instead focuses more on shadows and the gestures of pulling the hair, to describe the passionate moments.\nWith the new relationship canvas drawn, Jules also warns Jim of Cat and also from himself.\nThe entire romantic angles, somehow now seem like vultures hovering over threateningly and seem more destructive.\nThen, comes a day when Catherine indulges with Jules, seduces him. The entire seen is like a game that Cat plays and can be viewed as a womans desire to rape a man. Rape is simply not physical, but, also about controlling the opposite during the act, and Cat as it appears is controlling the entire act.\nReally, she herself said, You only truly love once, but happens to fall in love again and again. It shouldnt be viewed from the scope of morality, but from the spectacles of following ones desires and the not the rules.\nIts better to be imposing yourself, rather than being imposed upon by some obsolete rules of the society.", "Scene 21: What goes around.comes around", "The scene is of the trio going for a walk around a misty lake surrounded by a valley. They seem to be in peace, and try skipping stones on the water.\nThis scene without dialogs is signifying the dark haze gathering around the relationship of Jim and Catherine, especially after her seduction attempt on Jules.\nWith the darker shades, and a not so happy looking nature, one can clearly guess the turn of events in their lives.", "Scene 22: Done for good", "Jim leaves for Paris on a call from his newspaper. He bids a warm goodbye, with promises of coming back and having children with Cat. However, the underlying part of this scene is more to show that trouble maybe just around the corner for the couple. The metaphorical sequence of a train leaving from right to left is always a sign of something opposite to happen in the lives of people.\nJim, back in Paris confesses to Gilberta of his marriage plans, which obviously has her heartbroken.\nFollowing which, he meets several of his acquaintances at the hotel, all of whom certainly inquire about Jim.\nIn the films context, this is a way of saying that with all that Jim has done at Jules place, he needs to ask this to himself: Hows Jules?\nJim also runs against Teresa, the smoking engine, who has an influencing 2 minute chatter with Jim. In this, she describes all her past flings and experiences, and finally that of settling with one man. This explains why, Teresa can be no match to Catherines eccentricity because she finally settles with one man after all her soul searching. So, it means if a man can restrict a woman with just one desire and satisfy it again and again he can have the girl for ever.\nJim plans to go back, but is stopped by Gilberta. She pleads him to stay back for a week citing that he will have Catherine for a lifetime now.\nJim writes back saying he has certain farewells to accomplish. This sparks some trouble in Cats mind, if he truly loves her.\nAll in all, Jims trip back to Paris only sparks unrest in the relationship, and further scenes can supposedly be reactionary.", "Scene 23: Back to square one", "This is a scene where Jules and Jim are together for the first time in the absence of Catherine. They end up discussing her a lot, and with Catherine gone away for a while, like before, Jim decides to return to Paris, away from this entire muddle.\nJim is surprised to find Jules receiving him at the station and not Catherine. On reaching back to the chalet, he finds that Catherine has taken her small sabbatical yet again. Jim and Jules end up discussing her.\nFor the first time, it seems that he understands her. He calls her the real woman, full of desires and whims. He believes, that is the reason they love her so much, and because of this love, Catherine truly feels like a queen between them. This probably explains the affinity of each of them with the other two, and why they stick around in spite of their misgivings towards each other from time to time. Jim, however, wishes not to go through what Jules faced, and wishes to leave immediately. Jules agrees to play along, when Catherine suddenly bumps in from the window. This shot signifies the free radical nature of Catherine. She left home like a free bird, in an attempt to settle scores when she realised that Jim would stay back to bid farewell to his people. Usually, we find women ranting and getting depressed about all this, instead, Catherine believes in letting herself loose, and finding someone who would suit her state of mind for that time.\nScene 24: Paradise Lost?", "Jim soon gets to know from Catherine of her recent escapade. It is her way of balancing things. She knew, Jims delay was to stay with Gilberta, and she had her own time to neutralise things. This was Catherines way of living.\nOur patriarchal society will never agree to this, and brand her as a slut and what not. But, isnt the logic simple, if you are ready to occupy equal positions in a relationship, rather than dominate it as per the society?\nCatherine did to Jim, what he tried to do and hoped to escape. It is justified of Catherine to do so, and free herself of any angst, and at the same time remove an guilt from Jims end.\nA way of starting the relationship from scratch rather than living with the thought of having a mate who is shared.\nThis treatment shatters Jim, but, overnight he gets the message, and being mutually in love, they take the relationship forward.\nThey remain chaste form some time to ensure that the Cat isnt pregnant from her recent act, and then start trying. Somehow, Cat doesnt conceive and the couple is found visiting doctors to identify the problem.\nThe entire scene keeps up with the personality of Catherine, and although has startled audiences over generations, it delivers the simple message of gender equality very effectively. On one hand, we have Gilberta as a woman who faces angst and depression on account of losing out to Jim, and is ready to wait forever, even with the fact of sharing him with Catherine. This is nothing but a society sponsored definition of love, and actually a compromise.\nCatherine stands against this system, and fights for herself. Remarkably, she fights this way for herself, and not as an activist, signifying how each woman must do this in her life to overcome the bias, and not wait for a feminist movement to remove this social discord.", "Scene 25: The OR deal", "Jim and Catherine are no longer a happy couple. They still love each, at least Jim does, but two things make Catherine feel sick about everything 1.\tShe is tired of waiting to have a child, which probably will never come.\n2.\tJim is still in touch with Gilberta, and she cannot stand his ambivalent state of mind, something she has gone through.\nClearly, men cannot agree to sharing their woman sexually, whereas, women cannot stand sharing their man on an emotional level.\nTheir quarrel makes Jim decide for a temporary break-up of 3 months, and they will reunite if they are still in love.\nCatherines dialogue at this juncture is important:\nAre you in pain?", "Not me, not anymore.", "Because we mustn't suffer...not at the same time", "Once you stop suffering, l'll suffer (Jules And Jim Script - Dialogue Transcript)", "Catherine actually enjoys this situation and believes her time of suffering might come too if she is to really miss Jim in coming days.\nShe walks into Jules room, and they have a very emotional conversation. Probably, for the first time in the movie, Cat opens her heart out to Jules. Jules supports her really well, smokes a cigarette after a long time, and assures Catherine of Jims honesty and his own love for her.\nWait, we suddenly realise that Jim alone isnt ambivalent. During their heart rending conversation, Jules pledges his love for Cat, to which she responds:\nI love you too\nThis might be considered as a usual retort to I love you in todays times, but is actually used for saying, that apart from Jim, I love you too.\nThus ends the scene with Jim leaving for Paris, and Jules role being to be alongside Cat, something he attaches a lot of importance to.", "Scene 26: Counterbalance", "Cat and Jim leave for the station. On this foggy day, train is rescheduled, and they book a hotel for the day. The entire day is spent without a word being exchanged. Jim, in his thoughts thinks about what could /couldnt have happened/happen.\nCatherine scrubbing her face is a treat to watch, as if clearing her conscience of what has gone by.\nTruffauts brilliance makes this scene memorable. It could have been passed of as a lewd scene with some love-making, but, instead he chooses to show the maturity in their relationship and signs off.\nJim leaves, and the train leaving from right to left is a sign of things going in a downwards spiral.", "Scene 27: Amores Perros", "Jim is back in Paris and very ill. Gilberta takes care of him, and he is back in an epistolic relationship with Catherine. They exchange letters, where Cat wants him back as she is pregnant. Jim, is ill and doubts if Cat speaks the truth. Anyway, he finds it disgusting to think of the child, if it really is coming, belonging to Albert.\nHe sends a stern reply, till he finds an emotionally loaded letter, talking about the soon-to-be born, the emotions of Cat flowing across the letter. The woman he loves, is pregnant and this solves all their past issues. Jim decides to rush to Voges this time.\nOne thing is clear from the scene, that women although cheated upon everywhere, are less insecure compared to men. They are scary to some extent, and their insecurity of sharing their girl with someone else, transcends all boundaries.\nAlso, just when Jim decides to come back, he receives a message that the child has died in pre-natal stage. He thinks that Catherines way of trying to redefine the rules of life (read society), have actually killed the seed of life. It is now about staying away, and leading their own lives with Jules and Gilberta respectively.", "Scene 28: Str(i)angulation", "Jim bumps into Jules by chance in Paris. Jules and Catherine have moved to Paris. They plan to meet at Jules place. Catherine now owns a car. The trio set out for eating out, and bump into Albert at the restaurant. Entire co-incidental scene appears too good to be true. They have food together, and Catherine decides to stay back with Albert for the night.\nJules and Jim discuss about Catherine. She now wields a gun, and has been showing suicidal tendencies of late. Jules now seems to be a better man, with his experience in this relationship. He now shows the maturity, earlier only Jim could have shown. He understands Catherine better than Jim.\nJules acknowledges Jims decision to marry Gilberta, as he has moved on at the right time. Jim asserts its because, once its over with Cat, its truly over.\nSomething that Jules also had experienced before. The entire shot of the trio together is full of tension and the interactions are formal and solemn. Catsmotto has always been: For a couple, atleast one has to always be faithful, namely the other. These words artistically sum up her character.", "Scene 29: Not with you, Not without you", "Catherine literally stalks Jim, at his place with her car, honking the horn and driving around curves in the out. If the car is assumed to represent her, then this driving describes her rendezvous with the different men in her life, and the way she has moved on from one relationship to another.\nShe then calls upon Jim, and they have a small conversation here. Cat wants him back, but Jim refuses saying he will be marrying Gilberta. The entire argument moves to how Catherine has tried to explore love, but as a pioneer she wasnt humble, but, egocentric instead. This has created a mess in the lives of Jules, Gilberta and many more.\nTheir discussion throws light on Truffauts attempted message throughout the film. For the first time, he explicitly sends his message through the words of Jim.\nJim agrees to the curiosity that everyone has about love. This is something beyond the boundaries of society. He also appreciates Cats motive of discovering love beyond social stigma, which is hypocrisy at best anyway. Cats principle of love and couple not matching up is also highlighted. But, Jim believes that one always has to move on in life, and that this curiosity of being a rebel has to be curbed when trying to find love with someone.\nClearly, Catherine who can be an inspiration to men and women alike wrt her take on love, messes up here start by not trying to control her curiosity even once. Her line-up of relationships, have to get complicated and probably impossible, if someone from the partners turns up to be like her. Hence, when Jim became ambivalent like her, and literally started two-timing, Catherine couldnt bear the taste of her own medicine. No wonder then that an entire effort in a new direction fell apart. Cat cannot take this reality anymore and attempts to shot at Jim. He somehow escapes, and their equation is all but over.\nTruffaut believes in repeating a point thrice in the movie to make it stay with the audience, and hence, the free spirited life of Catherine is demonstrated thrice through Teresa, Catherine herself and the plays and finally though the words of Jim.\nLeft with no other option, Jim now resigns himself to the institution of marriage. Eventually, everyone finds himself/herself back to following social norms.", "Scene 30: Alls well, when the ends NOT well", "A few months later, the trio happen to cross each other at a hall. Jim is happy to see Jules, and not so excited about seeing Catherine again. Cat insists on going out on a drive, and they all go for it. She drives recklessly, and it gives the feeling of her mood swings to some extent. It definitely must be a surge of blood within, as she sees Jim after about three months.\nThe trio stop over at a café in a dance hall. The entire footage is shot at a fast pace showcasing the intensity in the minds of the characters. Also, the way of shooting the driving scene is fantastic considering the technology available in the early 60s.\nAt the café, Jules discusses with Jim about his relationship with Catherine. He recounts how Jim easily got along with her, but, eventually proved to be a bit too much to handle for even Catherine. Simply, Jules here is suggesting how Catherines tendency to discover love with multiple partners, was justified, but, she couldnt take it when Jim loved Gilberta apart from her. She couldnt tolerate sharing her love. Jules, though appears wiser with his own experience, still cannot comprehend Jims love for Catherine.", "This scene has a metaphorical placement of drinking glasses on the table. There are two glasses on one side of the table, and the third one adrift. The two glasses cannot symbolise Jules and Cat, because Cat doesnt go back to a love she has overcome. Same is the case for Cat and Jim. Without doubt, it is about Jules and Jim, and the camaraderie and homo-eroticism shared between the two in several previous scenes suggests, that this is perhaps the only everlasting relationship of the film. At this time, Catherine asks Jim to join her for a ride, and asks Jules to keep watching.\nThey ride together, and in a few minutes the car is on a bridge, which is broken at the other end, and the car crosses this end only to plunge into the river. It reminisces of Catherines fall into the Seine, but only that this one is more tragic than imagined. Interestingly, this part has been improvised by Truffaut and the scripter Gruault, and is not from the book.\nJules as usual continues to be dazed by Catherines capriciousness and he really cant get enough of her dead or alive. The scene of the car going down is representative of the downward spiral, the duo went through in the last few months, as also gives the message of how such relationships cannot work out for long. As long as, only one of the two partners was ambivalent and had multiple partners, it seemed fine. But, it all went haywire when Catherine met almost her equal in Jim. Jules, who had always been a spectator to Catherines actions, at best is feeling a sense of Relief.\nSubors narration from hereon is soothing as a contrast to the chilling climax. He narrates the entire cremation process.\nJules is left with Sabine, and the rest is all gone into ashes. Jim and Catherine are incinerated considering their Catholic practices. Jules would have their ashes mixed.\nCatherine wanted hers to be strewn from a hill-top, but it wasnt permitted.\nThe urns with the ashes are sealed and kept away.\nThe entire cremation scene, with a compelling background narration has been shot in a marvellous way. Catherine, the free soul wanted her ashes to become a part of the earth and the air. This was not permitted by laws. It is a brilliant metaphor for how, the idea of freedom a woman is not accepted by the patriarchal society, and all the movements form women equality are in vain, unless something so simple for a woman to equal man in terms of rights is granted.\nJules walks off, and one can interpret it as a walk back to the society, which will permit the usual relationships, and probably outlaw characters like Catherine.\nFrom Jims angle, it was about moving on, and reading Catherine correctly, almost every time, but for the last moments.\nFrom Catherines perspective, it was always about settling scores. It was about ferociously pursuing her love, and be very non-chalant about it at the same time.\nShe really brought a closure to the story and her relationship, where her intense love for Jim lead to only one message Not with you, Not without you."]},

Many years ago, while investigating a robbery at the First National Bank of Toontown, Eddie and Teddy were chasing a guy who dropped a piano on them from 13 stories up. The piano broke Eddie's arm, but killed Teddy. Valiant never did find out who the toon was, except that he had 'burning red eyes' and a 'high squeaky voice.'

Arriving at the studios, Roger is told to stay by the car.", "Valiant meets with Maroon, who seems very nervous about the whole thing. Valiant uses Roger's love-letter as a ploy to throw Maroon off-guard, and then knocks the Studio Owner to the floor, wanting answers. When Maroon denies any wrongdoing, Valiant runs his tie through a movie-o-la, almost strangling him. Maroon explains that he had a chance to sell his studio, but Cloverleaf also wanted Acme's property as well. When Marvin refused, Maroon planned to blackmail him with pictures of him (Acme) and Jessica. Maroon then goes on to try and explain more, when suddenly gunfire erupts, and Maroon is wounded. Valiant goes to the window where the shots came from, only to see Jessica running away.", "Valiant returns to his car, only to find Roger gone. Giving chase, he follows Jessica's car but stops when it drives into the tunnel leading to Toontown. Valiant arms himself with a toon gun (complete with toon bullets), and heads into Toontown. After a series of madcap hijinks through the toon city, Valiant finds himself in an alley, with Jessica pulling a gun on him. However, the bullet she fires streaks right past him. When she approaches, she points to a gun on the ground behind him. Apparently, Doom was planning to shoot Valiant, and her bullet saved his life. This is the same gun that was used to kill R.K. Maroon. Far off in the distance, the two see Doom running away, claiming that they're 'all dead.'", "Jessica and Valiant try to get Valiant's car to give chase, but it appears to be gone. As well, roger has disappeared from Jessica's trunk (apparently, she had knocked him out and put him in the trunk to keep him from getting hurt). Both Jessica and Valiant manage to thumb a ride from Benny, who helps them escape from Toontown. In the car, Jessica tells Valiant that Acme knew Doom was after Toontown, and gave her the will for safekeeping. However, the envelope containing the will only held a blank sheet of paper.", "On the other side of the tunnel, Doom is waiting with a barrel of Dip, that ends up flattening Benny's tires, causing him to crash. Doom then has Valiant and Jessica taken to the Acme Factory. The two are frisked for the will, but nothing is found. It is then that Doom explains his master plan. Planning to end his career as a Toontown judge, he is now going to take advantage of his stake in Cloverleaf Industries (of which he is the sole stockholder). Pulling aside a giant cloth, he shocks Jessica and Valiant with a giant Dipmobile, containing enough dip to wipe out Toontown in a matter of minutes. Doom's master plan is to build a freeway in its place: a concept that will allow high-speed driving, and end traffic jams. Valiant balks at this, saying that people can still take the Red Car Trolley Line for a nickel. It is then that Doom reveals that his purchasing of the Trolley Line was part of his plan, as he plans to dismantle the transportation system, making people have no alternative but to use his freeway system.", "Just then, Roger bursts through a sewer pipe, but is quickly subdued. Doom has both Roger and Jessica hung at the far end of the room, planning to 'dip' them. As he confidently walks away, he trips on some spilled gag eyeballs and falls to the ground. Angered at the weasel's laughing, he angrily shouts, 'One of these days, you idiots are gonna laugh yourselves to death!' As he disappears around a corner, Valiant manages to distract the weasels, by tumbling, falling, and using some Acme gags nearby. His lunacy causes the weasels to do just as the judge promised, and they all die laughing. However, one of the weasels, Psycho, had turned on the dipmobile's cannon, which is heading right for Roger and Jessica. Valiant manages to abort the cannon's direction, but not before being knocked about by Judge Doom. During the scuffle, Doom ends up getting his hand and foot coated in a super-strong glue, and soon ends up under the front of an Acme steamroller. Screaming at his predicament, he is severely flattened. However, he suddenly rises off the floor, hopping about. Valiant makes the correct assumption that the Judge was actually a toon. Re-inflating himself, Doom reveals who he really is: the toon that many years ago killed Teddy Valiant. Doom then starts the dipmobile back up, and then proceeds to kill Eddie with a giant toon buzzsaw. However, Eddie opens a rear valve on the dipmobile, sending a wall of dip on Doom, causing him to melt into a puddle of paint.", "With the dip spent, Roger and Jessica are saved, as the dipmobile then crashes through the wall, creating an opening into Toontown, where the dipmobile is hit by a fast-moving train.", "After Eddie manages to clear the Gag Factory's floor of dip, Roger and Jessica are lowered to the ground, just in time for Benny to return with the police, Dolores, and Lt. Santino. Eddie explains that it was actually Doom who killed Marvin Acme, as well as R.K. Maroon, and his brother Teddy. All the toons of Toontown arrive to see the carnage and comment about the death of their would-be murderer. As Baby Dolores complains their town is still in danger of being demolished by another developer, Delores notices a stain on Eddie's shirt, it appears that the ink that Acme squirted him with, according to Roger, was 'disappearing and reappearing' ink. Getting an idea, Eddie returns the love letter to Roger, who begins to read it. As Roger reads the letter, a number of words begin to appear, and Eddie's hunch is correct: The blank piece of paper that Roger found in Jessica's dressing room, was Acme's will, written in invisible ink, and as promised, the will gives ownership of Toontown to the toons!", "Having noted Valiant's funny dance for the weasels, Roger asks Eddie if he has gotten over being a sourpuss. When Eddie mentions that 'only time will tell,' Roger offers to shake his hand...but failing to mention a hand-buzzer that shocks Eddie! Eddie pulls his hand away, with an angry look. \"Don't tell me you've lost your sense of humor already,\" says a fearful Roger. Eddie then grabs him by the neck and asks, \"Does this answer your question?\" Eddie's 'answer' is a cartoony kiss to Roger's lips...proof that Eddie has gotten his sense of humor back!", "Eddie, Dolores, Roger and Jessica then walk off towards Toontown, as a number of cartoon characters sing the song, 'Smile, darn ya, smile!' Meanwhile, Porky Pig is among the Toon cops clearing the scene and realizes he has found a good line to end the story, \"That's All, Folks!\" as he address the audience just before Tinkerbell flies in to tap the scene in her own tradition to bring this unique film collaboration to a close."]},

Multicultural in more forms than anticipated, are the leading and upwardly mobile alien race who have gelled themselves into the Human psyche and exploited it to its full potential. This is the story of an everyman, a no one, a Nada who stumbles upon their secret, via an underground movement, whose mission is to sabotage their plans and awaken the world to its sinister plans. With the help of a pair of sunglasses, that shows the world as it really is, not in color, but a black and white parallel world that the sub-conscious has chosen to ignore. With subliminal messages as \"OBEY\", \"CONFORM\", \"MARRY AND REPRODUCE\", \"CONSUME\", \"WATCH TELEVISION\" and \"SLEEP\". It is through this thought control that the aliens have this world tied up and neatly packaged for its own manipulative uses, to further themselves at the expense of the meek, mild and the lowly sufferers of a job less and hungry world. This is the battle of self-awareness and one mans struggle with a reality check that has these alien beings staging war against the up-rising and rebellious armies from the gutters and streets. They Live You Sleep; where will your consciousness take you when the sleep is washed from your eyes. Welcome to the real world.", "They influence our decisions without us knowing it.

Aliens are systematically gaining control of the earth by masquerading as humans and lulling the public into submission. Humanity's last chance lies with a lone drifter who stumbles upon a harrowing discovery - a unique pair of sunglasses that reveal the terrifying and deadly truth.", "John Nada is a man without job who walks around a big American city trying to find something to do. He finally finds a job as a worker and a place to spend the nights, but one day something terrible happens to him. John discovers a pair of sun-glasses through which he can see the true face of people. Many persons in this city are in fact aliens (from the Andromeda) and most of them are important members of our society. They keep humans in ignorance and they rule our world as they like. Nada must find the rest of the men that know what's happening (those who made the strange sun-glasses) and join them in the fight against the aliens.", "George Nada (Roddy Piper) is a homeless laborer who arrives in Los Angeles looking for work. The national economy seems to be in decline and the poor and middle class have been especially hard hit, living in shantytowns across the city. Nada listens for some seconds to some rambling street preacher (Raymond St. Jacques), but he dismisses his message and leaves when he notices that the police are coming.", "After visiting an employment office that has no job opportunities for him, Nada eventually finds work on an L.A. construction site. One of the workers, Frank Armitage (Keith David), is suspicious of Nada, especially when Nada follows him after work. He confronts him angrily, but realizes Nada's just looking for a meal and a place to sleep so he takes him to a local shantytown where most of the workers live. After eating at the soup kitchen and spending the night, he notices odd behavior at the small church across the street; a police helicopter hovers over the church and shantytown and a few of the people from the church race out, looking at the copter with dark sunglasses. Investigating, Nada discovers that the church's soup kitchen is a front: inside, the loud \"choir practice\" is a recording, scientific machinery fills a back room, and cardboard boxes are stacked everywhere, including some in a secret compartment that he stumbles across. The leader of the group (Peter Jason) is aware that Nada is onto them. The Street Preacher suddenly surprises him, probing Nada's face with his hands, indicating he's blind. When he notices that Nada has got rough hands because of all the physical labor he's done, he lets Nada go free.", "That night, a large police force arrives and surrounds the church, forcing the inhabitants to flee. The police then turn on the shantytown, destroying it with bulldozers and beating the blind minister of the church to death. Nada, Frank, and most of the inhabitants flee. Nada returns to the site the next day and investigates the church again, which has been emptied. He takes one of the boxes from the secret compartment and opens it in an alleyway. Expecting to find something valuable, he is a little disappointed to find it full of cheap-looking sunglasses, the same type the church staff wore when the helicopter flew over. He keeps one pair and hides the rest in a garbage can.", "When Nada later dons the glasses for the first time as he walks down a sidewalk on Rodeo Drive, he discovers that the world appears in shades of gray, with significant differences. He notices that a billboard now simply displays the word \"OBEY\"; without them it advertises that Control Data Corporation which is \"creating a transparent computing environment.\" Another billboard, which displays \"Come to the Caribbean\" emblazoned above a lovely woman lying on a beach, now displays the text: \"MARRY AND REPRODUCE.\" At a nearby newsstand, all the printed material contains subliminal advertising in capital letters most of which read: \"OBEY, \"CONSUME\", \"SLEEP\", \"NO INDEPENDENT THOUGHT\", and \"DO NOT QUESTION AUTHORITY\". While he stares disbelievingly at a magazine containing the subliminal messages, a man walks up. When Nada looks at him with the glasses, he sees a strange humanoid with bulging eyes and mottled skin. When Nada removes the glasses, the man looks like a white, male human. The man gets in his car and drives off while the owner of the newsstand approaches Nada, telling him to move on. Nada sees that paper money the man holds bears the words \"THIS IS YOUR GOD.\"", "Nada soon discovers that many people around him are actually the same type of humanoids. Most of them are wearing expensive clothing resembling wealthy-looking businessmen and women. When Nada enters a local grocery store and insults one of them, the elderly lady speaks through her wristwatch, muttering about his location and the face that he \"can see.\" Nada runs out of the store and into an alley where two humanoid policemen suddenly arrive. The two \"policemen\" ask where Nada got the sunglasses and he refuses to answer them. Aware that they intend to kill him, Nada escapes, killing both policemen. He steals a police shotgun. While evading the police, he stumbles into a local bank filled with humanoids. Realizing that the jig is up, he proclaims, \"I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass... and I'm all out of bubblegum.\" A shooting spree ensues as Nada opens fire, firing on all the humanoids that he sees. After killing many of them, one of the humanoids sees him and disappears after twisting a dial on his wristwatch. Fleeing the bank and into a nearby parking garage, he forces a woman (Meg Foster) at gunpoint to take him to her house in the Hollywood Hills.", "At the woman's house, Nada takes off the glasses to rest. Rubbing the bridge of his nose, he remarks: \"wearin' these glasses makes you high, but, oh, you come down hard.\" Nada tries to convince the woman, whose name is Holly Thompson, about what is happening, but she remains skeptical. When Nada lets his guard down after Holly tells him that she's an executive at a local TV station, she tricks him into turning on the TV set and suddenly pushes him through her window. He falls hard down the hilly slope below her house. He leaves behind his pair of sunglasses, however, for her. Without putting them on, Holly calls the police.", "The next morning, Nada sneaks back to the construction site to talk over with Frank what he discovered. Seeing Nada as a wanted man for the shooting spree, Frank is initially uninterested in his story. Now a fugitive with no one to turn to, Nada returns to the alley where he disposed of the rest of the sunglasses. Nada recovers the box by breaking into a garbage truck that nearly carries it away. Just then, Frank shows up with money, Nada's wages from the construction job he'd never gotten a chance to collect. Seeing that Frank is human, Nada tries to persuade him to put on a pair of the sunglasses, but Frank refuses, not wanting to get involved and telling Nada that he has a family back in Detroit that he wants to keep out of trouble too. Determined to convince Frank, the two engage in a long and violent hand-to-hand fight (lasting nearly 10 minutes of the movie) as Nada attempts to force Frank to put on the sunglasses. When Nada finally subdues Frank and finally puts on the glasses, Frank sees the humanoid aliens around him as well. Nada states: \"Partner, life's a bitch... and this one's in heat!\"", "Frank joins Nada as they check into a local fleabag hotel and get in contact with the group from the church. They learn that a meeting is being held at a local community center later that evening. The community group listens to a seminar in the background introducing radical ideas. For example, the humanoid aliens are blamed for increased carbon dioxide and methane emissions \"They are turning our atmosphere into their atmosphere\" and quickly using up the planet's resources. Holly returns, claiming to now believe Nada, and delivers some information to the rebels about a possible location to where the aliens are broadcasting the subliminal messages.", "At the meeting, they learn that the aliens' primary method of control is a signal being sent out on television, which is why the general public cannot see the aliens for what they are. An unknown but brilliant inventor has created a lens called the Hofmann lens. The lens shows the world as it really is. The sunglasses, which are also available as contact lenses, interfere with the aliens' hypnotic signal. Nada and Frank are given contact lenses to replace the sunglasses. Nada then has a talk with Holly who tells him that after their encounter when he left behind his sunglasses, she put them on and hid them which is how she now believes him. Suddenly, Nada and Holly's conversation is cut short at the hideout is raided by the police, who shoot to kill. Some of the resistance members flee outside while the police (a team of both human and aliens) are gunning people down indiscriminately.", "Nada and Frank escape into an alley behind the building and get away with the help of one of the wristwatch devices that teleports them to a mysterious underground facility. They find themselves in a network of underground passages under the city that link hidden parts of the alien society including a high-tech portal for space travel. Through the passages they find the aliens are throwing a party for their human collaborators. The speaker at the podium informs everyone about the raid that just took place at the resistance's headquarters. Nada and Frank meet one of the homeless drifters (George 'Buck' Flower) whom they previously met in the workers shantytown, whom is one of the many human collaborators working with the aliens. Thinking that they have been recruited as he has, the Drifter shows them around the underground facility.", "The Drifter leads Nada and Frank to the studio of a local TV station, Cable 54, and the source of the aliens' signal. Nada and Frank pull out their pistols and kill all the alien guards, intending to shut down the hidden signal the aliens are using. The Drifter escapes by teleporting himself and sounds the alarm. Arming themselves with assault rifles from the dead guards, Nada and Frank decide to get to the roof of the building to shut down the signal to make the world aware of the aliens among them. But aware that they will not survive, even if they succeed in shutting down the signal, Nada and Frank know that this is a suicide mission.", "Nada and Frank engage in a gun battle with the guards in the studio hallways and offices. Holly, who works at the station, is found by Frank and Nada and she leads them up to the roof of the building where the dish is broadcasting. Making it to a stairway, Nada runs up to the roof expecting that Holly and Frank are behind him. Suddenly, Holly pulls out a gun, presses it against Frank's temple, and kills him. Through the special contact lenses that he is wearing, Nada notices the broadcasting antenna. Holly gets to the roof, then takes aim at Nada. Here, Nada finally realizes that Holly is yet another human collaborator with the aliens (and possibly the one who led the police to the rebels hiding spot). Then, a police helicopter appears where the aliens aboard order Nada to step away from the broadcasting antenna.", "Aware that he is a dead man no matter what he does, Nada uses a hidden sleeve pistol and kills Holly. Nada then turns his attention back to the broadcasting antenna. Nada is immediately shot and fatally wounded by alien police marksmen in the hovering helicopter, but manages to get one final shot from his small pistol and destroys the broadcasting antenna. As a last dying defiant act, Nada gives the aliens in the hovering helicopter \"the finger\" as he lies dying on the roof of the building next to Holly's dead body, and the ruins of the broadcasting dish.", "With the signal now destroyed, people around L.A. and the rest of the country are surprised to discover aliens in their midst... seeing them on TV, chatting with them at the bar, meeting with them at the office... and even having sex with them."]},

The interrelationships between Aron, Cal, Adam and Abra have the potential to change: as the United States enters the war; as Adam wants to leave a legacy to the world, namely to figure out a way to ship perishable produce, most specifically lettuce he plans to grow on what has largely been his fallow land, using the new technology of refrigeration, to feed the country, making money not to factor into the equation; with Cal wanting to make money to show his father he is worth something, the war economy which provides some opportunities; and with Cal secretly discovering that Kate, the cold-hearted, ruthless but financially successful madam operating the brothel in Monterey fifteen miles away on the coast, is probably his biological mother, and is not dead as his father has always told them.", "Set in 1917, during World War I, in the central California coastal town of Salinas. Cal \"Cain\" Trask (James Dean) and Aron \"Abel\" Trask (Richard Davalos) are the young adult sons of a modestly successful farmer and wartime draft board chairman named Adam Trask (Raymond Massey). The loner Cal is moody and embittered by his belief that his father favors Aron.", "The Trask family has a farm in the fertile Salinas valley. Although both Cal and Aron had long been led to believe that their mother had died \"and gone to heaven,\" the opening scene reveals that Cal has apparently come to realize that his mother is still alive, owning and running a successful brothel in nearby town of Monterey.", "After the father's idealistic plans for a long-haul vegetable shipping business venture end in a loss of thousands of dollars, Cal decides to enter the bean-growing business, as a way of recouping the money his father lost in the vegetable shipping venture. He knows that if the United States enters the war, the price of beans will skyrocket. Cal hopes this will finally earn him the love and respect of his father. He goes to his mother Kate (aka: Eve) (Jo Van Fleet) to ask to borrow the capital he needs. She reluctantly lends him $5,000.", "Meanwhile, Aron's girlfriend Abra (Julie Harris) gradually finds herself attracted to Cal, who seems to reciprocate her feelings despite her being involved with his younger brother.", "Cal's business goes quite well, and he decides to give the money to Adam at a surprise birthday party for his father, which he and Abra plan together. As the party gets underway, Aron suddenly announces that he and Abra are engaged. While Adam is openly pleased with the news, both Abra and Cal are uneasy, having recently discovered a mutual attraction for one another is emerging, despite their suppressed feelings. Cal makes a surprise birthday present of the money to his father; however, Adam refuses to accept any money earned by what he regards as war profiteering. Cal does not understand, and sees his father's refusal to accept the gift as just another emotional rejection. When the distraught Cal leaves the room, Abra goes after him, to console him as best she can. Aron follows and orders Cal to stay away from her.", "In anger, Cal takes his brother to see their mother, then returns home alone. When his father demands to know where his brother is, Cal tells him. The shock drives Aron to get drunk and board a troop train to enlist in the army. When Sam \"Seth\" Barrows (Burl Ives), the local sheriff, brings the news, Adam rushes to the train station in a futile attempt to dissuade him, he fails and can only watch helplessly as his son steams away from him with his head out the rail car window, maniacally laughing at him to take him to a miliary base.", "Adam suffers a stroke because of the incredible strain, leaving him paralyzed and unable to communicate. Most of the townspeople, including Sam, blame Cal for what has happened. Sheriff Sam persuades Cal to leave town and quotes a Bible verse relating the event to the conflict of Cain and Abel in the land east of Eden.", "After everyone leaves, Cal tries to talk to Adam, but gets no response and leaves the bedroom. Abra enters the room alone and pleads with Adam to show Cal some affection before it is too late. She persuades Cal to go back into the room. When Cal makes his last bid for acceptance before leaving town, his father manages to speak. He tells his son to get rid of the annoying nurse and not to get anyone else, but to stay and take care of him himself. The film ends with Cal and Abra sitting by Adam's bedside, the emotional chasm between the father and son apparently closed."]},

As the struggling family tries to settle in their new isolated homestead, before long, disaster will strike when their infant child vanishes into thin air, and, shortly after, other unforeseen and grievous calamities smite the God-fearing farmers. However, is this grave situation the result of a family on the brink of psychological breakdown, or is William's first-born daughter, Thomasin, the root of all evil?", "The film starts with William (Ralph Ineson), the patriarch of a Puritan family, on trial in 1630s New England. He dismisses those around him as false Christians, and the others claim that he speaks ill of the word of God.", "William's family includes his wife Katherine (Kate Dickie), eldest daughter Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy), son Caleb (Harvey Scrimshaw), twins Mercy (Ellie Grainger) and Jonas (Lucas Dawson), and baby Samuel. Having been banished from their New England plantation, they start a small farm in the wilderness. Mercy and Jonas frequently play with a large black goat that they named Black Phillip.", "One afternoon, Thomasin is outside playing Peek-A-Boo with Sam. She covers her face to scare him, but when she looks down, Sam is gone. We cut to somewhere in the darkest part of the woods where a wrinkled hand strokes Sam's body, moments before the creature lowers a knife to his chest. We then see a haggard old woman pounding what appear to be Sam's remains before consuming them. The woman then slowly walks out into the woods.", "Katherine becomes distraught following Sam's disappearance. The family believes that a wolf took the baby. Caleb goes out to hunt with his father, but first he starts to notice Thomasin's breasts.

William grabs a hatchet and seems ready to fight, but he then drops it, allowing Black Phillip to charge at him again and knock him into a pile of logs that crushes him.

Mann's journey is going reasonably well until he encounters a slow-moving tanker truck. The truck is grimy and oil-stained, and constantly belching black smoke. Mann passes the slow-moving truck, but soon after, the truck roars past him, forcing him to steer sharply to avoid a collision, then returns to its slow-moving speed. Mann rolls his eyes and passes the truck a second time, eliciting a loud, startling blast on the truck's air horn.", "Mann soon pulls into a small gas station, into which the truck follows him. The driver of the truck, unseen except for a pair of hairy bare arms and blue jeans with brown cowboy boots, is watching Mann through his rear view mirror. He instead exits the truck on the passenger side and walks alongside it, not wanting Mann to see his face.

The game continues as the slopes give way to the flat, arid terrain of the desert, until he sees a turnout on the opposite side of the road. He accelerates and races through it, passing the truck and giving the driver a gleeful snub, assuming he'll now be pulling far ahead of the truck and the incident will be behind him.

Mann is soon freaked out even more when the truck pulls up on him, reaching speeds above 90mph. The truck bumps into Mann's vehicle several times, until they reach a diner (Chuck's Cafe), where he swerves off the road at high speed, coming to rest after striking and damaging a wooden fence. A few friendly locals sympathetically try to help, but there's nothing much they can do.", "Mann enters the diner to compose himself. After returning from the restroom, he is shocked to see the truck parked outside the diner. Mann studies the diner patrons carefully and begins an inner monologue in which he contemplates the driver's motives as well as the truck's remarkable performance, and second-guesses his decision to sit helplessly in the diner. Most of the patrons sitting at the counter give Mann the impression of malice, but when one leaves, appearing to approach the tanker, he instead drives away in a pickup truck.", "Mann continues to look around the diner, and soon believes he's found the culprit sitting alone at a table. Approaching the stranger, Mann tells the man to \"cut it out\". The stranger looks at Mann as if he's crazy, and when Mann continues to accuse him, a fistfight breaks out. When the manager of the diner demands the fight stop, the stranger leaves.... only for Mann to see him get into a different truck. Mann leaves the diner, and the dirty semi roars to life; apparently the driver never entered the diner. As it takes off, Mann runs after it a ways, but as it pulls away, he stops, and watches it recede into the distance.", "Mann gets back in his car and continues on his way, soon encountering a stalled school bus. The driver asks Mann to give him a push, but Mann's small red Valiant is hardly equal to the task and ends up getting its bumper hooked under the rear of the bus. As he gets out to tell the bus driver, he panics: a short way further on, up in a darkened tunnel, he sees the semi is back, and approaching! Frantically, he manages to free his vehicle and flee, just as the semi truck arrives and pushes the bus (though the driver is still not seen).", "Mann continues on his way, stopping at a railroad crossing. The sound of the train is so loud that Mann doesn't hear the truck creeping up on him. When it begins to push Mann into the side of the still-moving train cars, Mann attempts to reverse his car to keep from going further. (Note: although the truck could easily overcome any resistance the car might offer, it doesn't, showing that the driver intends to torment him but not injure him... yet.) Just as it seems his efforts have failed, the train finishes going past, and Mann throws the car into 'drive.' Mann drives a ways on, before he veers off the road, with the truck continuing on.", "A short distance ahead, Mann pulls into a place called Sally's Snakerama Gas Station to call the police and refuel his Plymouth while the truck is seen pulling to a stop ahead on the road. He goes into a phone booth to call the police, but before he can get through, the truck starts up, turns around, roars up, and plows into the telephone booth, with Mann barely jumping clear in time. The truck proceeds to chase Mann as he is on foot, destroying the Snakerama. Terrified, Mann jumps into his car and speeds away. He then hides behind an embankment off the road and sees the truck pass by, apparently without noticing him. He thinks to himself that he'll just wait \"at least an hour,\" sure the truck will be long gone, and dozes off in exhaustion. Shortly thereafter the train approaches, and in his tortured sleep he confuses the sound of the locomotive's horn with that of the truck, until the train bursts past him and he awakens fully, suddenly laughing almost hysterically in relief.", "Mann then heads off again but is dumbfounded to see that the truck is waiting for him a few miles ahead, just around the bend! Mann stops his car, gets out, and attempts to walk up to the truck to confront the driver and ask why he is chasing him. But when Mann approaches to within a few yards from the truck, the driver (still unseen except for a silhouette) starts up the truck and drives off up the road a short distance, taunting him. The driver clearly does not want to establish any visual or verbal contact with Mann... or let him see his face.", "Mann returns to his car and attempts to get help from an older couple in a car that is passing by. But the elderly and senile couple think that he is crazy due to his frantic and desperate tone of voice... until they see the truck themselves, backing up towards them at increasing speed. After the elderly couple drives away leaving Mann behind, the truck changes direction and approaches Mann's car, seemingly intent on wrecking it. Mann flees off the road on foot into the desert, but just then the truck stops short, then moves ahead again. By now Mann's state of mind has progressed from victim to warrior; the real duel has begun. Aware that he is on his own, Mann returns to his car. The truck driver, being careful not to let Mann (or the viewers) see his face, sticks his left arm out of the truck's driver's side window and again beckons Mann to pass him. Mann starts his car, shifts into drive, passes the truck, and a climatic high-speed chase begins.", "Mann again finds himself unable to outdistance the truck, but takes comfort knowing he'll soon reach a steep grade of a nearby mountain on which the truck can't possibly keep up. When he reaches the grade for a steep hill, he is able to put some distance between himself and the truck and starts to relax. But just as he calms down and regains his confidence that he is out of danger, the weak radiator hose fails and the now-overheated engine can no longer deliver more than barely enough power to take the car to the summit. The truck quickly begins gaining on him. Mann barely makes the summit and coasts down the other side as he shifts his car into neutral just as the truck bears down on him.", "Mann allows his car to coast down the hill, giving the engine a chance to cool down. Descending at speeds too great to control, the red Plymouth Valiant spins out and impacts against a rock wall. The truck speeds toward the damaged car as Mann desperately tries to get it started, succeeding just in time to avoid the truck. He drives off the road and up a dirt road, reaching a dead end which is a locked gate to a nearby ranch that sits beside the edge of a massive cliff. Mann turns his car around to face the oncoming truck. Wedging his briefcase on the accelerator, Mann sets his car right into the path of the truck, jumping out at the last second. The driver of the truck hits the car, but upon realizing there's nowhere left to go, he jams on the brake, but too late.

Alas, Iago knows Othello's weakness, and with chilling malice works on him with but too good effect.", "In the late sixteenth century, Othello, a Moor who is the leading general in Venice, elopes with Desdemona, the only daughter of influential senator Brabantio. Othello's ensign, Iago, witnesses the secret ceremony, and jealous that Othello has promoted Michael Cassio to the position of his lieutenant instead of Iago, alerts Brabantio. The elderly senator is horrified and rushes to the palace to demand justice. There, the senator discovers that the duke is already seeking Othello, because the Turks are about to invade the Venetian garrison at Cyprus and Othello has been elected to defend it. Othello, accompanied by Desdemona, appears before the duke and the senate, and denies Brabantio's charge that he has bewitched Desdemona. Othello reveals that while he was a guest of Brabantio, he would relate his life story, and Desdemona grew to pity and love him, and he began to return her love. When Brabantio demands that Desdemona state whom she should obey, the self-confident young woman states that she owes her father for her life, but that her ultimate loyalty lies with her new husband. Devastated, Brabantio warns Othello that as she deceived her father, so may Desdemona deceive her husband, but Othello dismisses his concerns. While Othello is being told about his new commission, the proceedings are watched by Iago and his stooge, Roderigo, who is also in love with Desdemona. Although Othello believes that Iago is sincere, Iago is actually scheming to destroy him. After Othello and Desdemona consummate their marriage, Othello leaves Venice to fight the Turks, and Iago escorts Desdemona to the Cyprus garrison. Some time later, Othello arrives at the fortress with news that the Turkish fleet has been destroyed by storms, and is joyously welcomed by Desdemona. After Othello orders a celebration and retires with Desdemona, Iago persuades Cassio, who is supposed to be on watch, to drink with him. Soon Cassio is drunk, and Iago engineers a brawl between Cassio and Roderigo, which wakes Othello. Disappointed that Cassio is drunk and fighting while on duty, Othello demotes him. Later, Iago consoles Cassio, who is distraught that his reputation has been tarnished, and advises him to ask Desdemona to talk to Othello about reinstating him as his lieutenant. Later, Othello and Iago spot Cassio and Desdemona talking, and Iago whispers that he does not like seeing them together. Othello shrugs off Iago's insinuation and, when Desdemona asks him to receive Cassio, genially agrees. Irritated, Iago questions Othello about Cassio's role in his courtship with Desdemona, as Cassio occasionally acted as their go-between. Iago casts aspersions on Cassio's and Desdemona's honesty, and although Othello is reluctant to believe him, he is haunted by Brabantio's warning. Seeing that Othello is upset, Desdemona tries to calm him using the handkerchief that he gave her as a special love token, but he tosses it away and storms off. The handkerchief is retrieved by Emilia, Iago's wife and Desdemona's lady-in-waiting, and despite her misgivings about her husband's motives, Emilia gives him the handkerchief. Iago then goes to Othello, who demands that Iago supply proof that his wife has been unfaithful. Iago spins a tale of hearing Cassio talk in his sleep about his love for Desdemona, then seeing him wipe his face with her handkerchief. Enraged, Othello orders Iago to kill Cassio and appoints Iago as his lieutenant. Iago then tosses the handkerchief into Cassio's room, where it is found by Bianca, Cassio's courtesan. Meanwhile, Desdemona again approaches Othello about Cassio, but when Othello learns that she cannot find her handkerchief, he angrily orders her to leave. Iago then arranges for Othello to eavesdrop as he questions Cassio, supposedly about his affair with Desdemona. Iago actually asks Cassio about Bianca, who is in love with him, much to Cassio's amusement. Hearing only Cassio's laughter, Othello is outraged, especially upon seeing Bianca with Desdemona's handkerchief. Although he is convinced of her betrayal, Othello is still torn by his love for Desdemona until Iago tells him that Cassio confided that he slept with her. Othello has an epileptic fit, and after Iago revives him, Othello muses that he is so crushed that he can no longer function as a soldier. Othello then learns that Lodovico, a messenger from Venice, has arrived with a summons for him to return home, leaving Cassio in charge of Cyprus. When Desdemona states that she is pleased by Cassio's promotion because of her affection for him, Othello misunderstands her innocent comment and strikes her. Soon after, Othello interrupts Desdemona's prayers and accuses her of being a whore. Emilia then comforts the anguished Desdemona, who cannot understand the change in her husband. Meanwhile, Othello asks Iago to procure some poison for him to use on Desdemona, but instead Iago advises him to strangle her in her bed. Iago then goes to the steam-baths, where Roderigo, who has been giving Iago jewels to bribe Desdemona, declares that he is returning to Venice, as Desdemona has not returned his affections. Iago, having kept the jewels for himself and hoping for more, convinces Roderigo to remain, telling him that if he kills Cassio, Desdemona and Othello will have to stay at the garrison. Urged on by Iago, the foppish Roderigo attempts to kill Cassio but only wounds him. While Cassio's friends search the baths for the assailant, Iago spots Roderigo hidden beneath the floorboards and stabs him to death. That night, Othello approaches Desdemona as she waits in their bed and, after ascertaining that she has prayed, strangles her, despite her protestations of innocence. Emilia rushes in just as the dying Desdemona asks her to commend her to her \"kind lord.\" The grief-stricken Emilia then cries out that Desdemona was faithful to Othello, and that it was Iago who planted the handkerchief in Cassio's room. Fellow Venetians Montano and Gratiano enter with Iago as Emilia continues telling Othello that he was deceived by Iago, and Iago stabs her. Iago is apprehended by Montano and Gratiano, who bring him before Othello. Othello confesses that he conspired with Iago to kill Cassio, and that he strangled Desdemona. Horrified by what he has done, Othello stabs himself, then staggers to his bedroom, where he clasps Desdemona's body. Asking his friends to speak kindly of him, Othello begs them to describe him as one who \"loved not wisely but too well,\" then dies with Desdemona in his arms."]},

But some things never change. After a brush with the law and a field trip to Los Angeles' Griffith Observatory, Jim's unfocused teenage angst gets him neck-deep in trouble again when he catches Buzz's eye, the school's brazen delinquent. As the young rivals engage in a dangerous test of valour, two unexpected allies become Jim's unusual alternative family. Before long, the wheel of estrangement and defiance comes full circle. And the question remains. Does life always give second chances?", "Shortly after moving to Los Angeles with his parents, 17-year-old Jim Stark (James Dean) enrolls at Dawson High School. In the opening scene, Jim is brought into the police station for public drunkenness. When his mother, father and grandmother arrive at the police station to retrieve him, conflicts in Jim's family situation are introduced as he explains to the arresting officer. His parents are often fighting. His weak-willed father (Jim Backus) often tries to defend Jim, but Jim's picky and domineering mother always wins the arguments for his father cannot find the courage to stand up to his wife. Jim feels betrayed both by this fighting and his father's lack of moral strength, causing feelings of unrest and displacement. This shows up later in the film when he repeatedly asks his father, \"What do you do when you have to be a man?\"", "The next day, while trying to conform with fellow students at the school, he becomes involved in a dispute with a local bully named Buzz Gunderson (Corey Allen). While Jim tries to deal with Buzz, he becomes friends with a shy 15-year-old boy, John, who is nicknamed Plato (Sal Mineo), who was also at the police station the night of the opening scene for shooting and killing puppies. Plato idolizes Jim as a father-figure much to Jim's concern. Plato tells Jim that his parents divorced several years ago and are never in Los Angeles. His mother lives away in her hometown and never visits, calls or writes, while his father (a wealthy business executive) is always traveling and avoids comming home, leaving only his housekeeper to look after Plato. Plato experiences many of the same problems as Jim, such as searching for meaning in life and dealing with his absent and selfish parents who \"don't understand.\"", "In the school hallway, Jim meets Judy (Natalie Wood), whom he also recognizes from the police station the previous night, where she was brought in for being out alone after dark, who originally acts unimpressed by Jim, saying in a sarcastic tone, \"I bet you're a real yo-yo.\" She is apparently the property of Buzz. Judy too has an unhappy homelife when it shows her before going to school when she deals with her unattenative and sexist father who gives all his attention to Judy's younger brother as well as ignors both Judy and his wife for he feels that women are ment only to serve him, and nothing more.", "That afternoon, Jim goes on a field trip with his science class to the Griffith Observatory. At the Planetarium, he watches a dramatic presentation of the violent death of the universe. After the show, he watches Buzz and his thugs slash a tire of his car for no reason, and then Buzz challenges him to a knife fight, while the gang taunts Jim as a \"chicken.\" Jim reluctantly takes part in the fight and wins, subduing Buzz by holding his switchblade up to his neck before discarding both knifes off a railing. Both Jim and Buzz get slight injuries during the knife fight. Not to be outdone, Buzz and his thugs challenge Jim to a \"Chickie Run\" with Buzz and Jim racing stolen cars towards an abyss. The one who first jumps out of the car loses and is deemed a \"chicken\" (coward).", "That evening, the \"game\" is held with Judy and several students in attendance to watch.

Jim refuses to speak to any policeman and will speak only to the sergeant and he leaves. But Jim is spotted leaving the station by three of Buzz's friends, Crunch (Frank Mazzola), Goon (Dennis Hopper), and another one of Buzz's gang members whom is not named. Mistakenly thinking that Jim told the police about the \"Chickie Run\", they decide to hunt Jim down to \"silence him\"... permenently.", "Jim meets up with Judy and they go to an abandoned mansion to hide out.

Jim and Judy follow him inside, and Jim convinces Plato to lend him the gun, from which he silently removes the ammunition magazine. When Plato steps out of the observatory, he becomes agitated again at the sight of the police and charges forward, brandishing his weapon. He is fatally shot by a police officer as Jim yells to the police, too late, that he had already removed the bullets. Plato was wearing Jim's jacket at the time, and as a result, Jim's parents (brought to the scene by police) think at first that Jim was shot. Mr. Stark then runs to comfort Jim, who is distraught by Plato's death. Mr. Stark promises to be a stronger father, one that his son can depend on. Thus reconciled, Jim introduces Judy to his parents and they drive off together as dawn starts to break."]},

The documentary touches on chattel slavery; D. W. Griffith's film \"The Birth of a Nation\"; Emmett Till; the civil rights movement; the Civil Rights Act of 1964; Richard M. Nixon; and Ronald Reagan's declaration of the war on drugs and much more.", "The 13th Amendment to the U. S. Constitution abolished slavery. But it also included a provision many people don't know about and that is what this documentary brings to view. \"Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist.\" That exception justifies the use of forced labor as long as the laborer is a convict. This documentary makes the case that inclusion of this loophole is only one of the justifications for continuing domination of people of color. The 13th Amendment was ratified in 1865 and director Ava DuVernay supports her thesis through the use of both historical footage and interviews. Film clips of former President Richard Nixon call for 'Law & Order' which has resulted in exploding prison populations. The U. S. only has 5% of the world's population but has 25% of the world's prisoners. This Law & Order policy enabled government to imprison blacks. John Ehrlichman was Assistant to President Nixon for Domestic Affairs: \"Did we know we were lying? Of course we did.\" The documentary makes the case that those drug busts, Jim Crow laws and segregation are all variations of domination of black America. Currently the 'Prison/Industrial Complex' is just a new version of the same old problem. Here DuVernay returns to the 13th Amendment and makes the case that the system cannot be dealt with by making small changes. The system itself has to be rebuilt."]},

Is there an escape from the demonic madness and the plague of the Evil Dead?", "Five friends go up to a cabin in the woods, where they find unspeakable evil lurking in the forest. They find a tome called the \"Necronomicon\", Book of the Dead, and the taped translation of the text. Once the tape is played, the evil is released. One by one, the teens are possessed. With only one remaining, it is up to him to survive the night and battle the evil dead.", "Five Michigan State University students venture into the hills to spend a weekend in an isolated cabin. There they find the Book of the Dead (a Babylonian and Sumerian text, unrelated to the Egyptian Book of the Dead), otherwise known as the Morturom Demonto.", "While searching the basement of the cabin, the students find and play a tape recording of demonic incantations from the book, unwittingly resurrecting slumbering demons that thirst for revenge. The professor also mentions that his wife was possessed by the risen demons and that the only way to insure possessed individuals are stopped is to dismember their corpses. The characters are gradually possessed one by one, beginning with Cheryl (", ") after she is brutally raped by the evil force (using the nearby trees) in sequences of intense, bloody violence and horrifying voice-overs.", "Cheryl makes it home to the cabin but nobody believes her ordeal. Her brother Ash (", ") then decides to drive her into town where she can stay the night. They discover that the only road bridge is completely destroyed and the supports are bent into the shape of a hand. Soon after, Cheryl becomes a demon and stabs Linda (", ") in the ankle with a pencil. They lock her in the cellar, but soon after Shelly (", ") becomes possessed and attacks Scotty (", ") who dismembers her with an axe. They wrap the dismembered body-parts in a blanket and bury them, after which Scotty leaves to find a trail out of the woods.", "Ash goes to check on Linda, but finds her to be possessed also. Scotty returns, but is mutilated by trees. Before losing consciousness he tells Ash there is a trail in the woods. After Linda tricks Ash by returning to (seemingly) normal, Ash drags her outside. He goes back to check on Scotty, who dies. Linda later returns and tries to stab Ash, but she falls on the dagger. Ash drags her outside to cut her up with a chainsaw, but he simply buries her instead. She rises from the grave and Ash beheads her with a shovel. The head soon comes back to life and taunts him, and the body arises and chases Ash back to the cabin.", "He returns to find the cellar door open. Cheryl jumps at the window and tries to break in. Ash shoots her, but she doesn't die. Ash barricades both the front and back doors. He runs back into the cellar to find a box of shotgun shells and experiences a strange series of events including the cellar filling with blood and hearing things in his mind.", "Cheryl tries to attack Ash through the door, but he shoots her and then slides a bookshelf in front of the door. Scotty's dead body suddenly animates and he and Cheryl come at Ash again. Suddenly they begin to scream, and smoke starts to rise from their bodies. Ash notices that The Book of the Dead has fallen into the fireplace. He puts it directly into the flames and the demons stop and begin to rot away as dawn breaks. Ash is the only survivor. He heads outside and stands there for a while, thinking he has survived the ordeal; but the evil \"force\" runs him down. The screen goes black as Ash turns around with a look of terror on his face as the Evil catches him."]},

As the deceptions mount, it becomes more and more difficult to figure out who is conning whom.", "In Buenos Aires, the swindler Juan cheats the cashier of a convenience store with a bill-changing scam observed by Marcos. Then Juan tries to lure the cashier on the next shift but he is caught by the manager. Marcos claims to be a police officer and arrests Juan; he also brings the money claiming to be evidence. Sooner Juan learns that Marcos is actually an experienced con artist and he invites Juan to be his partner in a scheme. They head to a five-star hotel where Marcos meets his estranged sister Valeria in the reception. She tells that Marco's friend Sandler is very ill and wants to talk to him in the locker room. Sandler explains that he had forged a sheet of the valuable stamps Nueve Reinas using a picture he took from the collection that belongs to his sister. He also tells that the Spaniard Vidal Gandolfo that is lodged in the hotel is a collector of stamps and will travel on the next morning. Therefore, the stamps should be negotiated on that day. Marcos distributes percentages to a network of swindlers to work with him but there are too many con artists in action luring each other.", "Two grifters - boyish, likable Juan and hard-edged, scheming Marcos - meet by chance. Marcos, who seems to have cheated everyone he knows including his siblings, is missing his partner, so he offers to teach Juan tricks for a day. Juan accepts because he has some savings, but needs more to bribe a judge to release his father from prison. Marcos gets a call from an aging, ill ex-associate needing help to sell a forged set of rare stamps, the Nine Queens, to a businessman about to be deported (he can't take cash out of Argentina, but could take the stamps). When the con men have to improvise, Marcos asks Juan to use his savings to set up the deal. Is Juan about to be conned?", "The film opens at a convenience store early in the morning. Juan, a con artist, successfully scams the cashier, but later messes up by attempting the same scam again on the next shift. Marcos, who has been observing the whole time, steps in pretending to be a police officer and takes Juan away. As soon as they are far enough from the shop, Marcos tells Juan he is not actually a cop but a fellow con man. Juan asks Marcos to show him the ropes, because his father, also a con man, is in jail and he needs to raise money quickly to bribe a judge to reduce his father's sentence from 10 years to 6 months. He needs $70,000.", "Marcos is sympathetic with Juan but cannot help him raise this much money so soon. Marcos & Juan roam the city the whole day performing cheap tricks to swindle small sums of money. All the while Juan earns Marcos's trust and respect.", "Then a rare scheme seemingly falls into their laps: Sandler, a former business associate of Marcos, needs his help to sell counterfeit copies he made of some rare stamps called \"The Nine Queens\". Sandler contacted Marcos by sending a message through Marcos's sister Valeria. Valeria & Marcos are on barely talking terms & Valeria makes it very clear that the only reason she called Marcos was that Sandler was creating a scene at the hotel where she worked. Seems Marcos has cheated Valeria & his younger brother out of their fair share of their grandfather's inheritance.", "But the younger brother does not believe Valeria & maintains that Marcos is blameless & could not have done anything to cheat Valeria and himself. Valeria has sued Marcos & the case is currently in court. Sandler informs Marcos that he copied the nine sisters from the original, which are held by his widow sister, who was left the collection by the dead brother-in-law. She wouldn't sell the stamps, but Sandler was able to make a copy.", "The potential mark is Gandolfo, a rich Spaniard who is facing deportation and desperate to smuggle his wealth out of the country. Sandler is again the person who informs Marcos about the buyer. Sandler says that he selected Marcos because he fell ill after coming to the hotel (looking for Gandolfo) & saw Valeria & thought of Marcos. Marcos asks for a 90% cut in exchange for making this sale for Sandler. Juan desperately pleads Marcos for a cut, making Marcos believe that this is a sure bet, he is fully in. Marcos has Sandler by the balls. Gandolfo has no time to fully check if the stamps are authentic, but he hires an expert to do a quick check and is satisfied.", "He offers $450,000 for the stamps, the exchange to take place that evening. Marcos had expected $30,000 for the stamps as he had no idea of their real value, so this is a massive jackpot for him & he has grandeur of retiring comfortably on the back of this deal.", "In the intervening time, a number of things go wrong. The stamp expert demands a cut, as he knew the stamps were in fact forged. The fake stamps are then stolen out of Juan and Marcos' hands by crooks on motorcycles who, unaware of their value, destroy them by tossing them into a river.", "To salvage the scheme, Marcos approaches Sandler's widowed sister, the owner of the real stamps, who agrees to sell them for $250,000. Marcos can put up $200,000 and asks Juan to contribute the remaining $50,000. Juan suspects that he is being scammed, as it's a remarkable coincidence that Marcos needs just the amount that Juan has saved up; but as the $50,000 is not enough to help his father, he reluctantly agrees. They buy the real stamps and go to Gandolfo's hotel, but he says he has changed his mind and will now only buy the stamps if he also gets to sleep with Marcos' sister Valeria, a hotel employee. Valeria's price is that Marcos must confess to their younger brother how he cheated him out of an inheritance. Gandolfo pays for the stamps with a certified cashier's check (like a demand draft), but the bank crashes the next day, making the check worthless.", "It appears that Juan and Marcos are both ruined, but the final scene is a surprise ending. Juan goes to a warehouse, where he greets the motorcycle thieves, Sandler and his sister, Gandolfo, and Juan's fiance Valeria - revealing that the real scam was to swindle Marcos out of $200,000 as revenge for all the times he cheated his family and his partners."]},

A later expedition to the island led by paleontologist Professor Kyôhei Yamane, his daughter Emiko, and young Navy frogman Hideto Ogata (who also happens to be Emiko's lover, even though she is betrothed to Dr. Daisuke Serizawa) soon discover something more devastating than imagined in the form of a 164-foot-tall (50-meter-tall) monster whom the natives call Godzilla.

A special agency is set up to look into ways to counter the creature before all international trade is stopped with Japan. The Japanese Navy goes into action, depth charging any areas Godzilla was last seen.", "In Tokyo Bay a pleasure boat full of party goers sees Godzilla; rather than attack the boat, the creature seems intent on heading for shore.

Despite their best effort, the government knows there is little hope for survivors.", "Seeing the carnage, Emiko confesses to Ogata what she really saw in the Doctor's lab There really is a way to destroy the creature. She goes on to describe how Serizawa dropped a device into a tank of fish, and seconds later all the fish were just skeletons. Serizawa explains how the device sucks all oxygen from water, causing any living creature caught by the process to liquefy instantly.", "Hearing this, Ogata and Emiko agree to confront the Serizawa and convince him to use his discovery. Serizawa counters that to reveal the weapon to the world would unleash a force greater than even the atomic bomb. The only difference is the Oxygen Destroyer could ultimately kill all mankind.", "Serizawa is concerned that, once he uses the weapon, the genie is out of the bottle and he does not know if he can get it back inside. Serizawa is torn by his choice, but he cannot see any way to resolve it. He catches a sight from the TV of people all over the country praying that Godzilla will not return. He realizes he must act and deploy the weapon.", "With a new sense of purpose, he begins to destroy the weapon's data and equipment in his lab notes.", "At sea, a ship with Ogata and Serizawa aboard a ship mounted with Geiger counters locates Godzilla. Ogata prepares to make the dive to deploy the weapon. Serizawa insists that he go with him. They only have one chance and one weapon, so it has to be done properly. Reaching the ocean floor, they find Godzilla resting and begin the work to deploy the weapon. Serizawa unexpectedly signals Ogata to return to the surface. Reaching the surface alone, Ogato realizes he has been fooled and Serizawa's solution was to die while deploying the weapon.", "With one final message, Serizawa tells Ogata that the weapon worked and he hopes he and Emiko with be happy together. The weapon's effect envelopes Godzilla. The creature struggles for a time before sinking to the bottom, uttering one final defiant roar. Moments later, nothing remains but a skeleton. Within minutes, this is gone too", "Onboard the ship, Doctor Yemane considers the concept that there must be more Godzillas out in the depths of the ocean. If man continues his experiments with atomic weapons, chances are extremely high another Godzilla will return to once again threaten civilization."]},

Two boys, Alfredo and Olmo, are born on the same day - one to the owner of a large estate, the other to one of his labourers. There is a massive divide between the classes in Italy, to the point of antagonism. Despite this, and despite some disagreements along the way, Alfredo and Olmo become best friends. We see them grow up, go to WW1 and their adult lives. Eventually their different upbringings and social standings come back to haunt them, as Italy is plunged into class war - the Socialists (workers) vs the Fascists (supported by the middle- and upper-class). Alfredo and Olmo find themselves on opposite sides.", "The film opens on April 25, 1945, the day Italy is liberated from the fascists. The peasants on an estate in Emilia-Romagna in northern Italy are shown attempting to join the partisans and place the owner of the estate, Alfredo Berlinghieri, under arrest. A balding, middle-aged man named Attila and woman named Regina are seen attempting to flee the farm but are attacked by women laborers wielding pitchforks. The narrative moves back to the start of the century.....", "On January 27, 1901 (the day of the death of renowned composer Giuseppe Verdi), two babies are born on the estate within minutes apart from each other. They are Alfredo Berlinghieri and Olmo Dalcò who come from opposite ends of the social spectrum. Alfredo is from a family of wealthy landowners led by his abusive but popular grandfather Alfredo the Elder (Burt Lancaster), while Olmo is an illegitimate peasant son of an unmarried teenage peasant girl living off the estate whose grandfather Leo Dalcò (Sterling Hayden) is the foreman and peasant strong man who verbally and spiritually carries a duel of wits with both the peasants as well as his employer, but without ever reaching violence with Elder Alfredo's bidding. While growing up, the young Alfredo (Paolo Pavesi as a child) is somewhat rebellious and despises the falseness of his family, in particular his weak but cynical father Giovanni. Alfredo meets and befriends Olmo (Roberto Maccanti as a child), who is being raised as a socialist. During this time, Leo leads labor strikes against the unfair working conditions on the farm.", "The two become friends throughout their childhood, despite the social differences of their families. When Alfredo is around age 10, his grandfather, suffering from gout, dementia, and other ailments, commits suicide by hanging himself in the dairy barn. As a result, Alfredo the Younger's father, Giovanni, inherits the plantation.", "In the mid 1910s, Olmo leaves the plantation and joins a socialist youth movement and later enlists with the Italian army during World War I and goes off to fight on the front lines in northern Italy while Alfredo stays behind to learn how to run his family's large plantation.", "In 1919, Olmo (Gérard Depardieu as an adult) returns after the war ends and has a warm reunion with Alfredo (Robert De Niro as an adult) and their friendship resumes. However during Olmo's time away, Alfredo's father has hired Attila Mellanchini (Donald Sutherland) as his new foreman following the death of Olmo's own grandfather, Leo a few years earlier. Attila is sadistic man who becomes taken with fascism, especially after the fascists come to power in 1922.", "Attila eventually incorporates his new belief system in his dealings with the Berlinghieri workers; he treats them cruelly and later cages them in the Berlinghieri compound and accuses them of treason against Fascist Italy. Several are killed by Attila himself. Alfredo's father, Giovanni, eventually dies from an illness and Alfredo inherits the vast estate as its sole heir. As the new padrone (master) of the plantation, Alfredo does little to challenge or halt Attila's evil actions.", "During the late 1920s and early 1930s, the intimacy and lack thereof in their respective relationships with others is highlighted in their love lives as both Alfredo and Olmo cannot seem to hook up with the right woman to be with. In one encounter, Alfredo and Olmo attempt to have a threesome with a local prostitute only to have her go into an epileptic fit which stops the threesome sexual encounter before it begins.", "In 1930, Alfredo marries a gorgeous, demure Frenchwoman, named Ada (Dominique Sanda), while Olmo marries Anita (Stefania Sandrelli), a fellow left-wing idealist who, like him, shares in the enthusiasm of the cause of workers' rights in the vein of socialism. Ada, however, sinks into alcoholism when confronted with the reality of the emptiness of her relationship with Alfredo.", "Anita dies tragically in childbirth, bringing another member into the community; a daughter whom Olmo names after his late wife. As Olmo takes on his fateful role of leader among the poor farmers and their families, he clashes with Attila several times as the years go on. Olmo's daughter, Anita the Younger (Anna Henkel-Grönemeyer), grows into a young and resourceful teenager whom is supportive of her father's socialist beliefs.", "As Olmo takes on his fateful role of leader among the poor farmers and their families, he clashes several times with Attila. The latter, whose psychopathic tendencies have been revealed via the murders of a cat and a small boy (the latter at Alfredo and Ada's wedding and for which Olmo is initially blamed), commits further atrocities. However, he becomes a fresh target of ridicule at the hands of the peasants; led by Olmo, they take turns throwing manure at him after Attila tries to sell Olmo like a slave. Olmo flees to keep from being killed by the fascists, and Attila reacts to the humiliation by tearing up Olmo's house with his black-shirts before caging the peasants on the Berlinghieri compound and indiscriminately shooting them. Alfredo fires Attila, but discovers that Ada has already left him.", "The film comes full circle when on April 25, 1945 as the padrone, Alfredo is captured by a teenage peasant boy carrying a rifle. Attila is also captured when he and his wife, the equally cruel and sadistic Regina (Laura Betti), try to flee the region. Attila is stabbed (non-fatally) several times by women wielding pitchforks and is imprisoned in the Berlinghieri pig sty. He is later executed by the peasants (while they cut off most of Regina's hair), who have discovered that Attila had raped and killed a young boy (ironically, the son of one of the most fervent supporters of fascism as an antidote to socialism) several years prior in a fit of rage and had also murdered a wealthy landowner's widow, Mrs. Pioppi (Alida Valli), during the winter of 1939 whose husband had been economically ruined by Alfredo, in order to steal her land and home.", "Alfredo is brought before Olmo's workers tribunal to stand trial. Many workers come forth and accuse Alfredo of letting them suffer in squalor while he (and his social class) profited from their labors and on top of that, he did nothing to stop the sadistic Attila. Alfredo is sentenced to death, but his execution is prevented after Olmo explains that the padrone is already dead even though Alfredo lives... that is, the social system has been overthrown with the end of the war. As soon as the verdict is overturned, however, representatives of the new government, which includes the Communist Party, arrive and call on the peasants to turn in their arms. Olmo convinces the peasants to do so, overcoming their skepticism. Alone with Olmo, Alfredo declares to him: \"The padrone is alive\", indicating the struggle between the working and ruling classes is destined to continue.", "The film ends with the middle aged Alfredo and Olmo playfully tackling each other as they did in their childhood, then the scene suddenly jumps forward several years to the present day 1976, with the elderly Alfredo and Olmo walking along a railway track. Alfredo lies down in the center of the tracks as his younger self would do as a game while a train would run over the tracks, but Alfredo would emerge unharmed as he would lie perfectly still. Alfredo appears to lay himself across the tracks as a train approaches in a clear attempt at suicide as if he has chosen to end his life at that time. The final shot shows the train traveling over the younger Alfredo lying perfectly still in the center of the tracks."]},

The scientists are using the undead in gruesome experiments; much to the chagrin of the military. Finally the military finds that their men have been used in the scientists' experiments, and banish the scientists to the caves that house the Living Dead. Unfortunately, the zombies from above ground have made their way into the bunker.", "Trapped in a missile silo, a small team of scientists, civilians, and trigger-happy soldiers battle desperately to ensure the survival of the human race. However, the tension inside the base is reaching a breaking point, and the zombies are gathering outside.", "Zombies have taken over the world. Isolated in a military bunker complex are a few of the last humans, consisting of a small group of scientists and army personnel. The scientists and soldiers don't see eye to eye: the scientists feel they can find a non-lethal way to pacify the zombies while the soldiers just want to kill them.", "This sequel to Dawn of the Dead is even gorier than the first two \"Dead\" films. The location is an underground government installation in sunny Florida, the purpose of which is to research the phenomenon causing the dead to come back to life.", "Restless and alone in a brick-walled room, a woman named Sarah (Lori Cardille) sees a calendar before her on the wall. It is the month of October and every day is crossed out. While gazing at the image of a pumpkin patch, a dozen decayed arms punch through the wall, clutching at her....", "She wakes from this surreal horror in the back of a helicopter. She's reminded she is living a real nightmare, looking down over a deserted Fort Myers, Florida, where they land near an abandoned harbor. She is part of a four-person team searching for survivors of a gruesome crisis that began almost a year earlier, a plague that started mysteriously and led to the collapse of human civilization. Her sometimes lover Private Miguel Salazar (Antonè DiLeo), an overworked and nerve-wracked soldier, calls for survivors on a bullhorn as they stand in this now decaying town. Amid the scattered palm fronds, a newspaper blows in the death-scented wind near an early century federal building. It's big bold headline: THE DEAD WALK! (possibly one of the last papers ever printed).", "The unburied and/or recently dead have returned to life, attacking humans to devour their flesh. Humans who are bitten become zombies themselves, thus adding to their numbers. The efforts of the military and scientists were useless to contain or cure this plague. Now the only living creatures in the outside world are the alligators, tarantulas and land crabs that scavenge remains in the streets of this city of the living dead. The hundreds of wailing hordes of undead humans turn towards the bullhorn calls and en masse, march toward the survivors instinctively like cattle, forcing the team to fly back to their sanctuary.", "The helicopter lands almost out of gas inside the military compound, surrounded by chain-link fence. A horde of the living dead have managed to find the post and surround the entrance gates, their numbers growing every day. Two more soldiers help secure the chopper, giving their new past times an afternoon break: Johnson (Gregory Nicotero), who reads the last issues of porno magazines while Torrez (Taso N. Stavrakis) grows gardens of marijuana plants. John (Terry Alexander), the calm Jamaican pilot and his flask-swilling Irish buddy and radio operator Bill McDermott (Jarlath Conroy) are anxious to get on the nearby cargo elevator, but not before urging the soldiers to fill the chopper up with gas. Sarah notices Miguel is becoming increasingly stressed and despondent: he hasn't gotten out of the chopper yet and apparently wasn't aware they even landed.", "They descend into the underground sanctuary Seminole Storage Facility, where they will not see sunlight again for days. Miller (Phillip G. Kellams) is another military officer waiting below for results of the team's search. This time he can tell it was \"another waste of time\". Everyone has to stay in the cold, lonely, clinical white cubicles of the complex while John and Bill choose to stay in one of the Winnebagos stored near the barricades. These are the corrals leading to miles and miles of caves occupied by bats... and specimen zombies, collared at an earlier time by the government. Major Cooper, the commanding officer who died earlier that morning, was buried above the complex near five other graves of men the unit has lost (four soldiers and one civilian scientist). The men had been lost to the dangers of capturing the hostile specimen zombies corralled from the caves.", "Sarah and her group meet Privates Steel (Gary Howard Klar) and Rickles (Ralph Marrero), two more soldiers who are now in charge of the zombie herding as Dr. Logan has requested two more guinea pig zombies for his experiments. Sarah and Miguel are asked by the two soldiers to go along with them. Though tired from the 24-hour search mission, they agree and travel into the caves in the golf cart towards the corral.", "At the capturing pen, Steel and Rickles both sexually harass Sarah verbally before the shell-shocked Miguel, who is of course, oblivious. Then Steel, making his sexism clearer than ever, refuses to have Sarah handle the capture and Miguel defiantly takes on the dangerous task to prove himself. He loses control of a particularly excited female specimen jeopardizing the lives of all involved. Sarah manages to re-snare the female zombie before it can bite Rickles. The hot-tempered Steel, enraged that his buddy Rickles was almost lost because of his actions, grabs Miguel, forcing him into the clutches of a caged zombie. Sarah orders him to let him go aiming her Uzi as a possible consequence. The situation calms down and two more specimens are brought back to the lab for study. Miguel is sedated by Sarah in his room, while he uncontrollably berates her.", "In the dining hall, Dr. Ted Fisher (John Amplas) pleads for sterile equipment to conduct proper tests on the specimens. The hostile Captain Rhodes (Joe Pilato), now in charge after Major Cooper's death, is also beginning to question the research that has been going on in the months the team has been sharing the facility. Sarah enters and asks that Miguel be taken off active duty as a result of the incident earlier, but Rhodes refuses by claiming that he has no one to replace him. Sarah and Rhodes get into an argument about Miguel's best interests before she and Dr. Fisher walk out.", "Throughout the day, Dr. Matthew Logan (Richard Liberty), derisively called \"Frankenstein\" by the soldiers, works on captured specimens, vivisecting the ghouls' chests and removing their organs. When Sarah enters his dark operating theatre to inform him of the meeting Rhodes has scheduled, he excitedly explains that the dead do not eat flesh out of hunger, but rather motor instinct. Another corpse is under a sheet. Logan reveals this one to be only a body with its face carved away leaving only the brain exposed. With electrodes leading to a machine, Logan begins shocking the corpse back to momentary life. Sarah notices Major Cooper's fatigues on the floor. Logan confesses the faceless body is Cooper's corpse and that he had switched it with a specimen's for burial. He wanted a fresh corpse, believing his studies could be furthered.", "Captain Rhodes holds a 7:00 pm meeting with the remaining 12 of the group. Frustrated that he has already lost five soldiers, including the commanding officer, while capturing the dangerous specimens for their \"research\" Rhodes makes threats to shut the operation down during the meeting in the dining hall. He is aware that the unit is low on ammo, food, medical supplies and now his own men. McDermott explains that his radio equipment is outdated, prompting the soldiers to claim that there may indeed be survivors but that they are out of radio signal range. When Sarah gets up to leave in the middle of bickering between Steel and McDermott, Rhodes threatens to have her shot. In fact he announces anyone who challenges his orders will be shot. None of this is taken seriously by the scientists who have gotten used to threats and the soldiers' depraved harassment.", "Later on, Sarah finds herself unable to sleep on the floor of the cubicle as Miguel lays in bed. By now he must be awake. He leans over and his whole chest has been surgically opened and as he turns toward her, his entrails spilling out. Sarah realizes it's another nightmare, the result of the visit to the lab earlier that day. She wakes to find Miguel is indeed up and waiting to hassle her about her fear she tries to keep a secret. She finally loses it, screaming at Miguel to leave the room. A few moments later, she wanders the hall of the complex, nearly getting caught in the middle of a scuffle between the soldiers, whose fight spills out into the hallway. She meets up with McDermott, who has been wandering the halls too. They head back to the \"Ritz\"-the Winnebago where he stays with John. Serving Sarah drinks, John treats her to the relaxed Caribbean atmosphere he's created in the trailer. John also gives a lengthy philosophical lecture on how he believes that the Creator has cursed mankind and that there can be no cure for zombification. He urges Sarah to forget about the research and wants to leave before the soldiers lose it completely.", "The next day, Sarah finds Fisher frustrated that the specimens are not accepting a meat substitute called Beef Treats. Logan is trying to convince them that reward is the key to conditioning them. \"Bub\" (Howard Sherman) is one specimen that seems to be under control. Logan has spared him from dissection, and instead reacquaints him with toothbrushes, razors, phones, books, tape player and even an unloaded gun. His infantile, docile behavior is unique among the zombies although Rhodes and the men witnessing this progress still think these creatures should all be destroyed.", "The next day, there's another capture attempt. Miguel once again loses control of a female specimen-an old lady, unleashing her on an unsuspecting Miller who is bitten on the neck. His finger is on the trigger of his machine gun when it goes off killing Johnson. Sarah destroys this female zombie. Miguel is then thrown into a fit of denial, attacking the priest specimen which takes a huge bite out of his forearm, forcing Miguel into hysterical shock. The priest is destroyed by Steel. Sarah runs after Miguel now fleeing towards John and Bill's area. Miller begs for Steel to end his life as he knows he would certainly become cursed with living death. Steel looms over him and blows the soldier's brains out.", "John and Bill hearing Miguel's cries, wait in front of the Ritz. As Sarah draws John's machete from his belt, Miguel is overcome by a blow to the head and laid down. Sarah amputates his mutilated arm in one clean slice. After a hasty treatment where she cauterizes the stump, the soldiers led by Rhodes confront the three heroes, ready to kill Miguel. John and Bill draw guns to defend his life. Rhodes declares that there will be no more experiments and that the specimens will be destroyed tomorrow. Leaving her shaken, Sarah finally breaks down and John comforts her.", "That night, going back to the lab for medical supplies for Miguel, Sarah and Bill discover Johnson's decapitated head has been reanimated by Logan. Horrified, they follow Logan from the refrigerator room into Bub's room. There they witness the rewards he had stressed all along... the fresh remains of Miller and Johnson.", "Just as the two realize what Logan has done, Rhodes and the remaining soldiers appear behind them. Upon seeing what Logan has been up to, the enraged Rhodes drags the pleading Logan into the refrigerator and shoots him dead. He also sees the doctor's body fall amidst the dumped corpses of the military men killed in the capture attempts. He then orders Sarah and Bill's guns to be seized. Out by the corral area, ordering John to get ready to fly, Rhodes fires a bullet into the head of Fisher to make his point. Rhodes orders Sarah and Billy into the cages leading into the zombie-infested caves. John refuses to go anywhere until they are released. Then they hear the sound of the elevator powering up.", "Steel and Rickles discover Miguel has taken apart the control box, activated the elevator and that there is no way out of the complex, the elevator being their only means of protection. They try to rewire it while Rhodes is attacked by John and knocked out. John flees with Rhodes' guns through the corral area to search for his friends in the caves.", "John yells for Sarah and Billy and kills many would-be specimens in his pursuit. Rhodes finally wakes up and he and Torrez head back to find Steel and Rickles after realizing they are without weapons. A few moments later they would need any and all weapons they could get.", "The deranged and suicidal Miguel had escaped and opened the front entrance gates above the complex. He is savagely eaten alive as the elevator lowers, carrying the hundreds of zombies with it. The three remaining soldiers run for their lives but are attacked and dismembered one by one by ten or more ghouls at once, until the whole place is infested. Steel makes it to the complex where he finds the cowardly Rhodes had locked everyone out. Steel blasts open the door and enters taking all the dead with him. He hides in a lab where Bub finds him... firing one of the weapons he had found near the refrigerator room where he found his slain master, Logan. Just as Steel reloads his weapon and has an opportunity to kill Bub from behind a door, he is reunited with the mob of zombies who've entered the room through another door. After he is bitten on his shoulder, Steel commits suicide, rather than suffer the fate of either being eaten alive by the mob of zombies or becoming a zombie himself.", "While John finally meets up with Sarah and Billy near the silo, Rhodes desperately goes for his last bit of ammunition and has a final encounter with Bub still firing his pistol (his aim getting better) who leads him to a door where a group of the dead are waiting. In a few moments, the dead are all over the labs and storage rooms feasting on the remains of the soldiers. Rhodes is torn apart and eaten alive, his last words are \"CHOKE ON 'EM!!\"", "When the three survivors finally exit the silo they see at least a hundred zombies marching towards them and the helicopter... which may or may not have any gas. John and Bill cover Sarah as she runs to the chopper door. She opens it only to be greeted by another swarm of arms...", "However, this is another of Sarah's dreams. She wakes up on an island with John and Billy fishing in the surf and birds overhead. On her calendar, she marks out November 4th - the Day of the Dead according to Latin American folklore."]}
