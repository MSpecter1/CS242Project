Living in the largely rural southwest of the country, Lucien Lacombe is a restless young man who is easily distracted. He comes from a peasant farming family, his father who is currently a POW, while his mother, with the help of laborers, operates the farm. On his latest visit home, Lucien, who has no political or nationalistic inclinations, makes attempts to join the Resistance as he does not want to return to his nursing home job in the small nearby town. He is turned down largely because of his age. As such, he is easily co-opted to join the Gestapo instead when the opportunity arises by chance, even after he sees the brutality often exacted by his new colleagues, that brutality by which he is largely unaffected emotionally, even if it is against people he knows. He seems to be motivated by money to help his mother, and the other favors he can provide through the Germans' position of power. His association with the Gestapo continues despite warnings from some that the end of the war is near and the Americans will ultimately liberate France from the Germans. Lucien's life, and that of the others involved, becomes more complicated when he falls for France Horn, the daughter of local tailor, Albert Horn. The issue is that the Horns are Jewish. Lucien may have to make a decision between his allegiance to the Germans versus his feelings for France. Conversely, the Horns have to decide how to deal with Lucien, whose association with the Gestapo they naturally abhor, and who they may not be able to refuse or deny as he is the one wielding the gun, regardless of what they feel for him as an individual. France's actions may also be driven by her feelings of being Jewish, a people who are seemingly repressed on all sides."]},

Faithfully, for twenty years, he has worked as a bank transfer agent for the delivery of gold bullion. One day he befriends Pendlebury, a maker of souvenirs. Holland remarks that, with Pendlebury's smelting equipment, one could forge the gold into harmless-looking toy Eiffel Towers and smuggle the gold from England into France. Soon afterwards, the two plant a story to gain the services of professional criminals Lackery and Shorty. Together, the four plot their crime, leading to unexpected twists and turns.", "For years, Henry Holland, a timid, bespectacled bank clerk, has been dreaming of getting his hands on the impregnable Bank of England's precious gold reserves. Nevertheless, after two long decades of service, even though Henry's got everything planned down to the last detail, the mousy gold bullion carrier realises that he can't pull it off all alone. As a result, Holland talks his artistic next-door neighbour, Alfred Pendlebury, into lending a hand to disguise gold ingots worth over £1 million as souvenir Eiffel Tower paperweights, and, before long, an audacious quartet of bank robbers embarks on a challenging and dangerous mission to strike it rich under everyone's noses. However, does fortune always favour the bold?", "From his current home where he's lived for the past year, Henry Holland, a former milquetoast who has blossomed in this environment, relays the story of his thoughts of the previous nineteen years as a poorly paid London bank clerk in the gold bullion division, he overseeing the pouring of the molten metal into ingots and their transportation from the foundry to the bank vault. While he was seen as a trusted but ambitionless employee in his virtue and preciseness, he dreamed of wealth and comfort by owning that gold. The stealing of the gold ingots was not the problem in his estimation, but rather the need to smuggle the gold out of the country in knowing that no one in Britain could handle such hot items. His dreams looked to be realized upon the meeting of Alfred Pendlebury in he moving into the same Lavender Hill rooming house as Holland, Pendlebury a designer and manufacturer of tacky souvenirs. Holland was able to convince his new housemate to be his partner in crime by transforming whatever gold they would steal into Eiffel Tower paperweights - Pendlebury usually making them out of lead - to be easily shipped to Pendlebury's Paris distribution network without detection. But Holland knew they also needed true criminals in their operation, ones they could trust not to trust, the problem being where to find such individuals. Even with what he believed were all the pieces in place to carry out the crime, Holland and his Lavender Hill Mob may have faced the plight of any best laid plan.", "In the early 1950s, Henry Holland is a timid bank clerk in London who has been in charge of gold bullion deliveries for over 20 years. He has developed a reputation for fussing over details and panicking about suspect cars following the bullion van. He appears to be a man dedicated to his job and security. But all this is a cover: he has in fact hatched the 'perfect' plot to steal a load of bullion and retire.", "The one thing that has prevented this plan from being put into operation is that selling the gold on the black market in Britain would be too risky and Holland is at a loss as to how to smuggle it abroad.", "One evening a new lodger - artist Alfred Pendlebury - arrives at the boarding house where Holland lives in Lavender Hill. Pendlebury owns a foundry that makes presents and souvenirs that are sold in many resorts, including foreign ones. Noticing how similar the foundry is to the place where the gold is made into ingots, Holland decides that the ideal way of smuggling the gold out of the country would be as Eiffel Tower paperweights for Paris, and puts this hypothetically to his new friend: \"By Jove, Holland, it's a good job we're both honest men\", \"It is indeed, Pendlebury.\"", "When Holland suddenly finds that he is about to be transferred to another department at the bank, he and Pendlebury quickly move into action. They soon recruit two petty crooks, Lackery Wood and Shorty Fisher, to help them carry out the robbery.", "The plan is simple but clever and successful. Wood and Fisher carry out the hijack of the bullion van and switch the gold to Pendlebury's works van. Holland, who is supposedly assaulted and almost drowned in the robbery, becomes the hero of the hour. The police find themselves running around in circles, unable to track down the \"master criminal\" who is in fact right under their noses giving them false statements and misleading clues.", "Meanwhile, Holland and his associates melt the gold in Pendlebury's foundry and produce dozens of souvenirs of the Eiffel Tower which they send to France. Pendlebury and Holland (who have adopted the more macho names of \"Al\" and \"Dutch\") then go to Paris in order to retrieve their disguised bullion from the souvenir shop on the real Eiffel Tower which they then intend to sell to a local fence.", "The plan goes horribly wrong through a (simple) misunderstanding with the (French) lady at the Eiffel Tower souvenir kiosk who has opened a box containing not the standard paperweights but the ones made of gold and sold six of the towers to a group of visiting British schoolgirls.", "Holland and Pendlebury pursue the girls back to the Channel port of Calais where the girls take the ferry back to England. All sorts of hold-ups, including problems with the customs men, prevent the two men from getting to the ship and the girls in time.", "If just one of those towers is found to be gold then the game is up. Pendlebury and Holland therefore track down the schoolgirls and, in exchange for a similar tower and some money, recover most of the loot. One girl however refuses to return hers since she intends to give it to a friend who is a policeman.", "The girl delivers the souvenir to the officer who is attending an exhibition of police history and methods at Hendon Police College. Also there is a police inspector who is investigating the robbery. As part of the case he checked up on Pendlebury's foundry and was told that many souvenirs bought in foreign places are actually made in England. A sudden thought occurs to him and he orders the souvenir to be tested. At that moment Pendlebury snatches it and he and Holland make their escape in a police car.", "An increasingly confusing pursuit then takes place through London, with Holland using the radio in the police car to give false descriptions of the vehicle in which the crooks are in. Eventually, though, an officer succeeds in getting into their car and arresting Pendlebury.", "Holland escapes to Rio de Janeiro where he adopts a lifestyle to which he is unaccustomed and becomes a pillar of the community. A year later he is telling his story to a British visitor before they both leave the restaurant handcuffed to one another, Holland having been found, arrested and due for extradition."]},

The two officers had fought a series of duels in the midst of great wars on some futile pretext. As the pretext was never disclosed, Conrad invented one.", "We are in 1800, in the garrison town of Strasbourg, on the Rhine. There is a lull in the Napoleonic wars, and the French soldiers are enjoying a moment of peace before resuming the slaughters. As the film opens, a young girl driving a gaggle of geese happens upon two men dueling in a meadow. Lieutenant Gabriel Féraud (Harvey Keitel), from the 7th Hussar Regiment, is in the process of settling a score with an unknown man who soon ends up skewered on the Lieutenant's épée. We learn that this man is the nephew of the Mayor of Strasbourg, and is seriously wounded, when General Treillard (Robert Stephens), Commandant of the garrison, enters his officers quarters and makes inquiries about this Lieutenant Féraud. Lieutenant Armand d'Hubert (Keith Carradine), from the 4th Hussar Regiment, admits to vaguely knowing the gentleman, and he is immediately \"volunteered\" by his Commandant to find him and bring him back to the barracks, where he will be put under house arrest. General Treillard, who must see that his soldiers obey the Emperors rules prohibiting combat with civilians, needs to investigate what happened in the meadow. It is somewhat ironical that Bonaparte, who spent a large part of his life dueling with the rest of Europe on a rather grand scale, involving tens of thousand of participants on both sides (but was somewhat of a dilettante when judged by present day's standards), had little respect for the same tradition on an individual level.", "D'Hubert, after looking all over town, ends up at Féraud's private quarters, where he learns that the Lieutenant is attending a soirée at the salon of Madame de Lionne (Jenny Runacre). At the salon, d'Hubert meets with Féraud and informs him of his mission. Féraud, having judged himself the insulted party in his morning duel, cannot comprehend the reason for his arrest. Further, he determines that d'Hubert has in turn insulted him by bursting into the salon of Madame de Lionne, disturbing him with the General's orders as he was talking to the lady. Féraud immediately challenges d'Hubert to a duel with sabers, which ends when Féraud is wounded. Now, not only has Féraud's forearm been injured, but his wounded pride demands satisfaction.", "From then on, for the next fifteen years, Féraud will be obsessed with the idea of settling his dispute with d'Hubert, holding him captive by Férauds tragic, ironic concept of honor.", "D'Hubert goes to meet his friend, an army surgeon (Tom Conti), asking his advice on how to get out of this messy situation. The surgeon tells him first, to keep away from Féraud, second, to always stay ahead of Féraud in military rank, since only duels between soldiers of equal ranks are tolerated and third, to rely on Napoleon for keeping the wars going, as there is no dueling during a state of war.", "Augsburg, one year later. Lieutenant d'Hubert meets an old girl friend, Laura (Diana Quick), one of the camp followers. She tells him she has an offer of marriage from a one-armed veteran, but they nevertheless resume their relationship. It happens that Lieutenant Féraud is in the same town, and of course they will duel again. Epées, this time. This encounter is not so lucky for d'Hubert, who ends up gravely wounded. Their seconds propose that now the honor of both parties has been saved, but The Duellists both refuse the opportunity for reconciliation. Laura nurses d'Hubert back to health, but after a face-to-face with Féraud and a subsequent consultation with a fortuneteller, she realizes that these duelists will go on until one of them is killed. If it is d'Hubert who is to die, she cannot see any future in their relationship. She decides to leave him and go and marry the disabled ex-soldier.", "Captain Féraud (he caught up in rank with d'Hubert, who was promoted earlier) and Captain d'Hubert meet in a third duel, again with sabers, in a cellar.

Captain d'Hubert and Captain Féraud duel a fourth time, on horseback. It is Féraud's turn to be wounded, seriously enough to not be able to continue the fight to its conclusion. Laura reappears on the scene. She is now a widow, and had hoped to settle with her ex-lover, Captain d'Hubert, but she sees that this is just wishful thinking. D'Hubert, too involved in this dueling matter, remains deaf to her subtle suggestion that they resume their affair.", "Russia, 1812. The Emperor's Grand Army, defeated by the terrible Russian winter and the Russian battle tactics, is in retreat. Colonels Féraud and d'Hubert are now like grunts in the \"sacred battalion,\" consisting of officers of all arms who had no longer any troops to commend. One night, around a campfire, they find themselves again face to face. They silently recognize each other. The next day, Féraud requests a volunteer to go investigate some Cossack activities in the nearby woods. The soldiers are so exhausted and despondent that Féraud had guessed rightly that d'Hubert would be the only one to follow him, with the ulterior motive of finishing their endless confrontation. Far from the camp they come face to face, each with a pair of pistols, but at that moment, a group of Cossacks appears and the two adversaries present a common front to fight them off. Following this, in a gesture of reconciliation, d'Hubert offers Féraud a drink from his hip flask, but the latter disdainfully walks away: \"Pistols, next time,\" he says.", "Tour, 1814.

After a short courtship, the two marry. D'Hubert is visited by a Bonapartist gentleman (Edward Fox), a friend of General Féraud, who tries to recruit him to aid in the planned return of the Emperor, but d'Hubert refuses.", "Following the \"Hundred Days,\" the return of Napoleon to French soil, the Emperor is defeated at Waterloo, and definitively exiled to the Island of St. Helena. Louis XVIII is returned to the throne. Many known Bonapartists are arrested, including General Féraud, and these will be executed as examples. Upon hearing the news, d'Hubert meets with the Police Minister of the Second Empire, Fouché, now Duke of Otranto (Albert Finney), and requests Férauds pardon, a request that is granted. D'Hubert asks only that his intervention on Férauds behalf be kept secret.", "Having discovered d'Hubert's whereabouts, Féraud sends two of his ex-companions in arms to set up yet another, and hopefully, final duel. The Duellists meet at dawn, on d'Hubert's property, with pistols. Two shots each, fire at will. D'Hubert gets to fire the last shot, but instead of killing Féraud, he fires a bullet into the ground, and with this gesture becomes the rightful owner's of Féraud's life: \"I shall simply declare you dead,\" says d'Hubert. The final scene shows Féraud, from the back, standing on a bluff overlooking the Dordogne River winding through the beautiful valley below. He stands wearing a two-pointed cocked hat and a long black, straight military capote, reminiscent of his Emperor's portraits on the Island of St. Helena - could it be \"le petit caporal\" (the little corporal), the Emperor himself, humiliated and defeated? It is the \"end of the road\" for Féraud: finally at peace, as he meditates on what has been his life."]},

As she refuses to question herself and respond to the need for love around her, finally her husband Calvin will ask her to leave. The story is mainly told through the younger son, Conrad, who suffers badly from the consequences of his mother's attitude and atmosphere in the family, by responding with guilt, depression and a suicide attempt, because, as a teenager, he does not have yet the tools to decipher this artificial superficiality and make the connections, until he is helped by a committed Dr Berger and finds his way out with his father."]},

Shortly thereafter, at a Christmas party, the engagement announcement of Yuri and Tonya is interrupted by Lara shooting Komarovsky, Lara's sometime lover and companion. Komarovsky is only slightly wounded and Lara is escorted out of the party by her fiancé, Pasha.", "World War I erupts and Yuri is posted to a field unit far to southwest near Ukraine. Lara is a volunteer nurse in the same area. Her husband (Pasha), disappears during a battle, and is presumed dead. As the summer of 1917 ends, the October Russian Revolution occurs, changing the entire political landscape. World War I for the Russians had begun to wind down the previous summer, ending in the winter. Yuri and Lara, having worked together in an old country estate converted to a hospital, are the last to leave the now empty facility. They are clearly in love with each other, but have managed to keep their passions suppressed.", "Yuri returns to his Moscow home to find his step-mother deceased, and his home (his step father's home) occupied by 13 additional families. The Bolsheviks are now in full control of the large cities, and collectivization has begun. But Moscow is in trouble; with virtually no food supplies or heating fuel (wood), the impending Russian winter will be deadly. One night, Yuri decides to steal some fence boards that can be burned. He is observed by Yevgraf (now a policeman and party official) and is followed home. Yevgraf knows this man is his half brother and rather than arrest Yuri, the two connect for the first time. But the works of Yuri Zhivago, the published poet, have fallen out of favor with the authorities putting the lives of Yuri, his wife Tonya, his son Shasha, and his step-father Alexander, in danger. Yevgraf arranges all the necessary travel papers and the family of 4 departs Moscow eastbound in a crowed boxcar. Their destination is Yuriatin, the small town near the family's country estate at Varykino.", "Enroute, the train stops due to civil war activity in the area. Yuri wanders away from his train, only to stumble into the military train of a communist general. The general turns out to be the husband of Lara, Pasha. But Pasha has taken on a new name, People's Commander Strelnikov. He has become a renegade, and uses his army to fight the remaining White Russians however he can. Strelnikov and Zhivago discover they have seen each other before, at the party where Komarovsky was shot. Suspicions that Yuri is an assassin or spy are determined to be groundless and Strelnikov uncharacteristically releases Yuri. Yuri and family reach their distant estate.", "It is early spring. The main house has been sealed by the local communist authorities, but the gardener's cottage remains available. The family gets the vegetable garden back in shape, and settles in for what is expected to be a multi-year stay. The family thrives, and remains in the cottage, living almost invisibly. That summer, the czar and his family are executed. The family remains in the cottage through the winter.", "Finally, the next summer, Yuri takes the short trip into Yuriatin. Lara has lived in Yuriatin for about a year, having returned there in search of her husband, Pasha (Strelnikov). Yuri and Lara meet in the local library, and an affair between the two begins. But Yuri cannot live with the conflict of the affair. His pregnant wife loves him deeply, and so does Lara. Yuri rides into Yuriatin to break off the affair.", "On the way home, Yuri is kidnapped by a Red Partisan unit and is drafted to be their medical officer. A year and a half later, in the dead of winter, Yuri wanders away from the Red Guard Unit, deserting. Yuri makes his way back to Yuriatin, discovering that his family has left Varykino for Moscow. He goes to the only other place he knows, Lara's small apartment. Starving and nearly dead, Lara brings him back to health. Lara gives Yuri a letter from Tonya, addressed to him care of Lara. The letter is dated 6 months earlier. Tonya had known of Yuri's affair, and Tonya and Lara had met. Yuri's family has escaped back to Moscow, and is being deported from Russia. Shortly thereafter, Komarovsky unexpectedly appears at Lara's apartment. He brings news that Lara's husband Strelnikov is \"gone\", Yuri is considered a deserter, and their days are numbered. Komarovsky offers help by way of transportation to the far east of Russia, Vladavastok, from which they can go anywhere in the world. Lara and Yuri refuse the offer, but know Komarovsky is right, their days are numbered.", "Lara and Yuri move themselves to Varykino, and occupy a small portion of the main house. They stay there through most of the remaining winter. Again, Komarovsky finds them and tells them that Strelnikov has been arrested just 5 miles from Varykino. Lara and Yuri must now move quickly to survive. They accept Komarovsky's offer of protection and transportation to Manchuria, and leave Varykino immediately. But Yuri remains behind, ostensibly to bring his own sledge to the train station. Lara and Komarovsky wait for Yuri on the train at the Yuriatin train station, but Yuri does not arrive. The train leaves, and Lara announces to Komarovsky that she is pregnant with Yuri's child.", "Eight years pass. Yuri is found in Moscow by Yevgraf, in poor health, malnourished and jobless. Yevgraf arranges for Yuri to get his old job back at the hospital and sees him off at the street car stop on his first day. On the ride, Yuri thinks he sees Lara walking in the direction of the street car. He attempts to get off the car, succeeds and collapses in the street. He dies of a heart attack.", "At the memorial, huge numbers of people pay their respects, much to Yevgraf's amazement. One of those people is Lara, and Lara is searching for her daughter Tonya, lost somewhere near Mongolia during the far east civil war. Yevgraf and Lara search Moscow's orphanages, but Tonya is not found. Speaking of Lara, Yevgraf narrates: \"One day she went away and didn't come back. She died or vanished somewhere in one of the labor camps; a nameless number on a list that was after-wards...mislaid. That was quite common in those days.\"", "The story his been told, and the scene returns to the project office. Although Tonya, now a young woman of about 18, wants to believe who were her parents, but only if the fact is true. Morning has come, and Yevgraf makes a final request, that Tonya think about establishing with Yevgraf a family relationship. Neither have any relatives, and Tonya promises to think about it.", "Tonya and Yevgraf part on what promises to be a beautiful day. As Tonya walks away, Yevgraf notices that she is carrying a balalaika and asks if she knows how to play it. Tonya's companion, responds, of course she does. This gives Yevgraf more proof that he may have found his niece."]},

Focusing primarily on five players, the clashes between east and west and within the ranks on each side at a Japanese POW camp, where most of the prisoners are British, are presented. For the east, there is the camp commander, Captain Yonoi, a man in the traditional sense of a Japanese warrior, he who lives by those traditions. He believes that all British are liars. His guards, including Sergeant Gengo Hara, will often subvert his command in their own views of how to get the upper hand over their prisoners while satisfying their own needs, they may or may not be willing to accept the consequences if caught, those consequences again in the Japanese tradition. For the west, there is the ranking officer representing the prisoners, Group Captain Hicksley, an RAF pilot who is all bluster in sticking up for his men. Outwardly, it is Colonel John Lawrence who tries to bridge the gap between east and west, he who is fluent in Japanese and who truly tries to understand and thus react to the actions of their Japanese and Korean captors appropriately.

Smith tells Schofield to have witnesses when he gives the orders to Mackenzie. Smith knows that some men just want a fight and Mackenzie may not call off the attack even after being ordered.", "A destroyed canal bridge near Ecoust-Saint-Mein prevents the British lorries from crossing, and Schofield chooses to part with them. He uses what is left of the bridge to cross alone and comes under fire from a sniper.

Encountering German soldiers who were occupying Ecoust, he strangles one to death and escapes pursuit by jumping into a river. The river carries him while the cherry blossoms fall. He is swept over a waterfall before reaching the riverbank.", "Schofield reaches the 2nd Battalion in the morning only to find that the attack has already begun, and that Blake's brother is among the first wave to go over the top. As the company starts to move toward the front, Schofield tries to reach Colonel Mackenzie (Benedict Cumberbatch).", "Realizing that the trenches are too crowded for him to make it to Mackenzie in time, Schofield goes \"over the top\" and sprints on the open battlefield parallel to the British trench line, just as the infantry begins its charge. He forces his way in to meet Mackenzie, who reads the message and reluctantly calls off the attack.\nSchofield looks for Blake's brother, and finds him, who was among the first wave and is bloodied but unharmed. Schofield informs Joseph of his mission and of Tom's death, passing on Tom's rings and dog tag. Joseph is deeply upset about his brother but thanks Schofield for his efforts. Schofield asks for permission to write to their mother about Tom's heroics, to which Joseph agrees. Exhausted, Schofield sits under a nearby tree and looks at photographs of his family; on the back of one of them is the message Come back to us."]},

She plans on getting singing gigs along the way to earn money to get back to Monterey by the end of the summer and the start of Tommy's school year. Alice's quest for a job at each stop leaves Tommy often to fend for himself. His behavior is fostered by Alice, as their relationship is often more as trouble-making friends than mother and son. Alice's plans often do not end up as she envisions, especially as she is forced to take a waitressing job at Mel and Ruby's Diner in Tucson, Arizona, which entails working with a disparate group, including Mel, the establishment's gruff owner/short-order cook, and her fellow waitresses, the wisecracking, foul-mouthed Flo, and the naive and shy Vera.

Alice wants to earn money as a singer, and thinks that Monterey is where she and Tommy will find happiness, but, after a short-lived gig and a psychotic boyfriend, which she first experiences on the road, she escapes, only to get as far as Tucson. It's here that she finds work as a waitress in Mel and Ruby's chaotic little diner along with new friends and a rugged and handsome cowboy, David, who all convince her to stay in Tucson. And Tommy doesn't mind either. Throughout this film, Alice struggles to be a single mom to the consistently ill-mannered and disrespectful Tommy, while also trying to find a loving man that she can stand up to. As it turns out, David lashes out at the much-deserving brat, Tommy, and challenges Alice to be a better mom and a stronger woman. Though the dramatic showdown between Alice and David in the diner is meant to convince us that Alice has finally grown a spine, it was more of a show of Alice \"trying\" to be tough, but not actually feeling it, especially because up until this point, she is mostly ineffectual. Everything she and Tommy says and does seems to be more of a repeat of their same bad behavior, rather than any progressive improvements.

The survivors - from a variety of backgrounds -gather in one of the life boats. Trouble begins when they pull a man out of the water who turns out to be from the U-boa", "In a lifeboat during World War II, survivors from the freighter torpedoed by a U-boat huddle together including columnist Constance Porter, the ship's engineer Kovac, radio operator Stanley Garrett, nurse Alice MacKenzie, millionaire Charles \"Ritt\" Rittenouse, seaman Gus Smith, steward Joe, and Mrs. Higley, a hysterical Englishwoman holding her dead baby. After the baby is buried at sea, the mother drowns herself. Though the inhabitants of the lifeboat come from vastly different backgrounds, they quickly set aside the social and economic differences that divide them in a united effort to survive. A German seaman Willy is picked up out of the sea and Constane interprets for him. Willi suggests in German the direction toward Bermuda. During a crisis, he shouts at them in English. He was the U-boat commander. Willi has a compass and is strong enough to row them to a German supply ship The others allow him to take command of the boat, their only hope of survival is to be rescued by a German supply ship, which will presumably take them straight to a concentration camp.", "After their ship is attacked by a U-boat in the mid-Atlantic, several of the passengers and crew survive. Among are a millionaire, an aristocrat, a passenger who managed to survive with her baby, a stoker, and a purser. Not many have much experience at navigation or actually manning a boat. They rescue another person from the water: a German sailor, a survivor from the U-Boat that also sank. He says he can't speak English and the others don't trust him, with good reason, as it turns out, he speaks English perfectly and was actually the U-boat's Captain. As they try to navigate their small boat to the West Indies, some will succumb to death, and all will reveal their true nature.", "An American freighter sailing from New York City to London is torpedoed and sunk by a German U-boat, which in turn is bombed and destroyed in return fire. Renowned and well-appointed photojournalist Connie Porter, whose stories focus on her in the middle of whatever the subject she is covering, is alone in one of the freighter's lifeboats, she helped aboard by Joe, one of the ship's stewards, when the ship started going down. She is most concerned about the photographs she managed to take of the bombing and the accompanying story she will write first, her appearance and her material possessions second, and the rest of the world third. Before the lifeboat leaves the area of the debris field, other survivors of the bombing are able to take refuge on the lifeboat: C.J. Rittenhouse, nicknamed \"Ritt\", a self-made wealthy industrialist; Alice MacKenzie, an Army nurse; Mrs. Higley, a shell-shocked woman from Bristol who went to the States to recover, only to give birth there, with the baby, Johnny, dying in the process of the rescue; brusque womanizer Kovac, an engine room man; Stanley, nicknamed \"Sparks\", a radio man; Gus Smith, another crew member, who is sensitive to the fact that his real last name is Schmidt; and Joe, the aforementioned steward. However, it is the ninth and last passenger to board that causes the rest just a little consternation: a man named Willi, from the German U-boat, who says that he was only a crew member taking orders, and who apparently speaks only German (a language Connie speaks fluently) and no English. In their wait to be rescued, they have to work together to survive, which ends up being a difficult process at times, as they have differing views on certain fundamental things, such as who should be in charge, and thus what they should do, and just how much they should trust Willi, who may be the most knowledgeable among them in survival on the sea. But it's those fundamental differences in them as people which may be their biggest threat in surviving.", "The movie opens with a shot of a ship's smokestack that tips as the ship sinks. There is a variety of floating debris and voices calling out in the fog. An Allied freighter is sailing from New York to London when it is attacked by a German submarine. The U-boat crew shells the passengers as they struggle to board lifeboats and is itself sunk by the defending shell fire from the freighter. After the battle has ceased and both vessels have sunk, a well-dressed and coiffed woman wearing a mink coat, renowned journalist Constance (Connie) Porter (Tallulah Bankhead), is alone in a partially damaged lifeboat with her suitcase and possessions. She spots a man swimming towards her and films him approaching with her 16-mm movie camera. Kovac (John Hodiak), an engine room crewman from the freighter, who was off duty and out of the engine room at the time of the attack, pulls himself aboard the lifeboat with Constance's help. Kovac is surprised that Constance is alone on the boat and apparently unruffled by the sinking. Connie is proud of her having been able to film the attack and subsequent action including the shelling of other lifeboats and the sinking ship that capsizes another lifeboat. Kovac is critical of her and accidentally knocks the camera out of Constance's hand and overboard while reaching to help pull Stanley \"Sparks\" Garrett (Hume Cronyn), an English radio operator, into the boat. Constance is upset with Kovac and having lost her camera and the film and story it contained. Sparks calls out for Miss Mackenzie and blows his whistle and they get a response and find 3 people floating on some wreckage. Both men then assist Army nurse Alice Mackenzie (Mary Anderson), wounded merchant seaman Gus Smith (William Bendix), and passenger C. J. (Ritt) Rittenhouse (Henry Hull) into their lifeboat.\nConnie is glad to see Rittenhouse, a friend and wealthy industrialist, has made it through the ordeal. She is also pleased to hear the yell for help from the ship's black steward Joe Spencer (Canada Lee), who had got her into the lifeboat and is found attempting to rescue a young mother Mrs. Higley (Heather Angel) and her baby. After the others help Joe and Mrs. Higley aboard, Joe explains that the woman had tried to drown the baby and herself. Alice discovers that the infant is dead, and Sparks explains that Mrs. Higley is an English shell shock victim who was sent to America, had the baby and is now returning to Bristol. Mrs. Higley does not realize that her baby is dead, and Alice suggests they deal with the baby after Mrs. Higley falls asleep and Connie lends Mrs. Higley her mink coat to keep warm.\nThe group's attention is then distracted by the arrival of the final survivor: a German crewman, Willi (Walter Slezak), who appears to speak only German. Sparks suggests that the German might be the U-boat captain. Connie, who speaks fluent German, translates Willi's story that he is an ordinary seaman and is sorry for the attack and the crew were following orders to shell the lifeboats. During an animated debate, engine room crewman Kovac demands the German be thrown overboard to drown. Kovac, reveals his family is from Czechoslovakia and wants revenge for the German invasion, but Gus, a German-American who changed his name from Schmidt to Smith out of shame, insists that a \"guy can't help being born who he is.\" Ritt asserts that they cannot kill the German according to international law, and suggests they let the majority rule. Only Kovac and his friend Gus are in favor of getting rid of Willi. Joe is surprised when he asked by Ritt for his vote, although Ritt repeatedly calls him George even after being told his name is Joe.\nIn the night, they bury the baby at sea, and Ritt starts a prayer that Joe has to finish. Mrs. Higley awakes to find the baby gone and is hysterical and the group tie her to a salvaged chair to keep her under control. The next morning as daylight appears, they discover Mrs. Higley is missing and the rope is trailing over the side of boat and Kovac somberly cuts the rope. Ritt tries to cheer the survivors by taking stock of their small store of provisions and organizing jobs for everyone as they rig a sail out of the damaged mast. They have no compass and the lifeboat was damaged along with some of the supplies and the fresh water stores. Willi consults a secret compass he has hidden in his pocket. When Ritt suggests following the German's advice about setting a course rather than Sparks direction, Kovac accuses him of electing himself captain. There is a discussion about who should be captain but Gus and Sparks say they aren't qualified. Ritt's background as an industrialist who owns a shipyard and has experience leading people is discounted by Kovac as qualifications to captain a boat. Connie tricks the German into revealing his true rank when she calls him Kapitän and he responds. Although Connie argues that the German is best qualified to run the lifeboat, Kovac angrily proclaims himself captain and orders them to follow Sparks's course to Bermuda and not the German's. As Sparks moves to the tiller with the guide rope in his hand the rope knocks Connie's typewriter over the side into the ocean.\nSparks is steering the boat and Alice is nestled next to him in conversation. As they sail, Gus's wounded leg is found to be infected with gangrene, and Willi recommends they amputate and volunteers to do the amputation as he was a surgeon in civilian life. Gus resists but Connie convinces him that his dance crazy girlfriend would want him to survive, even if he doesn't have both legs. Connie provides a flask of brandy for Gus and Alice assists Willi as he amputates the leg in rough water. Later, having gained some of the group's trust, Willi convinces the others they are on the wrong course and Kovac, hoping to save Gus's life, reluctantly accepts Willi's advice. That night as Sparks is at the tiller with Alice alongside, he notices Mars and Venus in the clear starry sky and that tells him that they are heading away from Bermuda, and not toward it.\nThe next morning, with Willi sleeping Sparks brings up his suspicions and the group discusses why Willi asked Connie for the time if he has what they believe to be a watch that he has been seen checking. Kovac urges Joe, a reformed pickpocket, to get the suspicious watch from the sleeping Willi. Joe trips and falls onto Willi and comes away with what turns out to be a compass that Willi had secretly been using to steer them toward a German supply ship. Kovac is about to stab the German when a huge storm strikes, and Gus is washed overboard and rescued and in the chaos Willi takes the tiller and starts giving orders to the group in English to get the lifeboat safely through the storm. During the storm the survivors lose their remaining food, water, and the boat's mast along with Connie's suitcase. Connie and Kovac are thrown into an embrace that turns into a kiss.\nIn the calm following the storm, Willi is rowing the lifeboat towards the German ship. Kovac laughs about their \"prisoner\" taking control, but Willi asserts it is the logical thing to do now that the storm has blown them off course. The group have all grown weak without food and water except Willi. Gus is delirious and starts to hallucinate that he is back in the States and begins drinking seawater. Connie and Kovac are shown together with Connie laying on Kovac's lap and Alice and Sparks are also huddled together. Connie and Kovac have a heated discussion about her diamond bracelet and she reveals they both come from the same neighborhood on the south side of Chicago but she got out. An angry Kovac starts a card game with Ritt an and forces the stakes higher until the pot is $50,000 but before they can reveal their hands the wind comes up and blows the paper cards into the water and there is a dispute over who won.\nOne night Gus sees Willi drinking water from a bottle and wakes Sparks to tell him but Sparks pays not attention to his rambling. Hoping to keep his water supply a secret, Willi then pushes Gus overboard where his weak, drowning cries reach Sparks. Upon waking, the others discover Gus missing and Willi is questioned. Willie gives the group a lecture about how he, as a German, was better prepared than them. After the group realizes that Willi is sweating, which requires hydration, Joe grabs a water flask from Willi's shirt. The flask is broken, and Willi admits that he has been subsisting on hoarded water, food tablets and energy pills. In a spasm of anger led by Alice, the group, except Joe, descend upon him as a group, beat him, and eventually push him overboard. Ritt then strikes Willi in the water multiple times with Gus' boot. Utterly disillusioned by Willi's behavior, Ritt laments, \"What do you do with people like that?\"\nLater, the survivors are defeated and Connie yells at them for being quitters. Joe had been unsuccessfully fishing without bait and Connie gives Kovac her diamond bracelet to use as a lure. Just as they are pulling a fish in Joe spots a ship and the fishing line is released and Connie loses her final possession after previously losing her film camera, her mink coat, her typewriter and her suitcase. The ship is the German supply vessel that Willi was trying to reach and it sends a launch over to pick them up. Just as they German launch is hailing them the ship signals them to return and they turn away from the lifeboat. A boom on the horizon turns out to be gunfire from an Allied warship. The German launch is sunk, the ship tries to escape and almost swamps the lifeboat before it is also hit and sinks.\nAs the group awaits rescue by the Allieds Joe shows Ritt a picture of his family and reveals that his son's name is George. Ritt offers to pay Kovac the $50,000 he lost on the last hand of the card game and Kovac initially refuses but Connie interjects and advises Kovac that he owes her a new bracelet. Then a young German sailor grasps the lifeboat rail and is brought on board. Swayed by his youth, the women want to save him, but Kovac and Ritt want him thrown overboard. The German sailor pulls a gun on the boat occupants but is surprised and disarmed. He asks in German, \"Aren't you going to kill me?\" Kovac muses, \"'Aren't you going to kill me?' What do you do with people like that?\""]},

Already at an early age she is different from the other kids. She gets an education as a teacher but since she is considered abnormal she stays at a mental institution for eight years. Success comes when she starts to write novels.", "This is the bio of the great fiction writer, Janet Frame, based on her trio of autobiographical works. It covers her life in New Zealand as she grows up in a loving but poor family. Her relationship with her doting parents, one brother and three cherished sisters makeup the first part of the film. She was a brilliant child who, as a teen, was misdiagnosed as having schizophrenia. The result of that diagnosis is portrayed in stark detail. The last third of the film covers Janet's exploration of the world and her life in Europe as her books are published to acclaim.", "Life is not kind to little Janet Frame. She is an outsider at school and poverty reigns at home in the large family. Her brother suffers from epileptic seizures and her eldest sister dies in a swimming accident. Early on, the chubby redhead creates a counter-world of fairy tales for herself, and Janet owes her survival to this magical fantasy. This is where she will take refuge when later, in a panic, she drops out of her teacher training course and, after a suicide attempt, is admitted to a mental hospital. After eight years of fear and torment, she is released and gets to know Europe during a literary scholarship. After her father's death, she returns to New Zealand and becomes the most famous writer in her home country. Jane Campion describes the painful path of a woman's coming of age, who sees herself as an outsider from an early age. Strange in everyday life and supposedly ugly, Janet develops a special view of the world at an early age. Jane Campion succeeds in depicting this view, in making the perception of a child's fantasy visible through the camera, with seemingly simple means. She carefully strings together the small tragedies of a difficult childhood, always with an eye for the absurd comedy hidden in the small scenes of everyday life. No desperate cry for freedom is raised, but the desire noticeably permeates life stage after life stage until the path is fought free via literature."]},

This unique feature documentary is his witness statement. In his 93 years, David Attenborough has visited every continent on the globe, exploring the wild places of our planet and documenting the living world in all its variety and wonder. Now, for the first time he reflects upon both the defining moments of his lifetime as a naturalist and the devastating changes he has seen. Honest, revealing and urgent, DAVID ATTENBOROUGH: A LIFE ON OUR PLANET is a powerful first-hand account of humanity's impact on nature and a message of hope for future generations. Created by award-winning natural history filmmakers Silverback Films and global conservation organization WWF, the film is Directed by Alastair Fothergill, Jonnie Hughes and Keith Scholey and Executive Produced by Colin Butfield. Celebrated British naturalist Sir David Attenborough has a broadcasting career spanning over eight decades. He has visited every continent on the globe, exploring the wild places of our planet and bringing the wonders of the living world to audiences worldwide through groundbreaking natural history series. His work includes: Life on Earth, Planet Earth and more recently the Netflix original documentary series Our Planet.", "From Pripyat, an area deserted after a nuclear disaster, Attenborough gives an overview of his life. Interspersed with footage of his career and of a wide variety of ecosystems, he narrates key moments in his career and indicators of how the planet has changed over his lifetime. As a child, Attenborough enjoyed studying fossils. His documentary career began in the 1950s when he began working for the BBC, a British public service broadcaster. He visited places such as the African Serengeti, in which native animals require vast areas of land to maintain grazing patterns. Over time, he noticed a decline in wildlife when searching for fish or orangutans in Borneo or other animals which he was looking for as part of his documentaries. Areas of the Arctic or Antarctic were different to what the filming crew expected due to ice caps melting. The causes are anthropogenic climate change and biodiversity loss pushing the planet towards a sixth mass extinction event over a period of centuries rather than the hundreds of millennia that built up to previous mass extinctions.", "Attenborough describes the film as his \"witness statement\" and gives an impression of what could happen to the planet over the course of a lifetime beginning in 2020 and lasting as long as his own, were human activity to continue unchanged. The Amazon rainforest could degrade into a savanna; the Arctic could lose all ice during summer; coral reefs could die; soil overuse could cause food crises. These irreversible events would cause mass extinction and exacerbate climate change further.", "However, Attenborough describes actions which could prevent these effects and combat climate change and biodiversity loss. He asserts that the solution has been \"staring us in the face all along. To restore stability to our planet, we must restore its biodiversity. The very thing that we've removed.\" He proposes re-wilding; moreover, he says that bringing countries out of poverty, providing universal healthcare and improving girls' education would make the growing human population stabilise sooner and at a lower level. Renewable energy such as solar, wind, water and geothermal could sustainably power all human energy usage. Protecting a third of coastal areas from fishing could allow fish populations to thrive and the remaining area would be sufficient for human consumption. Humans changing their diet to eliminate or reduce meat in favour of plant-based foods could allow land to be used far more efficiently. Attenborough cites government intervention in Costa Rica causing deforestation to reverse, Palau's fishing regulations and improved use of land in the Netherlands as good examples."]},

As the mission unfolds, however, double and triple Agents begin to appear in the ranks of the rescue team, with the added mystery of American Lieutenant Morris Schaffer (Clint Eastwood) assigned to the mission for reasons unknown.", "It is the winter of 1944. A lone transport plane, in German Luftwaffe insignia, picks its way through the peaks of the Bavarian Alps by night. Inside, seven paratroopers, in German Fallschirmjaeger uniform, wait in grim silence for the jump signal. Among them is their leader, Major Smith (Richard Burton) and his junior officer, Lieutenant Schaeffer (Clint Eastwood). The others: Christiansen (Donald Houston), Barkely (Peter Barkworth), Thomas (William Squire), Mac Pherson (Neil Mc Carthy) and Harrod (Brook Williams) are enlisted men. In the silent tension, Major Smith ponders his mission briefing.", "Flashing back to headquarters in London, the Fallschirjaeger paratroops turn out to be a team of highly trained British MI6 agents (except for Shaeffer, who is on loan from the American OSS). Briefed by intelligence chief, Admiral Rolland (Michael Hordern), and his executive officer, Colonel Turner (Patrick Wymark), the team's mission is to rescue a captured American, General Carnaby (Robert Beatty), an Allied planner for Operation Overlord (D-Day). The General's plane has been shot down, and he is being held prisoner at the Schloss Adler (Castle of Eagles), an impregnable mountain-top fortress that also serves as headquarters for the German Alpine Korps. The prisoner must be rescued before he can divulge any information about Operation Overlord.", "Back in the present, the plane reaches its drop zone and the seven commandos parachute into a snow-covered mountain wilderness. Unseen by any of the men, a mysterious woman, also in Fallschirmjaeger gear, emerges from the planes cargo compartment and jumps after them. Smith's team gathers on their landing zone, only to find that their radioman, Harrod, is missing. After a quick search, he is found dead, his neck apparently broken in the drop. However, Major Smith is suspicious. Though the radioman's neck is bruised, there are no logs or large rocks buried beneath the snow to account for such an injury. He keeps silent, however, about his misgivings, and the group carries on to shelter in a high Alpine farmhouse that remains unoccupied in winter.", "Once there, Smith claims he's forgotten the code books carried by the dead radioman and goes back out into the night to get them, but instead detours around to the barn where he meets the mystery woman from the plane, Mary (Mary Ure). They obviously know each other very well, and after an hour of her company, Smith returns to the farmhouse. A skeptical Lt. Schaffer sits there patiently waiting, cleaning his gun, He obviously doesn't believe a word of Smith's story, but says nothing.", "The next day, the team climbs over the next ridge in the mountains, and see the Schloss-Adler castle on a peak across the valley. Waiting until dusk, they descend and sneak into the village at the base of the mountain. Changing into Wermacht uniforms, they bluff their way into the village and enter an inn, listening for information on Gen. Carnaby. Smith has a coded exchange with the barmaid (who turns out to be a British agent as well), and shortly thereafter meets both her and Mary in the woodshed behind the inn. He explains that he's in a hurry to get into the castle above because the Germans don't really have an American General, but instead have an impersonator named Cartright Jones who knows nothing about the second front. Astonished, Mary can't believe they've gone to all this trouble to rescue an imposter, but Smith has no time for further explanations, and produces forged papers that will get Mary into the castle that night with a new job as a servant.", "Exiting the woodshed, Smith finds another member of his team murdered, laying in the snow behind a scout car. He rejoins Schaffer in the inn, who has had enough of Smith's deceptions, and demands to be told the real story behind this mission, or he's out. As Smith starts to explain, the SS bursts in, capturing Smith, Schaffer and the other three agents. Smith and Schaffer are driven away in a staff car, while the other three men are taken away for questioning. Mary meanwhile rides the cable car up to the castle and begins to make her preparations.", "A mile from the village, Schaffer and Smith manage to start a fight in the car and to kill the German soldiers. They hike back to the village, pick up their hidden gear, blow up a warehouse as a diversion, steal a motorcycle and drive back out of the village along the road to the airport. They install small bombs on the telephone poles along the road, and rig trip wires to snow-poles along the road edge. Returning once more to the village, they find their three fellow agents being led into the cable car for a trip up to the castle, and make their way quickly up onto the roof of the terminal. As the car pulls out, Smith and Schaffer climb onto its roof, riding unseen up to the castle.", "After a harrowing ride on top of the cable car, they leap to the ledge above the terminal and claw their way up. Far above, Mary lowers a rope from a castle window, and they climb up the cliff face. Laying their final plans, Smith and Schaffer quietly make their way to the castle's great hall, where the Germans are talking to \"Carnaby\" over brandy and cigars. Since he politely but firmly refuses to tell them anything, they must regrettably resort to Scopolamine to get the information they want. The three captured members of Smith's rescue team are also brought in, and it is revealed that they are really double agents, posing as British but working for the Germans. As they are about to inject the fake General with truth serum, Smith quietly walks up out of the shadows surprising everyone, and declares that the double agents are still lying. Smith himself is tracking them, and he is really working for SS Military Intelligence. Pointing his gun at an astonished Schaffer, Smith tells him to sit down and shut up.", "Smith goes on to prove his true loyalties to the German High Command, and manages to convince the three traitors that they have been trapped. Desperate to prove they are really on the same side, they write down all the info they have on Nazi agents working in England. Smith gathers this up and asks German Col. Kramer (Anton Diffring) to review it, then quietly signals Schaffer to get ready. \"Compare their notes with my original,\" he tells Kramer, handing him another notebook. Leafing through it, Kramer finds all the pages are blank, and is stunned by the realization that Smith had duped them all. He really is a British agent, and has tricked the Nazis into revealing their entire spy network in England.", "In the ensuing confusion, Smith and Schaffer (who tells Smith that he's \"about as confused as I ever hope to be\") battle their way back out of the castle and onto the cable car. Escaping back down to the village, they highjack a large bus and speed out of town with the Germans in hot pursuit. Tripping the bombs they'd laid ealier as they drive by, the telephone poles are blasted in half and fall to block the road. The Germans are slowed but not stopped, and use dynamite of their own to blast through the obstacles. The team manages to beat them to the airport, where the same plane that had flown them in now swoops down and lands, allowing them to clamber in and escape through a hail of gunfire.", "Taking a long sigh of relief, they sit back as they're met in the plane by the man who'd sent them on this mission, Col. Turner (Patrick Wymark), second in command of British Intelligence. As he reviews the list of agents in disbelief, as Smith calmly tells Turner that there's one name that isn't on the list: that of the top German agent in England, confirmed by Colonel Kramer back at the castle. He shows the note to Turner, who shoots an alarmed look back at Smith.", "\"It's your own name Colonel,\" he says. \"Don't look so surprised.\"", "Pointing a gun at Smith, Turner calmly tries to talk his way out, but cannot. When in desperation he pulls the trigger to shoot Smith, the gun doesn't fire; Smith had removed to firing pin before the mission. With no cards left to play and facing certain hanging, Turner, sweat beading on his forehead, calmly asks if there is an alternative.", "\"Do you want it?\" asks Smith.", "Turner nods. He slowly gets up, walks to the door in the rear of the plane and opens it. Taking a last bitter look at Smith, he jumps to his death.", "\"Is that it Major?\" asks Schaffer tiredly as he replaces the door.", "\"Yes, that's it,\" replies Smith. He leans back in his seat and closes his eyes. The plane lumbers on through the night, returning to England."]},

Doolittle attends, volunteers to auction the pies, and buys Loretta's last one for $5, more than a days wages for a coal miner back then. He and Loretta sit down together, he tries a slice of the pie, and it turns out she put salt instead of sugar in it. He and Loretta leave early, walk through the woods to her house, see a glimpse of the mine in town, and exchange their likeness for each other. Doolittle declares he wants to get out of the community and how the war changed him for the better on how he can live a more fulfilling life. Loretta doesn't seem to understand, with her very limited view of the world and probably never having been more than a few hours away from her home in her lifetime. Doolittle kisses her goodnight and says he will bring his jeep the next day to pick her up", "The next day, Doolittle brings his jeep up to the Webb household and Loretta gets in and rides with him, without her mother's consent.

Her father tries to lighten things up with the Grand Ole Opry on their radio with Bill Monroe's \"Blue Moon of Kentucky\" playing. Doolittle enters the house and immediately the family leaves the room so Loretta and Doolittle can be alone. Doolittle proposes to her and asks permission from her parents, but both of them won't answer and tell him to ask the other parent. Doolittle explains to them while they're in bed that night he wants to marry their daughter, despite her age, and that he'll do whatever it takes and break his back to make her happy.

Loretta is now a mature woman keeping house and competent cook, making up jars of apple butter and managing her kids. Doolittle is working as a logger.

They begin their months long tour all over the south visiting the disk jockeys of the places Doolittle sent records to. The first station they visit is from a dj claiming he played her record and liked it, but she found it in the pile and reprimanded him for lying. After months on the road of sleeping in their car and subsisting on bologna sandwiches, crackers, and Cokes, they meet with record promoter, Hugh Cherry. Loretta says the word \"horny\" on the radio and did not know that was considered dirty and the manager declares he will never play another record of hers. However, Hugh finds out just now she is #14 on the country charts and it will be played.", "Loretta and Doolittle travel all night, pull over to the side of the road, and make out.

Patsy has been in the hospital recovering from a near fatal car accident. Loretta at first is intimidated by Patsy's outspoken and brassy personality, but the two become friends almost immediately. ", "For the next several months or so, Loretta and Patsy make tours together on the Grand Ole Opry, at county fairs, and the like.

She pleads with Doolittle that she can't do the concert, but he feels she should just go out and perform. She comes onstage, but instead of singing, opens up her personal life on stage about how her concert appearances, fame, and all have been overwhelming and exhausting for her, but that she appreciates her fans caring about her. She collapses and has a nervous breakdown and Doolittle carries her out.", "Months pass by and Loretta spends her life resting away at the ranch. Doolittle takes Loretta out not too far from the ranch one morning and shows her a little house he wants to build. They have an argument about where the window should go and Loretta doesn't like the way he kept the house a secret from her. But they make up", "After about a year of recovery, and in 1970, Loretta is back on stage once again and sings her signature hit \"Coal Miner's Daughter\".", "Coal Miner's Daughter opens with Loretta Webb (Sissy Spacek) riding a mule to the coal mine to meet her Daddy when he completes his shift. As the opening credits continue, the film shows some coal miners deep in a Kentucky coal mine where one yells \"fire in the hole,\" which is followed by an explosion. Then the film switches to Doolittle Lynn (Tommy Lee Jones), who is dressed in his Army uniform, driving a jeep with a blonde girl sitting next to him. Doolittle talks to several of the miners in front of the company store bragging about his beat-up jeep. He cons them into betting he can't climb a heap of red dog (a hill of mining trash) in his jeep. Ted Webb (Levon Helm), Loretty, as he calls her, and Herman, a younger brother, enter the company store where Ted asks the storekeeper if his Sears Roebuck order has arrived. While the storekeeper fetches Ted's order, Doolittle coaxes his jeep up the trash heap and wins the bet. When the Webbs return home to their rundown cabin in Butcher Holler, we meet Loretta's mother, Clary (Phyllis Boyens), and the rest of the Webb brood: eight children who range in age from infancy to age thirteen.\nMeanwhile Doolittle hikes up the mountain to see his moonshine making friend, Lee Dollarhide (William Sanderson). Doo, as Lee calls him, had worked for Lee selling moonshine to the miners before he went into the Army. Lee admits to the rumors that he steals from the moonshiners over at Greasy Creek when his own supply runs low. He offers to go fifty-fifty if Doo will help him with his moonshine business. Lee reminds his friend that men born in the mountains of eastern Kentucky have three choices: \"coal mine, moonshine or movin' on down the line.\" Back at the Webb cabin, Daddy Webb presents the children with the shoes he had ordered from Sears Roebuck (in the summer they went barefooted, but in the winter they get shoes). On this occasion Loretta receives a dress in addition to shoes; she gets something extra, Ted explains, because she's gettin to be a woman. The first time in the film that Loretta sings she takes her youngest sibling out onto the porch and sings the traditional mountain song, \"In the Pines,\" a cappella. While she's out there, Lee starts another run on Greasy Creek and is shot by one of his moonshine competitors. Soon Doo and his Pa lead Lee's mule with his body draped over it past the Webb home. Doo's Pa is glad his son wasn't working for Lee or he would likely be draped over the mule beside his friend.\nThe scene changes to a community gathering where several of the youngsters are playing musical chairs while a string band plays. After the game there is a pie auction, for which Doo volunteers to be the auctioneer. When it comes time to auction Loretta's chocolate pie, Doo and another young man compete to be the highest bidder. Doo finally wins for $5. While the crowd square dances, Doo tries a bite of Loretta's pie and immediately spits it out. She had put salt instead of sugar in her pie by mistake. Later, he offers her a ride in his jeep, but she won't accept. So, he walks her home. During the walk Doo talks about how much he learned about the outside world while he was in the Army. It made him realize he doesn't want to be a coal miner. When they get to her cabin, he kisses her good night (it was her first kiss). As he's leaving he promises to bring his jeep up to her cabin and take her for a ride, but she doesn't think he can get it up the holler. The next morning, true to his word, Doo drives his jeep up the holler to take Loretta for a ride - a wild ride. When Doo almost plunges the jeep off an embankment, he kisses Loretta. She is breathless partly from the kiss, but also from the wild ride. Doo tells her, \"That's the way youre supposed to feel when youre in love.\" When she returns home after dark, her Daddy whips her like she was a little girl and tells her to stay away from Doo. Later, when Loretta and her father go to a shallow mine for coal for the family to burn, he talks to her about her relationship with Doo; she's not even fourteen and he's a wild grown-up. He begs his \"shinin' pride\" not to throw her young years away, but she loves Doo and they want to get married. Back at the cabin while the family is listening to the Grand Ole Opry on their battery-powered radio, Ted encourages his wife, Clary, to do her squaw dance. Ted sings along with Bill Monroe's \"Blue Moon of Kentucky\" while Clary dances. While everybody is watching and listening, Doo knocks on the door, but they don't hear him, so he comes in anyway. Once they realize he's in the cabin, Clary stops dancing and goes into another room and Ted turns off the radio and leaves the cabin. Once Loretta and Doo are alone, he shows her the money he had saved from his Army paychecks. He reminds her that the next day is their anniversary (he doesn't say anniversary of what), so he thinks it would be good time to get married. Loretta likes the idea, but tells him to ask her Daddy, who tells him to ask Clary, who tells him to ask Ted - back and forth. Finally, Doo waits until they are in bed and goes into their bedroom to ask them both at the same time. Ted asks him to promise two things: don't hit her and don't take her far away from home. Doo promises. The next day at their wedding there are two ladies sitting in the pews of the rustic church. Ted finally walks in the back door, stands there long enough to answer \"I do\" when the preacher asks who gives this woman to be married to this man, and then leaves. They don't have wedding rings to exchange. At the motel on their wedding night, it is freezing. Loretta puts her night gown on over her other clothes, partly because she's so cold but also because she's afraid of sex. Doo forces himself on her, which frightens and disgusts her. The next morning she won't go into the adjoining restaurant because she's sure people will stare and know what they've been doing. Doo tells her she better get used to it. When she says, \"I ain't gonna get used to you gettin' on me and sweatin' like an ol' pig,\" Doo breaks one of the promises he had made her Daddy; he slaps her. Doo goes to work at the coal mine while Loretta tries to learn how to be a house wife. Doo loses his patience with her lousy cooking, her lack of house cleaning and her innocence about how to love her man, so he gives her a book, \"Sex for Newlyweds.\" In the following scene, Loretta trudges up the holler towards her folks' cabin; Doo has thrown her out. When her Daddy says, \"I believe married life's makin' you fat, girl,\" her mother immediately realizes her daughter is pregnant. Loretta goes to the doctor and sure enough, before her fourteenth birthday, she is pregnant. When she leaves the doctor's office, she sees a girl flirting with Doo so she picks up a stick and runs her off. Doo tells Loretta he's leaving Kentucky. He's going to Washington (state) to find a job; he refuses to be buried alive in the coal mine. He plans to send for her as soon as he saves enough money. She reminds him of his promise not to take her far away from home. Well, he says, she'll just have to choose which is more important: being her Daddy's daughter or his wife. He gives her a ride home and on the way she tells him she's going to have a baby. He laughs and says, \"You know, you might have found something that you know how to do.\" Months later Loretta receives a letter from Doo with enough money for the trip to Washington. The film skips ahead to Loretta's life in Washington. She's now the seventeen-year-old mother of four. Doo, who is now known as \"Mooney\" because of his moonshine days back in Kentucky, works as a logger. One night Loretta sings the children to sleep with a song about the sinking of the Titanic. Mooney listens intently. Afterwards, he asks what she'd like for her anniversary present. She reminds him she still doesnt have a wedding ring. Mooney goes to the local pawn shop to look for an anniversary present. He comes home late that evening drunk with a guitar for her gift. Even though she can't play it, he bought her a guitar because he likes the way she sings. While she sits on the front porch washing clothes in a decrepit washing machine, she picks out the chords and sings \"Have I Told You Lately That I Love You?\" As she improves, she makes her kids sit and listen and also sings while Mooney washes the supper dishes.\nMooney suggests they get a babysitter and go honky-tonkin'. On Saturday night they go to the local Grange Hall. Mooney seems to have something on his mind and Loretta thinks he must be going to finally give her a ring. Instead, Mooney talks to the bandleader about auditioning Loretta to sing with his band. When she realizes what her husband is doing, she runs to the bathroom. He follows and finally talks her into the audition. The next week Loretta is introduced as the new girl singer of the Westerneers. At first, she sings \"There He Goes,\" a song popularized by Patsy Cline, very timidly, but quickly loses her inhibitions and performs the song so well that the audience applauds lustily. While she is gardening one day, she makes up her first original song, \"I'm a Honky Tonk Girl.\" Mooney wants Loretta to cut a record, so they go to a small local recording studio. After she flubs a take, Mooney places the kids in the studio so she can sing to them like she does at home. After a few bars, the recording engineer stops the session to get more and better pickers because \"that little lady sings her hind end off.\" Back home, Mooney takes a publicity photo with their bedspread as the backdrop. After work, he stays up all night addressing envelopes with Loretta's photo and her record to country DJs. Mooney and Loretta don't have a telephone, so a neighbor comes to tell Loretta she has a long distance emergency phone call - her Daddy has died. Back in Kentucky for the funeral, friends and family sing \"Amazing Grace\" at the wake. It took Loretta quite a while to recover from her Daddy's death. Mooney finally convinces her if she wants to be a singer they have to see DJs in person to make certain they play her record. Grandma keeps the kids while they travel from station to station in eastern Kentucky. One of them claims to have received her record, played it and it flopped, but they find the envelope they sent unopened. She rants so vociferously, the DJ relents and plays it. On an interview segment a DJ tells her she has to pay her dues before she can sing on the Opry. Despite all the obstacles, \"I'm a Honky Tonk Girl\" becomes a hit. After an all-night drive, Loretta wakes to find they're parked in front of the Ryman Auditorium, the home of the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville. She's in awe. On her first appearance on the Opry, Ernest Tubb (himself) opens the show by singing \"Walkin' the Floor Over You.\" Loretta is scared; she doesn't think she belongs on such a prestigious stage; she hasn't suffered enough to be this far this fast. (The film shows a glimpse of two country music legends, Minnie Pearl and Roy Acuff, in the wings of the theater.) Tubb introduces Loretta who sings \"I'm a Honky Tonk Girl.\" After her performance, Tubb invites her to return the following week. After Loretta appeared on the Opry seventeen straight weeks, she sings \"I Fall to Pieces\" at Ernest Tubb's Record Shop in downtown Nashville. During an instrumental break, she dedicates the song to Patsy Cline, who made it a hit. She tells the listening audience that Patsy is in the hospital recovering from a car wreck. Afterward, Charlie Dick (Bob Hannah), Patsy's husband, meets them outside and tells Loretta that Patsy (Beverly DAngelo) would like to meet her. Loretta accompanies Charlie to the hospital and she and Patsy become bosom buddies. When Patsy returns to the Opry, she sings \"Sweet Dreams\" while Loretta watches from the wings. Later on Patsy's tour bus on the way to an appearance at a fair, Patsy sings a little of Kitty Wells' hit \"It Wasn't God Who Made Honky Tonk Angels.\" In the pouring rain, Patsy and Loretta sing a duet of \"Back in Baby's Arms\" while each holds an umbrella. After the show Loretta catches Mooney in the back seat of a car with a carnival floozie. She drags him out and threatens that she better never catch him with trash like that again. Later, on the bus she writes the song \"You Ain't Woman Enough (To Take My Man)\" about that incident. After a shopping trip with Patsy, Mooney and Loretta fight over her use of makeup (he doesn't like it and never has). Loretta hits his hand with her purse and then drives away with Charlie and Patsy. When Mooney comes home late, his hand is all bandaged. He's decided to get a job (he feels like a kept man and that was a serious male ego problem in the country community if not in the nation at large). She offers to quit if her being the bread winner is going to cause them to split. During their conversation, he finally gives her a wedding ring. Mooney gets a job as a mechanic in a garage where we hear Loretta sing \"You Ain't Woman Enough\" over the radio. Loretta visits Patsy and tells her she's pregnant again, but she doesn't want this baby. Patsy cheers her up by promising to give her the biggest baby shower in Nashville. Then Patsy gives her a box of her old maternity clothes. Patsy is leaving for a benefit performance in Kansas City, but she promises to call when she returns on Monday and they'll go shopping. Loretta wakes on Monday morning to the sounds of Patsy's voice singing \"Sweet Dreams\" on the radio. The announcer speaks over her singing and says, \"You're listening to a tribute to the late Patsy Cline, tragically killed early this morning in a plane crash near Dyersburg, Tennessee.\" In the next scene, Loretta has given birth to twin girls that she names Peggy and Patsy (of course, Patsy is named after Patsy Cline). Back on stage at the Opry, Loretta sings \"You're Lookin' at Country.\" As the song continues, she tours, writes songs on her tour bus, and signs autographs. The Opry announcer introduces her as having twenty-one No. 1 records. While she sings \"Sweet Dreams,\" Mooney drives his jeep up to their mansion in Hurricane Hills, Tennessee and later bathes the twins. While she sings \"You Ain't Woman Enough\" we see her touring again and spending lonely nights in hotel rooms. When the Opry announcer introduces her as the first lady of country music, she sings \"Your Squaw Is on the Warpath,\" while Mooney and the twins watch on TV. Her relentless schedule finally catches up with her. She's having throbbing headaches and medicine doesn't help. She wants Mooney on the road with her to take care of her. Out on the road again, Loretta sings \"Lovin' Country Style.\" Later, she can't remember the lyrics to a new song, \"One's on the Way,\" so one of her band members feeds the lyrics to her, but they soon give up and switch to the more familiar \"You Ain't Woman Enough.\" At her next concert, she doesn't want to go on, but Doo convinces her not to let her fans down. When she goes on stage, she doesn't come in after the band plays the introduction for her first song. Instead, she talks to the audience - her friends and fans and tells them that Patsy told her, \"you got to run your own life,\" but she feels like her life is running her. As she walks off the stage she collapses into her husband's arms (she suffered a nervous breakdown brought on by physical exhaustion and marital stress - her marriage miraculously survived).\nAfter her recuperation back at their ranch, she returns to the Opry and sings \"Coal Miner's Daughter,\" which is her very autobiographical song. That song segues into the closing credits which recaps scenes from the film. Further into the closing credits, we hear excerpts from \"One's on the Way,\" \"I'm a Honky Tonk Girl,\" \"You Ain't Woman Enough,\" \"You're Lookin' at Country,\" \"Fist City,\" \"Your Squaw Is On the Warpath,\" and \"Don't Come Home A-Drinkin' (With Lovin' on Your Mind).\""]},

He and his troublemaking childhood best friend Miles (Rafael Casal) work as movers and are forced to watch their old neighborhood become a trendy spot in the rapidly-gentrifying Bay Area. When a life-altering event causes Collin to miss his mandatory curfew, the two men struggle to maintain their friendship as the changing social landscape exposes their differences. Explores the intersection of race and class set against the backdrop of Oakland.", "In West Oakland, Collin Hopkins, a Black man who works for the Commander Moving Company as a mover, is a convicted felon on the last three days of his one-year parole. Among the many restrictions contained within his parole are living in a halfway house which has its own additional rules, having curfew, not being allowed outside of Alameda County, and no possession of firearms; contravention of any of these items could extend the length of his parole, or worse, send him back to prison. Collin, whose felony was largely a matter of unexpected circumstance, wants to do the right thing and lead a straight life. And despite having made it through the first 362 days of his parole, it isn't a guarantee that he will make it to the end clear, let alone make to the end at all due to the environment in which he lives, which includes people, like him, of a lower socioeconomic standing having to adjust to the gentrification happening within the community. One of the larger threats is his association with Miles Jones, his married best friend since they were kids and his moving partner. Miles, a Caucasian, feels like he has something to prove being white and living in West Oakland, something that Collin inherently doesn't have to prove being Black. But what could be the biggest threat to Collin is being haunted in witnessing a white police officer shoot a fleeing Black man to death in the back late in the evening of the third to last day of his parole--being shot for no reason by the police, something that Black people like Collin face every day. Through it all, Collin tries to negotiate his relationship with Val, his girlfriend before his incarceration and the dispatcher at Commander, who is taking more outward steps to improve her life to match that gentrification which may not include associating personally with someone like Collin, especially in light of having seen the aftermath of what sent him to prison.", "A Black ex-con trying to finish out his year-long probation witnesses a brutal police shooting, an incident that begins to haunt him and ultimately forces him to re-examine his relationship with his white best friend, a man who is known to be reckless and ill-tempered.", "Collin (Daveed Diggs), a convicted felon, is struggling to finish the last three days of his probation.

One of the more interesting topics of conversation centers on theatrical manager (aka talent agent) Danny Rose, who represents those who can't get better agents but who has always been committed to his clients. They talk most specifically about a rumored incident that took place approximately ten years ago, when Danny's most famous client was washed-up lounge singer Lou Canova, who had some minor fame in the 1950s and who was trying to make a comeback during an era when lounge singers were mostly seen as being hack performers. Despite being married with children, Lou was having an affair with brash blonde Tina Vitale, who Lou wanted at one of his performances. As such, Danny agreed to be a beard in being Tina's date.

Danny naturally obliges. However, Tina is also seeing a mob boss and when Danny is seen with her, the mob boss assumes Tina is two-timing him with Danny. This results in Danny and Tina being hunted by the mob. Adventures and hilarity ensue.", "In New York City, several veteran comedians bide their time at the Carnegie Deli, discussing the old days. Soon they are recalling theatrical agent, Broadway Danny Rose (Woody Allen), and his motley assortment of minor league talent, including a blind xylophone player, a one-legged tap dancer, a one-armed juggler, balloon folders, and a blonde-haired virtuoso of the water glasses. After trading stories about Danny's devotion to his clients, one of the comedians claims he has the greatest Broadway Danny Rose story, one involving Lou Canova (Nick Apollo Forte), a has-been, overweight Italian-American crooner with a big ego, a drinking problem and one hit song from the fifties.", "The comedian tells his story: Danny, who is devoted to his clients, attends Lou's nightclub performance and afterward is uneasy when the married Lou, who is saddled with alimony obligations from a previous marriage, purchases a single white rose from a flower shop for his mistress, Tina Vitale (Mia Farrow). Acquainted with Lou's wife Teresa (Sandy Richman) and their twelve-year-old daughter, Danny warns Lou against extra-marital affairs.

As Lou exercises on a treadmill to shed pounds, Danny works almost exclusively with him to prepare his performance, at the expense of his other clients. When Lou insists that he needs Tina at the performance to give him confidence, Danny considers it unwise because Teresa will be there.

Trying to convince Tina that her suspicions are unwarranted, Danny follows her to the home of her fortuneteller, Angelina, who urges Tina to resolve all her relationship problems.", "Acting on Angelina's advice, Tina makes an hour-long drive to a large estate in the suburbs, where her family and others connected to a crime organization have gathered for a party. Intent on settling old affairs, Tina meets with her ex-boyfriend, Johnny Rispoli (Edwin Bordo), who is unwilling to accept that their relationship is over and who, by stalking her, has learned about the single white roses she receives daily from her current lover. Presuming Danny is her new love interest, Johnny calls him \"Danny White Roses,\" but Danny insists he is only a theatrical agent.", "While continuing to urge Tina to attend Lou's performance, Danny tells Tina how he has nurtured Lou's career, by picking out his clothes and teaching him to budget money, and developing the way Lou tosses the microphone during a performance. When Danny demurs that he is not a Cary Grant in the looks department, Tina says she likes intellectuals and that he is a smooth talker. She adds that Angelina predicted that she would marry a Jew or someone musical.", "When Johnny captures the attention of the crowd and claims that Danny seduced Tina away from him, Danny and Tina feel compelled to escape from the party in Danny's car.

On the other side of the Hudson, Tina makes a call and afterward warns Danny to lie low in a hotel for a few days. Balking, Danny insists he must get his pills and other items, so she accompanies him to his apartment. There, she suggests decorating ideas, such as a bamboo motif and zebra skins, to lighten up the dreary place. To support her ambition to be an interior decorator, Danny quotes his Uncle Morris, \"the famous diabetic from Brooklyn,\" on the importance of confidence. Tina then shares her philosophy, \"See what you want, go for it,\" adding that one should \"do it to the other guy 'cause if you don't he'll do it to you.\" Danny says Tina's philosophy sounds like the screenplay to the film, Murder Inc. , and counters with the words of his Uncle Sidney, \"acceptance, forgiveness and love,\" which he calls a real philosophy of life.", "The Rispoli brothers eventually catch up and kidnap Danny and Tina and take them to a remote warehouse where floats and balloons for the Macy's Thanksgiving Day are stored. When the brothers threaten Danny with pistols, he protests that he is \"just a beard.\" Under duress, Danny offers up the name Barney Dunn as the real lover, because he knows that Barney, the world's worst ventriloquist, was scheduled to perform on a cruise ship and is therefore far from danger.", "When Danny and Tina are left alone, tied face-to-face to each other, they manage to wriggle loose, but as they leave the warehouse, they must dodge bullets fired at them. When a bullet hits a helium truck used to inflate the Macy's balloons, both the hit man's threats and the intended victims' pleas for mercy sound like the voices of cartoon characters.", "After escaping, Danny and Tina take a cab back to the theater to find Lou drunk backstage. At Teresa's request, Danny makes his special concoction for counteracting drunkenness and, completely cured, Lou soon sings \"My Bambina\" from the Waldorf stage.

After his successful performance, Lou confesses to Danny that he is signing with Sid Bacharach and has Tina's approval. Danny later learns that the Rispoli brothers beat up Barney Dunn, so he offers to pay Barney's hospital bills.

Because of his childhood, he has always tried to make meaningful emotional connections to other living creatures. That childhood includes not having a male role model with his father having been killed in the war, his overprotective mother smothering him, and an oppressive school system quashing his natural creativity. Being a rock star, he is often wanted more because of what he is than who he is. The most recent failure in that true connection to someone or something else is his marriage, when on tour, he discovers that his wife back home is cheating on him. His response is to go in the opposite direction, by building a figurative wall around him to isolate himself from the rest of the world, but not before showing graphically his feelings on different gut levels. The question becomes if he or anyone else can do anything to tear down the wall in a meaningful way.", "When his wife leaves him during a tour, the rock star Pink Floyd (Bob Geldof) becomes paranoid and mad, building a wall between the world in his mind and the real world. The process has begun during his childhood and loses his father in the war, missing him as a role model. His overprotective mother and the repressive education at school help to build the insanity process. Pink brings a willing groupie back to his hotel room, only to destroy it in a violent anger once she annoys him, scaring her away. Soon he suddenly regrets building the wall and becomes a violent fascist dictator, and his soldiers proceed to attack people. He then screams stop and goes on trial in his mind for what he has done, and then he finally tears down the wall as penalty.", "The film depicts the construction and ultimate demolition of a metaphorical wall. Though the film's symbolism is open to interpretation, the wall itself clearly reflects a sense of isolation and alienation.", "The protagonist (and unreliable narrator) of the film, Pink (Bob Geldof) is a rock star, one of several reasons behind his apparent depressive and detached emotional state. He is first seen in a quiet hotel room, having trashed it. The opening music is not by Pink Floyd, but is the Vera Lynn recording of \"The Little Boy that Santa Claus Forgot\". During the following scenes, it is revealed that Pink's father, a British soldier, was killed in action during World War II during Pink's infancy. The reference is almost certainly to the death of Roger Waters' real-life father, Eric Fletcher Waters, who died in combat in Italy during Operation Shingle (the Battle of Anzio) in February 1944. (\"When the Tigers Broke Free, Part I\"). The stampede of a modern rock concert is compared to soldiers running out of the foxholes to engage in combat (\"In the Flesh?\")", "The movie then flashes back to Pink as a young English boy growing up in the early 1950s. Pink longs for a father figure (\"Another Brick in the Wall, Part I\"). He discovers a scroll from \"kind old King George\" and other relics from his father's military service and death (\"When the Tigers Broke Free, Part II\"). One item he finds, a bullet, is placed on the track of an oncoming train, where he sees non-descript people riding the train. At school, he is caught writing poems in class and humiliated by the teacher who reads a poem (part of verse 2 of the song \"Money\"). It is revealed that the teacher is verbally abusive to the students because his wife is verbally abusive to him (\"The Happiest Days of Our Lives\"). Young Pink imagines a surrealistically oppressive school system in which children fall into a meat grinder. The children then rise in rebellion and destroy the school, carrying the teacher away to an unknown fate (\"Another Brick in the Wall (Part 2)\"). Pink is also negatively affected by his overprotective mother (\"Mother\"). Such traumatic experiences are represented as \"bricks\" in the metaphorical wall he constructs around himself that divides him from society (\"Empty Spaces\").", "As an adult, Pink eventually marries, but he and his wife soon grow apart. While he is in the United States on tour, Pink learns that his wife is having an affair (\"Young Lust\"). He turns to a willing groupie (Jenny Wright), whom he brings back to his hotel room only to trash it in a violent anger, terrifying the groupie out of the room (\"One of My Turns\"). After she leaves screaming, Pink goes into a deep depression (\"Don't Leave Me Now\"). After smashing the television with his guitar, he vows that he doesn't need \"anyone at all\" (\"Another Brick in the Wall, Part III\"). With that, he mentally completes the wall that he started building to protect himself from being hurt (\"Goodbye Cruel World\").", "Pink slowly begins to lose his mind to metaphorical \"worms\". He shaves off all of his body hair (an incident inspired by former bandmate Syd Barrett, who appeared at a 1975 recording session of \"Wish You Were Here\", having shaved his eyebrows and body hair) and, while watching The Dam Busters (1955) on television, morphs into his neo-Nazi alter-ego. Pink's manager (Bob Hoskins), along with the hotel manager (Michael Ensign) and some paramedics, break into the hotel room and discover Pink. They take him away into a waiting limousine outside the hotel and inject him with drugs to enable him to perform (\"Comfortably Numb\").", "Pink fantasizes that he is a dictator and his concert is a neo-Nazi rally. Nazi-Pink holds a rally, and looks for people who are different, \"queers\", \"coons\", dopers, and orders them \"against the wall\". (\"In the Flesh\"). His followers proceed to attack ethnic minorities (\"Run Like Hell\"), and Pink holds a rally in suburban London (\"Waiting for the Worms\"). The scene is intercut with images of animated marching hammers that goose-step across ruins. Pink then stops hallucinating and screams \"Stop!\" and takes refuge in a bathroom stall at the concert venue, reciting poems which would later be used as lyrics on Pink Floyd's \"Your Possible Pasts\" from \"The Final Cut\" album and \"5:11 AM (The Moment of Clarity)\" from Roger Waters' album \"The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking\".", "In a climatic animated sequence, Pink puts himself on trial (\"The Trial\"). He is depicted as a small pink rag doll that rarely moves. The judge is a giant pair of buttocks, with two backward facing legs, an anus for a mouth and a scrotum for a chin. The lawyer is a tall, menacing, vulture-like man and the schoolmaster is an abusive, hateful marionette. After hearing from the parties and witnesses (Pink's wife and mother), the judge orders the wall to be torn down. Following a prolonged silence, the wall explodes and shows a montage of events from the entire film, and Pink is last heard screaming. The film concludes with three children cleaning up a pile of debris after an earlier riot (\"Outside the Wall\"). It is unknown whatever has happened to Pink, leaving the viewer to decide."]},

H.I. distracts Smalls, enduring a horrendous beating in the process, but discreetly removes a pin from one of the many grenades strapped to Smalls' vest.

Overjoyed at his son's return, and finding no harm done to him, he offers Ed and H.I. the posted reward, but they refuse it. As Nathan Sr. watches them admire the baby, he deduces that they are his kidnappers as well as his rescuers. However, he is sympathetic to their wishes to have a child of their own, and encourages them not to give up on their marriage or their dream of having a family. Asserting that there is no need to call the police, Nathan Sr. allows the McDonnaughs to leave.", "That night, H.I. has a dream which seems to give glimpses of both the near and distant future: Gale and Evelle, realizing that they are not yet ready to enter society again, return to prison via the same tunnel they escaped from. Glen has no luck trying to convince people that H.I. and Ed had kidnapped the Arizona baby, and gets into trouble after telling an offensive joke to a police officer.

An elderly husband and wife, living in a trailer much like the McDonnaughs', welcome their many children and grandchildren for a holiday dinner. H.I. tentatively hopes that such a future may become a reality for himself and for Ed."]},

Walt and Billie intend to continue to search for Chris until they know conclusively what has happened to him. Carine, having had much the same upbringing as Chris, believes she understands what he is doing in making this escape. What he has done is either donated most of his money to Oxfam or burned it, and has destroyed all of his ID in an effort to start life anew as a child of the Earth, he rechristening himself Alexander Supertramp.

Twenty-eight years later, the initial welcome by the human population has faded. The refugee camp where the aliens were located has deteriorated into a militarized ghetto called District 9, where they are confined and exploited in squalor. In 2010, the munitions corporation, Multi-National United, is contracted to forcibly evict the population with operative Wikus van der Merwe in charge. In this operation, Wikus is exposed to a strange alien chemical and must rely on the help of his only two new 'Prawn' friends.", "The film opens with a documentary-style series of interviews that introduce the story: twenty years prior, an alien ship arrives above Johannesburg, South Africa. It hovers above the city for three months without any contact; eventually humans take the initiative and cut into the ship. They discover a large group of aliens who are malnourished and sick. The aliens are later assessed as being \"workers\", with their leadership mysteriously missing (it is hypothesized that a plague may have wiped out all of the leadership-caste). Grainy footage shows part of the ship (supposedly a command module) falling to Earth, but nobody has been able to find it, leaving the ship still hovering but inoperable.", "The creatures are given permission to leave their craft and live on Earth but are housed in a squalid government camp consisting mostly of dilapidated one to two room shacks. The alien race's true name is never learned; they are primarily referred to as \"prawns\", a derogatory term referring to the bottom-feeding sea creature they resemble or, more rarely, \"non-humans\". Overcrowding and militarization eventually turn the area into a slum known as District 9. A massive black market is set up between the aliens and a group of Nigerians primarily led by Mumbo, a paraplegic warlord. In addition to inter-species prostitution, the Nigerians exchange canned cat food for alien weapons, of which the cat food has an effect similar to catnip on the aliens.", "The present story takes place in 2010. Patience over the alien situation among the human population of Johannesburg has run out and control over them has been contracted to Multi-National United (MNU), a private company that shows little regard for the aliens' welfare. MNU's actual agenda is their interest in the aliens' advanced weaponry, but its integration with alien biology makes it useless to humans.", "An MNU field operative named Wikus van der Merwe (Sharlto Copley) is tasked with moving 1.8 million aliens to a new camp, District 10, located 240 km from Johannesburg, with help from private security forces working for MNU. MNU teams serving warrants for the relocation of the aliens find caches of contraband items, including weapons, in many alien shacks. Wikus himself oversees several inspections and is assisted by Koobus Venter, a belligerent MNU military operative whose tactics with the aliens are ruthless and cruel. In another shack, not far away, an alien named Christopher distills a mysterious black substance that has taken him 20 years to find the components for and stores it in a small black cylinder. While serving and eviction notice to Christopher, and searching his shack, Wikus finds the cylinder which squirts its contents into his face. He becomes almost instantly nauseous and collects the device as evidence.", "Wikus returns to his office and grows increasingly ill throughout the day, the side-effects of the black fluid becoming more prominent. He returns home that evening and collapses at a surprise party in his house. He is rushed to a hospital where a doctor discovers his left arm has metamorphosed into that of a prawn's. Wikus is then taken into custody by MNU, the cylinder is confiscated, and a series of tests and experiments are performed on him. Most surprising to those studying him, is that his DNA has been altered to the point, that he can operate the alien's weapons with both his alien hand, and human hand. The scientists discover that his DNA is currently \"in balance\" with the alien DNA, which is gradually transforming him completely into a prawn. With the permission of Wikus' ruthless father-in-law, they decide to harvest his body for biological material at this critical point, to see if they can figure out how to get the same reaction in other human subjects later on.", "However, during the attempted vivisection, Wikus overpowers his captors and escapes, fleeing from MNU. Attempting to return home, he finds MNU agents already there. Making his way across the city, he is shocked when an all-points bulletin is put out for his capture, with doctored footage showing him having \"interacted\" with the aliens in an unsavory way. With nowhere else to turn to, Wikus finds refuge in District 9.", "Wikus returns to Christopher's run-down shack where he finds the alien's small son. It is hinted that Christopher might be a surviving member of the prawn leadership caste, as he shows much more knowledge of how alien technology works, possesses or at least found the command module, and interacts with MNU officials more articulately than other aliens.", "Looking around inside, it, Wikus is shocked to find that hidden under the shack, is the mother ship's command module. Christopher explains to Wikus that the cylinder he took, was the power source that could power the module to return to the ship...where the prawn explains there would be technology to reverse the man's current mutation!", "In order to get the cylinder back from MNU, Wikus steals some alien weaponry from Mumbo and his gang, with Mumbo vowing to capture Wikus and eat his mutated arm (his witch doctor believes this will give him the power to operate the alien weaponry). With Christopher's help they launch an assault on MNU and successfully retrieve the fuel cylinder. While there, Christopher discovers that MNU has been conducting horrific experiments on his people, before he and Wikus fight their way back to District 9.", "However, after seeing what the humans are doing to his race, Christopher's priorities have changed, with him claiming that Wikus' cure will take three years, while he (Christopher) attempts to find a way to seek help for the other Prawns in Johannesburg. Furious, Wikus knocks Christopher unconscious and powers up the ship himself. The MNU mercenaries target Wikus and destroy one of the command module's engines, causing it to crash land inside District 9.", "After Wikus is captured by MNU, a battle between the MNU mercenaries and Mumbo's gang breaks out. After a protracted firefight, the Nigerians capture Wikus. Just before Wikus' arm is chopped off, Christopher's son (using the command module controls) activates several systems in the mothership, including the autopilot routine of a mechanized battle suit; it slaughters Mumbo and his men after they fire on it. Wikus enters the alien walker battle suit, and after initially attempting to flee, returns and rescues Christopher. Armed with a lightning cannon, tracking missiles, and a high-powered machine gun, Wikus begins to fight the MNU men. After being knocked over by an anti-tank sniper round, he convinces Christopher to return to the shuttle without him, over Christopher's objections. Christopher promises Wikus that he will return in three years to repair his body. Christopher then boards the shuttle and activates a tractor beam which returns the command module to the mother ship. The mother ship powers up with a loud, rolling boom and flies off. On TV, humans cheer as the ship leaves Earth.", "Wikus' battle suit is hit in the back and the suit ejects him. Wikus, heavily wounded, begins dragging himself away from Koobus Venter, the sole survivor of an MNU squad, but is quickly caught. As he prepares to shoot Wikus, other prawns appear, attacking and dismembering Venter.", "The film concludes with another series of interviews and news broadcasts, providing human opinions on the events that unfolded. The aliens are successfully moved to District 10, which now has a population of 2.5 million and is growing. One of Wikus' coworkers hacks MNU's database and publicly exposes their illegal genetic experiments. There are many differing theories on Wikus' fate. Some people believe that he either left on the mother ship, is in hiding, was captured by MNU or a government agency. Some interviewees hypothesize that the aliens are planning to return with a full army and declare war on humanity. An interview with Wikus' wife reveals a small metal rose was left on her doorstep (Wikus has earlier demonstrated his affection for his wife with similar handmade gifts). Her friends have told her that it could not have possibly been Wikus, but she appears unsure.", "In the final scene, an alien with a bandaged left arm is shown in a junk yard, fashioning a rose out of scrap metal."]},

Bugs tells Sam to cover his eyes while he puts on his bathing suit, then proceeds to turn the board around to put Sam on the diving edge. Bugs makes some sounds that suggest that he has taken the dive, even giving an audible \"SPLASH!\", then Sam turns around and walks off the edge of the board and into the tank below. When Sam crashes in, the hoops break off the tank causing it to fall apart, but the water remains intact.", "On Sam's next attempt to get Bugs to dive, Bugs springs so hard on the board that he sends Sam up and over Bugs' head, separating him from his pistols in the process, then down toward the tank. At that moment, Bugs realises that he forgot to fill the tank with water, so he gets a bucket of water and uses it to throw the water down from the diving board past Sam. The water lands in the tank, but Sam misses the tank completely and smashes through the stage into the basement.", "The next time Sam walks to the end of the board, he finds Bugs standing on the board upside down and asks him \"Great horny toads! What are ya doin' down there upisode-downy?\" Bugs replies \"I'm not upside down, doc. You are! Look!\" When Sam looks \"up\", he sees the tank, and then falls into it.", "Sam then tries hitting Bugs verbally with \"fightin' words\", which leads Bugs to dare Sam to step across a line that he traces on the edge of the board. When Sam steps over the line, he is sent down towards the tank again, but rises up long enough to say to Bugs \"I hate you!\" before falling again.", "When Sam gets back to the top again, he finds himself stopped by a door that Bugs has placed on the board. Sam yells at Bugs to open the door, then after banging on it, he turns to the audience and says \"You notice I didn't say `Richard'?\". Sam backs up and charges at the door, and at the last moment, it is opened by Bugs, who gives Sam an anvil as he passes through that helps him on his way to another splash after his momentum sends him off the board.", "Sam returns to the platform at the top and finds himself in a setting that looks like a desert. Dressed like an American Indian, Bugs says to Sam \"Quick! Him go that way! You take-em short cut! Head him off at pass!\" Sam thanks the disguised Bugs, takes the way that he suggests, and dives off the board once again.", "We then see Sam starting to climb the ladder twice before diving back into the tank as the result of unseen setups. Finally, Sam is sure that he is going to make Bugs dive when he has the rabbit tied up and standing on the edge of the board while Sam saws away at the platform, gloating \"Now ya smarty-pants, let's see ya get out-in this one! This time, you're a-diving!\", but when Sam finishes cutting through the board, it is the ladder and platform that fall, leaving the cut plank with Bugs standing on it suspended in mid-air. Bugs turns to the camera and says, \"I know this defies the law of gravity, but, you see, I never studied law!\" The cartoon then ends by irising to the middle."]},

As Oliver's problems get worse, Millicent is increasingly quick-tempered because the plans for the party are not going smoothly. As the time for the dinner approaches, it appears that the hosts and the guests all have plenty on their minds.", "One week before her next society dinner, Millicent Jordan receives word that Lord and Lady Ferncliffe, whom she and her husband Oliver, a New York shipping magnate, had met in England the previous year, have accepted her invitation. Overjoyed by this social coup, Millicent is oblivious to Oliver's lack of enthusiasm about the dinner and her daughter Paula's preoccupation about the impending return of her fiancé, Ernest DeGraff, from Europe. While Millicent fusses about finding an \"extra man\" for her single female guest, former stage star Carlotta Vance, Oliver faces distressing news about his shipping business, which has been struck hard by the Depression. After Carlotta, a former lover of Oliver who resides in Europe, confesses to Oliver in his office that she is nearly broke and is interested in selling her stock in the Jordan Shipping Line, Oliver is visited by Dan Packard, a rough-talking, nouveau-riche mining magnate. Oliver confides in Dan about his financial struggles and asks him to take over some of his stocks until his business improves. With blustering hesitation, Dan agrees only to consider Oliver's proposition, then goes home to brag to his brassy, gold digger wife Kitty that the Jordan Line is a valuable asset that he is going to devour through crooked stock purchases. Unknown to Dan, however, Oliver has convinced Millicent to invite the Packards to her dinner, and the ill-mannered but socially ambitious Kitty eagerly has accepted. Although he at first refuses to go, Dan, who believes that he will soon be appointed to a Cabinet post, changes his mind about the dinner when he finds out that the Ferncliffes, the richest couple in England, are also invited. Also unknown to Dan, one of Millicent's other guests, Dr. Wayne Talbot, has been having an affair with Kitty while pretending to be tending to her feigned illnesses. On the eve of her dinner, Millicent, still short an extra man, telephones Larry Renault, a washed-up silent movie star, and extends him a last-minute invitation, completely unaware that Paula is having a clandestine love affair with him. At Paula's urging, Larry, a three-time divorcé and hardened alcoholic, accepts the invitation, but advises the much younger Paula to forget about him and return to Ernest. After Paula stubbornly refuses to take Larry's admonitions seriously, she is seen leaving his room by Carlotta, who is residing at the same hotel. Later that evening, Larry is visited by his agent, Max Kane, who tells him that the stage play he was planning to star in has lost its orginal producer. Max breaks the news to Larry that the play's new producer, Jo Stengel, wants another actor in the lead but is willing to consider him in a bit part. Although crushed, Larry agrees to think about the offer, then desperately sends a bellboy to pawn a few of his possessions and buy a fresh bottle of alcohol. The next day, Talbot is discovered by his wife Lucy in a compromising telephone call with Kitty and confesses that, in spite of his love for her, he is addicted to women and needs help to overcome his weakness. Talbot then is rushed to see Oliver, who has come to the doctor's office with severe chest pains. Although Talbot tries to hide his prognosis of terminal thrombosis of the heart, Oliver wisely deduces the seriousness of his illness. When he returns home, the weakened Oliver tries to explain to Millicent his need for rest, but she is too hysterical to hear because, among other minor disasters, the Ferncliffes have cancelled and are on their way to Florida. Although anxious to tell Millicent about Larry, Paula, too, is turned away by her upset mother and faces the prospect of facing Ernest alone. At the Packards, meanwhile, Kitty reveals to Dan in a fit of anger that she is having an affair. When threatened with divorce, however, Kitty tells her husband that, if he wants his Cabinet appointment instead of a career-stopping revelation from her about his crooked dealings, he must back down from his takeover of Oliver's line and treat her with more respect. Just before he is to leave for the dinner, Larry is visited by Max and Stengel and drunkenly berates Stengel for insulting him with his paltry offer. After a frustrated Max denounces him for ruining his last career chance and the hotel management asks him to leave, Larry quietly turns on his gas fireplace and commits suicide. At the ill-fated dinner, Carlotta confides in private with Paula, who is just about to break her engagement with Ernest, about Larry's demise and counsels the young woman to stay with her fiancé. At the same time, Millicent learns from Talbot about Oliver's illness.

Sam Deeds is the local sheriff who is called to investigate a 40-year-old skeleton found in the desert....As Sam delves deeper into the town's dark secrets, he begins to learn more about his father, the legendary former sheriff Buddy Deeds, who replaced the corrupt Charlie Wade. While Sam puzzles out the long-ago events surrounding the mystery corpse, he also longs to rekindle a romance with his old high-school flame. Sayles' complex characters are brought together as the tightly-woven plot finally draws to its dramatic close.", "Sam Deeds is the Sheriff of Rio County, TX and to some extent, he lives in the shadow of his late father, the venerated former sheriff, Buddy Deeds. Sam had always had a difficult relationship with his father, especially during his teenage years when Buddy absolutely forbade him to see a pretty Hispanic girl, Pilar Cruz. Local mythology has Buddy Deeds, when only a sheriff's deputy, murdering the corrupt and violent sheriff of the day, Charlie Wade. When Wade's remains are found in the desert, Sam finds himself investigating his father and slowly peels away at the story from the perspective of its long-term residents including a local bar owner, Pilar's mother and the current mayor. What Sam learns shows his father in a different light and has a direct impact on his own life choices.", "In the small Texas town of Rio County, a body is found and on it is a Rio County Sheriff's badge. Now the consensus is that the body is Charlie Wade, the Sheriff who terrorized and shook down most of the minorities during his time. One day he just disappeared. Now some people suspect that one of his deputies, Buddy Deeds, who stood up to Wade killed him and buried him. He would succeed Wade as Sheriff and be extremely revered. Now the current Sheriff is Deeds' son Sam, who didn't exactly have good relationship with his father, so he's leaning towards his father killing Wade.", "The film opens with a couple of men out in the desert. One of them is admiring the local flora while the other is sweeping the area with a metal detector. We learn later on that they're a pair of off-duty sergeants from a base nearby that's due to close in about three years, and this particular chunk of desert was the army's rifle range many years ago. They stumble over a human skeleton and, shortly after the police arrive, they also find a Rio County sheriff's badge and a Masonic ring.", "We are in Frontera, Texas, a border town in Rio County. Sam Deeds is the sheriff here in Frontera. Sam was born here but left as a young adult. He returned two years ago and was elected to the position. Sam's late father was the legendary Sheriff Buddy Deeds, who is beloved by the town, remembered as a unique individual with a great sense of fairness and justice. And Sam's mother is repeatedly referred to as a saint. As a teenager Sam had problems with his father, and the pair routinely argued and fought, so these glad-handing descriptions aren't really helping him.", "Sam brings in Texas Ranger Ben Wetzel to help with the case. Wetzel tells Sam that forensics identify the skeleton as that of Charlie Wade. Wade was the remarkably corrupt and cruel sheriff who preceded Buddy Deeds. Back in 1957, Wade mysteriously disappeared, and as they investigated the issue, they discovered that $10,000 in county funds were missing. So the popular theory then was that Wade took the money and ran. But now Wade's body has turned up and not far from home, for that matter. Based on the story from Mayor Hollis Pogue, who along with Buddy was a deputy sheriff under Wade, Buddy sounds a lot like the prime suspect because the last time anyone saw Wade alive, it was on a night when Buddy refused to help Wade with collecting his grift. And, it turns out, the two sergeants were searching for old bullet casings and one of those casings came from a .45 caliber gun, not something you typically find on a rifle range. Given that the police carry .45's, this is more evidence pointing to Sam's father as the trigger man.", "Now, Hollis and a local business leader named Mercedes Cruz are working hard to have the local jail replaced by a new and larger facility. And Sam thinks that it's a waste of taxpayer money. In fact, he views it as a kind of log-rolling grift to put money into people's pockets. Over time, we learn that when Sam was a teenager, he was in love with Mercedes's daughter Pilar, but the courtship was strongly opposed by Buddy and Mercedes. When Pilar's son is arrested for a petty crime, Sam runs into her by chance and gets him released from jail. And though he's been in town for a couple of years, this is the first time Sam has seen her since he left town. They begin to see each other casually from this point.", "Mercedes is rather a complicated woman. She owns a local restaurant, and she hires immigrants to work there, insisting that they speak English because, as she says, \"We're in America now.\" She also owns a property that turns out to be close to the river, so it's a common place for illegal immigrants to cross through, and she's not above calling the Border Patrol to turn them in.", "Meanwhile, in another plot line, Colonel Delmore Payne has recently arrived in town as the commander of the local Army base. Delmore is coincidentally the son of Otis \"Big O\" Payne, a local nightclub owner and leading figure in the African-American community. Big O is to the African-Americans what Buddy was to everyone else. Otis and Delmore are estranged because of Otis's serial womanizing and abandonment of Delmore's mother when Delmore was a child.", "During Sam's investigations of the events leading up to Wade's murder, he learns more about Wade's terrible ways. In addition to his monthly extortion of the local businesses, Wade would also kill people who didn't cooperate with him. He'd ask his victims if they carried any weapons, and when they answer in the affirmative, he asks to see those weapons, so he can justify shooting them for \"resisting arrest\". Back in the late 1950s, Wade used this method to murder, in front of then-Deputy Hollis, Mercedes' husband, Eladio Cruz, having discovered he was running an illegal smuggling operation in Rio County without bribing Wade.", "Sam also uncovers secrets about his father's nearly 30-years as sheriff that suggest that Buddy himself had some corruption going on. He visits Wesley Birdsong, a Native American and a roadside tourist stand owner, who reveals that Buddy was a wild young adult after his service in the Korean War but settled down after becoming a deputy sheriff and marrying Sam's mother; but he reveals that Buddy did have a mistress, whose name Wesley claims to have forgotten. Sam travels to San Antonio, where he visits his marginally mentally ill ex-wife Bunny and searches through his father's things, where he discovers a bunch of documents, including old bills and love letters from Buddy's mistress. Otis tells Sam that Buddy's focus was on the county political machine while Wade's focus was on money. The janitor at the sheriff's office tells Sam that he worked on Buddy's home while incarcerated in the local jail. A local reporter uncovers that Buddy forcibly evicted residents of a small community to make a lake that made Frontera a popular tourist destination...and Buddy and Hollis became the owners of lakefront property.", "One of Mercedes' employees turns up in her back yard. It turns out that he's been assisting some of the illegal immigrants and one of them was injured during the river crossing. The woman is the mother of his son; she learns that the woman he married was a marriage of convenience but now he's bringing the woman he loves over to the US. Mercedes is going to call the Border Patrol again to get them to bring her to a hospital, but changes her mind and takes them to a local doctor who owes her a favor.", "Sam confronts Hollis and Otis about Wade's murder, thinking he has all the details to pin it all on his own late father. But it's not quite what he thinks. Wade discovered Otis was running an illegal gambling operation at the nightclub, after he had previously warned Otis against running numbers in the club. Wade was mostly upset not that the gambling was going on, but that he wasn't getting his cut. So in a flashback scene in which we hear none of the dialogue, Wade violently attacked Otis, ordered him to hand over the monthly extortion money, and then was about to use his \"resisting arrest\" setup to kill Otis. Buddy arrived just as Hollis shot Wade to prevent Otis's murder. The three of them then buried the body, then took the $10,000 from the county. They gave the money to Mercedes-who was left destitute after Eladio's death at Wade's hands-to allow her to buy her restaurant. Hollis also reveals that Buddy and Mercedes did not take up until sometime later. Sam decides to drop the issue, saying it will remain an unsolved mystery. Hollis voices concern that, when the skeleton is revealed to be Wade, people will assume Buddy killed him to take his job, to which Sam states that Buddy's a legend; he can handle it.", "Pilar meets Sam at an old drive-in theater where Sam shows her an old photo of Buddy and Mercedes and tells her Eladio didn't die a few months before she was born, it was 18 months. Between the documents he found and the photo, we realize that Buddy is Pilar's father, making them half-siblings. Both are hurt over the deception but decide that, since she cannot have any more children, they will continue their romantic relationship."]},

Prospero questions her and tells her that she must decide whether her father or her husband will die. Alfredo (Patrick Magee) comes up, remarking what entertainment this is for him and how innocent the girl is. Prospero promises that soon he will corrupt her and calls for Francesca to make a decision. ", "\nA scream is heard and a guard sent to see about it. When the scream continues, Prospero goes himself. In a hut the guard is stunned. Prospero asks what it is, and the guard can only point and tell him to look. The old Grandmother has broken out with the Red Death (red spots on her face). ", "\nReturning to the others, Prospero questions whether the three had any contact with the woman. When he determines they did not, he tells the guards to take the two men to the castle and he will take the girl. They are loaded up and Prospero tells the guards to burn the village. Gino questions why and Prospero tells him it is his deliverance. ", "\nAt the palace Prospero orders invitations to those whom he wants to attend his feast. Francesca is stripped by maidens and thrown into a hot bath. Prospero enters with Juliana (Hazel Court) and orders the maidens out. Francesca covers herself in modesty. Prospero questions why and asks whether the cross she wears is ornamental or symbolic of her faith. She attests to being a true believer and he orders her to remove it and never wear it again in the castle. He tells Juliana that after her bath to clothe Francesca in her finest gowns. Francesca asks about her father and Gino and is told they are being quartered. Prospero leaves and Juliana assures Francesca that she has not made a good impression on him. Francesca asks if Juliana will do as Prospero has told her. She replies that she will do as he says, as they all must. ", "\nAt the feast, Alfredo tells a woman he will tell her about terror. Prospero, overhearing, asks what he knows of terror. He calls him away into another room. Everyone follows. He questions whether terror is hearing the sounds of time ticking away as he walks past an antiquated clock. He suggests terror may be the sound of a heartbeat in fear or the sound of footsteps approaching. ", "\nHe introduces dancers Esmeralda (Verina Greenlaw) and Hop Toad (Skip Martin) who will entertain. Musicians enter playing and a dwarf, a young girl and a long-haired dog. As Esmeralda dances, Alfredo approaches Prospero, asking about her. Suddenly the girl knocks over a wine drink. Alfredo slaps her and she falls. Hop Toad begins to draw his knife, but upon seeing the anger of Prospero and Alfredo, he instead comes to raise up Esmeralda. Prospero leads Alfredo away, claiming the first act has disappointed but then throws wine in the face of Alfredo, who threatens him. Prospero then tells everyone they are lucky to be in the palace and safe from the Red Death which will spread the countryside. ", "\nHe invites everyone to a masquerade ball the following day at midnight, offering costumes to everyones use. He advises them not to wear red. ", "\nFrancesca enters in a white gown and is introduced to everyone by Prospero. First she is introduced to Señor Veronese (Julian Burton), who is told to act like a pig. He gets on the floor and rolls around as everyone laughs at him. Next Prospero calls for Señor Lampredi (Brian Hewlitt) to become a worm on the floor. He crawls around to everyones amusement. Prospero calls for Señora Escobar (Gaye Brown) to play a braying jackass. Señor Rivoli (Harvey Hall) is told to ride the jackass. Prospero tells everyone else to act like animals. Francesca is horrified. ", "\nAs Francesca is led away by Prospero into private quarters, Alfredo looks on with desire. In a yellow room Prospero tells her that his father once imprisoned a man there for three years. When the man was freed, he no longer could look at the sun or a daffodil. Prospero tells her that it was a test to control a mans mind. ", "\nIn a purple room he tells her that he doesnt believe in God; if God existed He must have died long ago. He believes someone or something exists in His place. Francesca believes in love and the goodness of God. ", "\nBefore they go into another room Prospero tells her she is not ready to enter that room. He tells her to rest from her long day. He promises her that the next day she will see Gino and her father. ", "\nProspero, roaming the castle later, is confronted by Juliana, who tells him she is ready to enter the deeper ceremonies which he believes in. He laughingly suggests that she is only ready because she wants to secure her position. ", "\nIn her room Francesca is awakened by the sound of wind. She goes over to a sconce that has gone out. As she turns back, she sees blood on a book and screams. Next she hears Prospero chanting in Latin. Putting on her robe, she goes out to investigate. She goes downstairs, following the sound of his voice. Entering the yellow room, she goes through the purple room and finds the door open to the next room. She goes through it into a black room where she sees Juliana and a raven cawing. Seeing Prospero lying in a coffin looking dead, she goes to touch his face. At that moment he opens his eyes and she screams and runs away. She is startled by Alfredo who is wearing a mask. ", "\nThe next day Prospero shows Francesca a falcon which kills another bird. He tells her it is trained by blinding its eyes until it becomes a slave to its master. He says that God blinded people with the cross and that he serves a different master. She begins to say that he forced her to remove her cross because it offended him. He interrupts her, saying that it offends no one following his master. He felt that it was discourteous to wear the symbol of a dead God. He confesses his master is Satan, Lord of Flies, the Fallen Angel and the Devil. ", "\nHearing a horn blowing, he tells her to come. Going to the battlement, he looks down as a carriage arrives. Scarlatti (Paul Whitsun-Jones) demands entrance to the castle as an invited guest. Prospero tells him he is no longer welcome due to the Red Death. He begs for sanctuary and offers up his wife to the Prince. Prospero informs him he has already had that doubtful pleasure. Begging for Prospero to spare him from the Red Death in the name of friendship, Scarlatti receives an arrow below the throat. Prospero throws down a dagger for the wife to kill herself with. ", "\nIn the dungeon, a sword is thrown down before Gino, who is told to learn to fight. He refuses to fight his friend. A swordfight ensues. Prospero and Francesca enter and witness the fight. When Gino wins, he tells Prospero that he will not fight his friend. Prospero promises torture, but Gino tells him that that would be considered losing. Intrigued, Prospero promises that after some thinking he will match the two together in a death fight. ", "\nWalking through the dungeon, Prospero tells Francesca that sometimes life is cruel. She winces at the sound of a man in pain. She asks if Satan requires torture in his worship. He tells her of a Christian monk many years ago who tortured men, women and children in order to save their souls. He blames this on God. He promises to lead her into the ways of Satan. She refuses. ", "\nJuliana prays and offers herself to Satan, branding her chest with an upside-down cross and asks to be made into a demon. ", "\nAlfredo has a conversation with Hop Toad, who desires to serve someone other than Prospero. He promises his talents if Alfredo will take him in. Hop Toad persuades him to come to the ball in the costume of an ape which he will provide. Alfredo is pleased. ", "\nFrancesca hears someone trying to get into her bedroom door. She rises and stands aside as the door opens. Juliana comes in and Francesca sees the brand on her chest, asking if Prospero did it. Juliana admits she did it herself, marking her as a handmaiden of Satan. She tells Francesca that there is one more ceremony where she gives her soul to the devil to be immortal. She is hoping to be bound to Prospero and that Francesca would be out of the way. When Francesca tells her she would love to escape, Juliana gives her a key to the cell and urges her to free Gino and her father and escape. ", "\nFrancesca wanders through the dungeon, passing several men in the throes of torture. Finding the cell with Gino and her father, she frees them. As they pass the guard room, one of the guards sees someone go by and goes to check. A fight ensues with Gino, Ludovico and two guards. Coming out onto the battlement, Gino calls to a guard who turns to face him. It is Prospero, who calls out his guards. Francesca tells him that Juliana betrayed them. Prospero tells her Juliana betrayed him and that one of the two men must die for their sins. ", "\nAt the party, people are seated at long tables as waiters bring platters of food. Dancers and musicians perform. Prospero stands and calls for their attention. He announces that at midnight the masks will go on. He states that some among them still harbor good thoughts. He calls for the next entertainment to come in. Gino and Ludovico come in and stand before him. He throws down five daggers, one of which he says contains a poison that kills in five seconds. He tells them to each cut themselves with one of the daggers. Ludovico goes first, followed by Gino, then Ludovico again and Gino. The final dagger is taken by Ludovico, who tries to stab Prospero across the table with it. Ludovico is stabbed by a sword and falls dead. Prospero calls for them both to be killed since the game was not done correctly. Francesca begs for Ginos life. Prospero announces that he will not kill Gino, but release him so that he can die of the Red Death. Taunting Gino about his God, Prospero asks where his God is now. Gino says he will meet Him in paradise. The command is given to release him and Gino swears he will somehow return for Francesca. ", "\nFrancesca tells Prospero to allow her to go with Gino, which he refuses. Then she says bring him back and she will submit herself to whatever he wishes. At this point Juliana calls from across the room, telling the Prince that she is ready for the final ceremony. ", "\nGino is cast out of the castle and runs through the forest. The sounds of Prosperos fiendish laughter and the screams of Francesca are heard on the wind. As he stumbles on, he sees the Man in Red sitting under a tree, playing Tarot cards. Asking how it is going, Gino confesses that he has killed and that he is afraid for Francesca and afraid of Prosperos castle. The Man in Red gives Gino one of his cards as a sign. Gino takes it and returns to the castle. ", "\nMeanwhile Alfredo is trying on the ape costume. Hop Toad directs him as how to walk slumped over and swinging his arms. He tells Alfredo that he can remove the costume once the unmasking is done. ", "\nGino finds a group of villagers heading for the castle to ask forgiveness and receive sanctuary. One woman is carried on a stretcher with the Red Death. Gino tries to stop them but is pushed aside. ", "\nJuliana begins her ceremony, chanting at the altar. She drinks ceremonial wine drugged with hallucinogens. In the dreams she runs through hazy corridors and then finds herself on an altar. She is horrified to see five different men who wield weapons over her. ", "\nWhen she comes to, she hears the laughter of Prospero and calls out to him. Searching from room to room, she tells him that she is now betrothed to the devil. He says there are more horrors to come. In the main room, she approaches the swinging pendulum and hears the voice of Prospero telling her that her fears have just begun. At this point she is attacked by one or more ravens that leave her dead and bloodied on the floor. ", "\nOne woman finds her and cries out. Prospero approaches with the other guests and tells the woman not to grieve for Juliana, for she has wed the devil. He calls for the masquerade to begin. ", "\nOutside, the villagers arrive and call for mercy. They are told to return to Catania. One guard is sent to fetch Prospero. Gino tries to dissuade the elders from groveling before the Prince. They refuse. Prospero comes out and tells them to go back where they came. When they refuse, he commands his archers to slay them. ", "\nInside, Prospero throws jewels down to the people, who scramble to gather them. He tells Francesca that all of these rich people suffer from greed and are desperate for more riches. Then he tells them to rejoice because the remaining villagers are now dead. He has promised all inside his castle will be safe from the Red Death. He tells Francesca that soon she will be initiated into understanding. Prospero and Francesca are seen dancing with the others. ", "\nGino climbs the castle walls with a makeshift rope he has made from vines. At the battlement he sees the Man in Red, who tells him to wait until one oclock at which time Francesca will be sent out to him. Gino is anxious to rescue her but is told to be wise. When he is shown a dead guard, he looks back and the Man in Red has vanished. ", "\nHop Toad enters the room of Esmeralda and tells her to be ready to leave the castle later when he comes for her. She tells him that she trusts him. ", "\nAt the party, Hop Toad and the ape make their appearance. Hop Toad cracks his whip, telling everyone that he controls the ape. As the ape seizes a woman and falls to the floor with her, Hop Toad unties a rope holding up a light fixture of candles and lowers it just above them. Citing that the ape is out of control, Hop Toad ties him to the candle fixture and lifts him up in the air. Alfredo complains and demands to be released but Hop Toad tells him he has insulted Esmeralda too much and deserves to pay. Dousing the ape with brandy, Hop Toad sets him on fire. As the party goers look on, their laughter changes to screams as the ape burns. The fixture collapses and Prospero calls for the guards to remove it. Hop Toad leaves the room and Prospero calls for a reward to be given to him. ", "\nAcross the crowded dance floor, Prospero sees the Man in Red. Telling Francesca that he commanded that no one should wear red, he follows through the different rooms. In the black room, he is confronted by the Man in Red (whose face is covered). Prospero tries to guess who it is, saying the voice is familiar. Suspecting that it is the devil himself, he makes Francesca bow down. Prospero calls for the man to show his face but is told that he will only see it upon his own death. He tells Prospero that the unmasking will reveal everyones faces soon. ", "\nLeaving the room, the Man in Red calls for a new dance to begin. Prospero follows. With each wave of his hands, the Man in Red spreads the Red Death to those at the party. Prospero is pleased and remarks that he led all these friends to Satan and corrupted them for him. He asks that Francesca be spared and the Man in Red tells her to go to the battlements. Prospero tells her that he will join her when this is over. ", "\nProspero addresses the Man in Red, who denies being the devil. He says that he is death. Prospero insists that his own pact with Satan will save him. The Man in Red says that it will not. Prospero removes the mask to see his face. He is horrified to see his own face, made red from the Red Death. Prospero is then taken by all the guests who jostle him around the room. As the people begin to collapse from the Red Death, Prospero is the only one left standing. He retreats to the black room, hoping to escape from a horrible death. In that room he finds the red-cloaked figure, who strikes him with the Red Death. ", "\nThe Man in Red is seen playing cards with the young girl from the village. Several other men arrive and give reports of the deaths of many. The Man in Red tells them that only six survived: one man and woman, a dwarf and small lady and the girl from the village."]},

A narrative by an older Ruth reveals that their grandfather, as a boy, came to Fingerbone looking to visit the mountains; a luxury train crash occurred in Fingerbone which later killed him. Ruth and Lucille are dropped off at their kindly old grandmother's house, a cozy and quite large place constructed by their grandfather. The girls' mother then leaves and never returns.", "Ruth and Lucille spend time talking with a nice police officer and the elderly friends of their grandmother, as the police officer tries night and day to locate their mother. Meanwhile, their mother parks the car in a private field, and requests that three passing boys aid her in getting it unstuck from the mud. The boys kindly offer to help, but are shocked when she insists that they use a beautiful plaid blanket and a good autumn coat to wedge under the tires in order to get the car unstuck. When they finally do, the mother offers the boys her purse, and the boys, thinking she is offering them money as a return for their help, take it, only to then watch in horror as she drives straight through the field and over the edge of a large cliff, sinking into the lake. This lake is the same lake where all the deceased passengers of the luxury train, including Ruth and Lucille's grandfather, drowned in, their bodies mostly never recovered.", "Ruth and Lucille grow up with their grandmother, never being told that their mother died by suicide in the lake. In fact, after their grandmother's funeral, they skate on the lake's frozen ice with a number of other schoolchildren, oblivious to it. Lucille barely remembers her mother, while Ruth has vague memories, trying to hold onto her family by clinging to her grandmother's old photographs hidden in a small box in a drawer near the floor. They continue to live in their grandparents' house with two elderly great aunts, both of whom are paranoid about the cold weather and detest living in Fingerbone. Although the great aunts are kind-hearted and treat the girls well, Ruth and Lucille feel out of place, having grown up with old people for years and knowing no other children their own age.", "The much younger, ditzy and eccentric Aunt Sylvie, stops by to see the girls. As Sylvie is taken to peculiar rituals such as eating with the lights out, hanging around with hobos at the train station, and wandering around outdoors at odd hours, Ruth and Lucille take an instant liking to her as a person closer to their age range, and also as their mother's sister. After the two elderly aunts move away and leave the girls in Sylvie's guardianship, the girls begin to ask many questions about their mother; Sylvie is uncomfortable about this, and refrains from breaking the news to either of the girls that their mother died by suicide. Sylvie is perpetually cheerful, except once, when Lucille hounds her with questions about pregnancy and Sylvie's absent husband; she tells Lucille that some questions are impolite and should not be asked, although she does mention that her husband was a soldier in the Pacific War; a domestic violence situation is implied that Sylvie fled from.", "At first, Ruth and Lucille fear that Sylvie will leave them, but Sylvie decides to stay. A disastrous flood hits the house, destroying most of the objects on the lower floors (including many of the grandmother's photos, much to Ruth's upset), but they quickly get the house cleaned up, putting the sofa out on the lawn to dry and scraping mud from the porch and walls. Sylvie shows the girls some old wallpaper that their mother wrote on, as well as the mountain paintings that their grandfather did. The house takes on a visibly dirty appearance though, and as Sylvie's eccentric habits take root there, it quickly falls into a state of squalor. Sylvie has a particular affinity for animals, and cats and dogs quickly fill the face. The sofa, now dingy and sun-faded, remains on the lawn. The white picket fence collapses, the bush surrounding the house becomes overgrown, and Sylvie's hoarding leads to stockpiles of old newspapers and tin cans being kept.", "Ruth and Lucille initially see this as a kind of rebellion, taking advantage of the fact that Sylvie's absent-minded eccentricity allows them to ditch school every day, since they both hate going. Embarrassed by their dated, well-worn clothing, the girls find solace by the lake, spending hours there every day near the train bridge, reading and playing. As this goes on, however, and the school fails to notice that they're missing for the entire semester, the novelty quickly wears off. Lucille mentions that she can't wait to go to Boston, hoping that escaping to a big city will get her out of Fingerbone. Ruth dreads the thought of Lucille leaving, and doesn't see the point in trying to. That summer, when the girls catch Sylvie walking straight past them as she searches for them, they realize that she may be mentally ill. This is further suggested when she behaves recklessly atop the train bridge. The girls, believing she is going to jump, tell her that everybody will think she's committed suicide. Reminded of the girls' mother, Sylvie assures them that this was not the case, although again, she hasn't got the heart to mention to them that their mother died by suicide. It is hinted at that Sylvie had run away years ago from the family homestead to marry her (now-estranged) husband, leaving her sister, and that both women went separate ways in their adolescence. Her sister, the more proper of the two, led a more conventional life as the mother of Ruth and Lucille after leaving for the big city until her suicide. Sylvie simply stops speaking of her after a certain point, taking on a more sisterly role than a motherly one with Ruth and Lucille.", "After Sylvie is found sleeping on a park bench with a book on top of her face, Lucille becomes more and more embarrassed by their aunt's quirky behavior. She chastises her for talking to \"trashy\" people down at the train station, and finds that she cannot fit in with any of the preppy girls she knows in town. When Ruth and Lucille both return to school, this is only heightened further. Ruth refuses to style her hair or wear appropriate clothing, and during a trip into town, when the girls stop at a soda fountain and Ruth won't speak or look anybody in the eye, Lucille begins to take notice that her older sister is beginning to exhibit the same odd and subversive behavior as Sylvie. Lucille, wanting to fit in with a circle of girls from school who use sewing patterns, makes an effort to sew a two-piece for school, but refuses to concede to the fact that she doesn't know how to sew because she missed the offered home economics class during the semester that she ditched school. She instead blames Ruth, angry that Ruth has used the dictionary with sewing terms in it for pressing flowers.", "Lucille and Ruth become increasingly distant. Upon returning to school, Lucille puts down Ruth in front of the principal, and when Ruth still refuses to make an effort to fit in, Lucille abandons her entirely. Lucille begins to dress like the preppy girls, stays in a clique (while never inviting any of them over to the house after school), and chooses to eat in her bedroom, avoiding Ruth and Sylvie at any cost. Ruth, lonely and desperate for the companionship with her sister she once had, makes repeated attempts to talk with her, to no avail. Instead, Ruth becomes closer to Sylvie, reveling in her eccentric whimsy and chaos.", "Lucille attends her first school dance, wearing a stylish silver gown with gloves and a pink ribbon. Upon returning home, she is disheartened to find that while Ruth is studying, the house is still a mess and Sylvie is asleep with a book covering her face. Lucille tells Ruth, \"somebody should really cover that up\" (pointing to Sylvie) before fleeing; she goes to her home economics teacher's house, claiming to be homeless, after which she is taken in by the teacher and moves away completely, disassociating herself from her aunt and sister. Depressed, Ruth opts to start ditching school again, and goes with Sylvie to the lake to visit a secret house on a deserted island across from Fingerbone. The pair steal an angry fisherman's canoe and row across the water, in a trip that takes up the whole day. Sylvie shares that she has seen small children living on the island they are visiting, but Ruth secretly doubts this.", "Upon arriving at the island, Sylvie shows Ruth the collapsing remains of an old house with nothing in it but an old Singer sewing machine. It is implied that the house was there when the train bridge was being built, but was abandoned when it no longer became convenient to live so far away from town. Ruth watches for the children that Sylvie claims to have seen, concluding that she \"feels\" them there like Sylvie does, even if she can't see them. The pair roast marshmallows over an open fire, and by the time they row home, it's already the middle of the night.", "Lucille wishes to speak to Ruth after school the next day, wondering why she didn't attend for an important test. When Ruth suggests they talk at the drugstore, Lucille, not wanting to be seen with her, goes to the lake with her instead. She urges Ruth to leave Sylvie, but Ruth refuses, insisting that the trip to the island the previous day was perfectly safe. Unbeknownst to her, Lucille tells her teacher, who then calls the police. A police officer arrives and, concerned for Ruth's well-being, sends his wife and two women from church to the dilapidated house for a visit. The women are horrified by the spectacle; one woman winds mushrooms growing in a dead potted plant, another woman nearly sits on a large pine cone that's been brought into the house, and piles of newspapers block the windows. The women are even more disturbed when Sylvie innocently remarks that she can see the girls' mother in Ruth. They urge Sylvie to give up her niece to a new guardian, and later on, the police officer returns, declaring that there will be a hearing to determine Ruth's guardianship the next day.", "Sylvie and Ruth know that Sylvie will never be able to hold up to the standards of a proper guardian if she's examined in a courtroom. They work instead on dressing Ruth properly, styling her hair, and burning all the old newspapers, as well as a racy sex book that Ruth had in the house. They then go to play a game of hide and seek, but unfortunately for them, the police officer arrives and takes Ruth's absence to mean that she is missing. When Ruth finally does appear, the police officer urges her to come back to his house where she can stay with him and his wife, but she refuses, choosing to stay with Sylvie.", "Unprepared for the court hearing, Sylvie and Ruth light fires all around the house to burn it down, packing only two small suitcases as they flee. Knowing that they'll be caught, Sylvie insists that they'll have to walk across the lake on the train bridge rather than waiting with the hobos until morning. Despite Ruth's fear that they might both fall into the lake or be hit and killed by a train, she follows Sylvie as Sylvie promises that another train won't be coming until morning. The ending is left ambiguous as the pair cross the tracks, with only a voice-over by Lucille from earlier in the film remarking that Sylvie is always running away."]},

When his love of music lands him an assignment from Rolling Stone magazine to interview the up-and-coming band Stillwater -- fronted by lead guitar Russell Hammond and lead singer Jeff Bebe William embarks on an eye-opening journey with the band's tour, despite the objections of his protective mother.", "William Miller is a 15-year-old kid hired by Rolling Stone magazine to tour with and write about Stillwater, an up-and-coming rock band. This wonderfully witty coming-of-age film follows William as he falls face-first to confront life, love, and lingo.", "The story opens with William Miller (Michael Angarano), living at home with his mother Elaine (Frances McDormand) and his sister Anita (Zooey Deschanel) in San Diego, California. While William gets along well with his mother and sister separately, both of the women in his life are at odds with each other. Elaine struggles to keep some form of control over Anita, who feels that her mother is too overbearing and controlling.", "During this time, it is revealed to William that his Mom skipped him ahead 2 grades, as all his classmates around him are 13, and he's 11. William's life also is thrown for a loop when his sister Anita decides to leave home to become a stewardess, in order to escape from her Mom. After she leaves, William finds that Anita has left him her record collection.", "Her collection ends up having a major impact on William. By the time he turns 15, William (Patrick Fugit) has become interested in rock music and journalism, writing for several underground newspapers, and Creem Magazine, edited by one of his idols, famed rock writer Lester Bangs (Philip Seymour Hoffman). One day, William encounters Lester in San Diego, and the two discuss rock music and journalism. Even though Lester claims the industry is destroying the genre and rock journalism is not a stable thing, he sees a determination in William to succeed, and requests he interview Black Sabbath, who are set to play at the San Diego Sports Arena.", "William attempts to get in, but is rebuked by the doorman at the arena. Unsure what to do, he meets a group of girls who call themselves Band-Aides. William is introduced to their leader, Penny Lane (Kate Hudson), who explains their philosophy, of how they are not groupies but are there to support the music.", "Shortly thereafter, William manages to get into the arena when he meets the opening act for the night: the band Stillwater. Complimenting them on their sound and musical talent, they invite William to join them backstage. During this time, William ends up interviewing them, with the bulk of the interview coming from member Jeff Bebe (Jason Lee). William ends up watching the concert from side-stage, as the band opens for Black Sabbath, performing the song \"Fever Dog.\"", "After the show, Lead guitarist Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup) invites William to meet them at the Continental Hyatt House in Los Angeles, and tells William that they'd like Penny Lane to come along. William informs Penny and as they exit the sports arena, she gives him her contact information, and tells him of her life's goal: she plans to live in Morocco for one year.", "A few days later (unknown to his mother), William sneaks off to Los Angeles with Penny, where they meet up with the band at the Hyatt House (nicknamed 'The Riot House'). It is here that William sees there may be some chemistry going on between Russell and Penny. He also is introduced to Polexia Aphrodesia (Anna Paquin), and Vic Munoz (Jay Baruchel).", "A few days later, William gets a call from Ben Fong-Torres (Terry Chen) of Rolling Stone magazine. William disguises the fact that he's 15 years old, and pitches his voice lower. Fong-Torres compliments him on his work, and asks William about any bands he'd like to cover. William suggests Stillwater, and soon joins the band on the road, traveling with the Band-Aides on the band's bus (named Doris), much to the horror of his mother, who fears that this will interfere with his school work & derail Williams' future.", "Along the way, a number of incidents happen to which William is privy:", "-Jeff Bebe gets into a heated row with Russell when the band's first t-shirts arrive, and Russell is the only recognizable person in the band while everyone else is out of focus. The argument is indicative of the problems that have been plaguing the band for an indeterminate time - Russell feels his talent has allowed him to grown beyond the band's limits and Jeff feels Russell is overshadowing his bandmates.", "-Following the argument, Russell and William end up at a house party in Topeka, KS, where he drops acid and climbs up on a rooftop, proclaiming to be a 'golden god.' (Moments later he jumps off the roof into the swimming pool.) William calls Dick, who comes to the house & convinces Russell to return to the band. Back on the tour bus, the tension between the band members and their entourage is palatable but they all seem to reconcile when they sing Elton John's \"Tiny Dancer\" together. William tells Penny he still has to go home and she sweetly tells him \"You *are* home.\"", "-The record company sends a renowned band manager named Dennis Hope (Jimmy Fallon) to replace their current manager, Dick Roswell (Noah Taylor). The band is apprehensive, but give in to Dennis' grand plan for the band to make more money, turning them away from their philosophy of playing 'for the fans.' Dennis is also instrumental in adding more tour dates, getting the band better treatment from concert promoters and stage managers, and the band ditches their beloved tour bus 'Doris' in favor of an airplane.", "As the tour winds down, William is able to interview almost everyone, but still is not able to get his key interview with Russell. What should have been a simple task becomes mind-numbing, as William is swept up with the tour, causing him to field questions from Ben Fong-Torres about the story, and rousing the ire and worry of his mother (who in one of her classes, proclaims: \"rock stars have kidnapped my son\"). One night while he talks to his mother, Russell seizes the phone from William and tries to reason with Elaine, who immediately cuts through Russell's charm and lectures him on being more responsible, however respectfully. Russell is somewhat shaken by the conversation.", "At one of the stops, William is privy to a poker game, in which Dick and Russell wager Penny Lane and the Band-Aides in a game without Penny or the girls knowing. The girls must leave the tour before they arrive in New York where Russell's wife will meet the band. The band Humble Pie ends up \"winning\" them, and pays Dick and Russell $50 and a case of Heineken beer. William tries to put this out of his mind, but upon hearing how Penny seems to have stepped over the line of supporting the band and fallen for Russell, tells her about the bargain Russell and Dick struck. The news has a devastating effect on Penny, however she takes it good-naturedly at first, asking \"What kind of beer?\" she & the girls were wagered for.", "The girls do not accompany the band to New York, but upon getting to the hotel where the band is staying, William runs into Vic, who tells him that Penny Lane is staying at the Plaza Hotel, under the name Emily Rugburn.", "William then gets a call from Jann Wenner, chief editor of Rolling Stone and Fong-Torres, telling him that the band will grace the cover of their next issue, and that he is permitted to share this news with the band.", "At a restaurant in New York, this news is met with enthusiasm by the band. However, Russell's girlfriend, Leslie (Liz Strauber) sees Penny in a nearby corner watching Russell. Dick goes over to talk with Penny, who rushes off. William takes off after her and finds her in the Plaza Hotel, where she has overdosed on Quaaludes. William manages to keep Penny conscious until the doctors get there, and after pumping her stomach to get the pills out, Penny and William go for a walk through Central Park, where she tells William the story behind her real name, 'Lady Goodman,' proclaiming that he now knows 'all her secrets.' After their stroll, William takes Penny to the airport, where she flies home to San Diego.", "William joins the band on the plane as they fly to a new venue. Everyone questions where William went in the middle of dinner the previous night -- he missed meeting Bob Dylan -- but he is hesitant to tell them what happened. Suddenly, the plane is caught on the edge of a storm, violently shaking everyone around. Feeling like the plane may crash or break up at any moment, everyone begins to reveal secrets. Dennis reveals that he once hit a man with a car and kept on driving, not taking responsibility for the accident. Dick reveals that he took more money than his regular fee, claiming 'he knew he earned it.' Jeff reveals that he slept with Dick's wife after they broke up, and also slept with Leslie. Two more in the band also reveal they slept with Dick's wife. Jeff, in a moment of rage at Russell, reveals his true anger at Russell, and tells Leslie that Russell had been sleeping with Penny. William, angered at how the band treated Penny, finally tells them what happened to her, and proclaims his love for her. Ed Vallencourt (John Fedevich), who has been silent for some time, comes out of the closet.", "After Ed speaks, the plane makes it through the weather, and everyone stays silent, not speaking for the remainder of the flight. When the plane lands, Russell tells William, that he can write whatever he wants in regards to the band.", "Exhausted, William reports to Rolling Stone's headquarters in San Francisco, armed with his notes, but still without his key interview with Russell. The editors are astonished to see that William is so young and their fact-checker rants about his notes, saying that they're so disorganized that she'll have a difficult time doing her job. William asks for a single night to finish the piece, and calls Lester Bangs, who tells him to be honest and truthful, suggesting that William shouldn't have allowed himself to befriend the band.", "The story that William types reveals everything, including Russell's 'golden god' speech and the airplane confessions. Once the band is contacted by Rolling Stone's fact-checker (Erin Foley), the band denies 90% of the story, and William is sent back to San Diego. At the airport, he runs into his sister Anita. Anita offers to take William on an adventure to anywhere... but the only place he wants to go is home. Anita joins William and they go to their home where Anita and Elaine reconcile and William crashes in his own bed.", "Sometime after, as Stillwater is going their separate ways, one Band-aide whom Penny knows named Sapphire (Fairuza Balk) meets up with Russell, chastising him for what happened to Penny as well as his ruining Williams' story. Nearby, some new groupies are mingling with the band. Sapphire comments how the new girls are not really fans, seeing as they don't love the music, are only into sex without birth control & selfishly eat the best food the caterers offer.", "After talking to Sapphire, Russell is compelled to call Penny and apologize, requesting to meet her. Penny gives him an address, but it is not until he arrives there that he realizes she has given him William's address. Russell first meets Elaine, whom allows him to talk with her son after telling him sternly that William is a fine young man and a trustworthy friend. Talking with William in his room, Russell explains that he retracted his statement to Rolling Stone, confirming that the story was true. William then takes the opportunity to get what he never could before: a one-on-one interview with Russell about what he loves about music. Russell eagerly agrees and tells William that he loves \"everything\" about music.", "The film then ends with a montage of different clips that play over Led Zeppelin's \"Tangerine\": Stillwater goes back on tour, with their old bus 'Doris' as their main mode of transportation (with their 1974 tour called the 'No More Planes Tour'). Russell and Bebe have reconciled. William sits down to breakfast with Anita and his mother, who have also reconciled. Finally, we see Penny at an airplane ticket counter, fulfilling her decision to go to Morocco."]},

As they follow the leads through Bree's call girl world, they know they're getting close to finding the truth when someone continues to torment Bree.

But Simone's playing a dangerous game, and when George agrees to help her, they both end up in deep trouble with Mortwell (Sir Michael Caine), the local kingpin.", "After serving seven years in prison, the small-time criminal George is released. He seeks out his daughter, but his ex-wife does not let him talk to her. His friend Thomas meets him and gives back his Jaguar that he kept for him, and explains the new reality when George is impressed with how the neighborhood has changed. George is hired by his former boss Mortwell to work as the driver and bodyguard of high-class call girl Simone. In the beginning George is a misfit for the position, and does not get along with Simone, but gradually he befriends her--and falls in unrequited love with her. Simone looks for someone on the streets of the King's Cross district (London's red-light district in the 1980s) and asks George to help her to find the prostitute Cathy. George is involved with the underworld of prostitution and is chased by the dangerous pimp Anderson. When he finds Cathy, he discovers how Simone is connected to her.", "George is fresh out of prison. Because he has not betrayed his clients or his cronies from before, he thinks they owe him something. His ex-wife wants nothing more to do with him and keeps their daughter away from him. He finds accommodation in the garage of his friend Thomas and gets a job as a chauffeur in the company of his former boss Mortwell. Mortwell is a big player in the local red-light scene and gives George the job of driving the high-class call girl Simone from one john to the next. Simone, with her manners trained on fine customers, and the straight-laced, somewhat plain George first have to get along. But slowly George gets to know and appreciate the person behind the role of the high-class prostitute. Simone takes advantage of George's affection to hire him for a job: For a long time Simone has been looking for her missing friend Cathy, who has slipped into even darker corners of prostitution because of her drug addiction. George asks around on the streets and finds out that his boss Mortwell has something to do with Cathy's disappearance. When he finds Cathy, he is finally caught in the mobsters' crosshairs.", "George has just been released from prison, and manages to get a job driving an expensive call girl from customer to customer. Initially they don't get along, and he doesn't fit in with the high class customers Simone services. Will they ever get along?", "Under the opening titles, we see a man crossing a bridge in London carrying a package. He stops off at a florist and picks up a bouquet. When he arrives at his destination, a rowhouse in a lower-class neighborhood, he knocks on the door. A teenage girl in a school uniform answers the door, but the encounter is swiftly interrupted by her mother, who comes out shouting and cursing at him. He responds in kind, and by the time she's closed the door on him for good, a crowd has formed in the street. The man nearly gets into a fight with one of the neighbors, but another man pulls him out of the whole thing.\nThe man's name is George, played by Bob Hoskins. The teenager is his daughter Jeannie, played by Zoe Nathenson, and the man who rescued him from the fight is his best friend Thomas, played by Robbie Coltrane. Thomas has been keeping in touch with George, largely through sending him mystery novels. George complains that in some of them it's far too easy to figure out who the murderer is, and often posits alternate, better solutions to the stories. We learn over time that George is a low-level gangster who has been in jail for seven years, and it's likely that he went up because he took the heat for someone else's deeds. That \"someone else\" is Denny Mortwell, a big-league player in the local prostitution scene, and he's played by Michael Caine. Because George took that heat, however, he thinks that Denny owes him something, so he spends some time looking for Denny, but apparently he's out of the country at the moment. However, he's given a job to do by one of his capos. He's to be the driver and bodyguard for what we can only assume is a very high-priced call girl named Simone, played by Cathy Tyson. Simone is very hostile to George at first, and it may be because he's rather uncouth and outspoken, and he's hostile to her because he thinks she's putting on airs. She gives him money to get a decent outfit, and the clothes he picks out are no better than the ones he had on previously. Later on they go out shopping for something more suitable. We see a friendship start to grow between the two, but it's still somehow guarded on her side. Occasionally, between jobs, she has him drive to King's Cross, which is one of those areas where the hookers openly solicit customers. As they drive through, she appears to be looking for something, but she doesn't say what. At one point George notes that a couple of the girls are his daughter's age, and when one girl approaches him and he turns her down, she begins to abuse him verbally until her pimp shows up. From his car seat, George beats up the pimp and they drive off.\nLater, in her apartment, Simone tells him why they keep going down to King's Cross. In her past, she was one of the girls down there. She had a pimp named Anderson, who would beat her regularly. She had a single friend down there, a young girl named Cathy, who also worked for Anderson. She'd promised to take care of Cathy, but at one point she took the opportunity to escape. She ran away to Brighton and discovered a whole other level of clientele. When she returned to London she realized that these bigger fish also existed there, so she began working on her own, though Denny was finding the clients for her. But she's haunted by the fact that she left Cathy behind and keeps looking for her, knowing that the lifespan of a girl at King's Cross is likely to be limited, especially when they're working for a guy like Anderson. She enlists George's help to find Cathy, reasoning that he'd have an easier time moving through that part of town.\nGeorge meets up with Denny and Denny gives him a little lecture on the nature of happiness. He then says that what makes him happy are the small details in life. To that end, he wants George to find out what Simone does when she's with her clients, presumably as a means of blackmailing them or otherwise using the information as leverage.\nIn between all of this, George has occasional encounters with his daughter Jeannie, by picking her up at school and driving around a little bit, talking with her before dropping her off near her home. Jeannie has no idea why George disappeared for seven years, but she's eager to have him back in her life. George keeps drawing mental parallels between Cathy, who's about Jeannie's age, and Jeannie, and thinks about what could have happened while he was away. And in the meantime, he's increasingly torn between his loyalty to Denny and his affection for Simone. At one point he literally asks her what she does with a client, and she tells him that they drink tea and do nothing else. To underscore the lie, she has someone take a couple of Polaroid pictures of her serving out tea and has them sent to George while he's waiting for her. When George reports back to Denny that she's having tea and actually has photographic proof, Denny gets furious at him and tells him to get his head back in the game.\nNow, in between his chauffeuring jobs, George also delivers packages for Denny to various places in the red-light district, so he's been looking for Cathy on the sly. At one point he thinks he's getting close to her but it turns out to be another teenager who bears a superficial resemblance to Cathy. George tries to \"rescue\" her but is unsuccessful. On another delivery trip, he spots a porno tape and tries to buy it, but the owner just gives it to him. When he gets an opportunity, he plays the tape and his suspicions were right: it's Simone in the video, giving oral sex to a man. George confronts Simone about the video and she confirms that the man in the video is Anderson. He's played by Clarke Peters.\nAnderson tracks Simone down to her apartment, and tries to slash her, cutting George's arm instead. They manage to get away from him and he stashes her in Thomas' place, which is basically a secluded garage where he works on cars and deals in buying and selling various knickknacks. Because Thomas can get stuff, George asks him if he can procure a gun.\nGeorge then goes out and locates Cathy at Denny's house. He takes advantage of a hidden door to sneak her away from her client, but she's badly addled by heroin. It's clear that she's deeply addicted to the stuff. He takes both girls to a hotel in Brighton, and Cathy is in the early stages of withdrawal. Simone sends George to a pharmacy for some drugs to help Cathy, and he gives her the gun, just in case.\nLater on, he and Simone go for a walk on the boardwalk. Early on, they get into an argument but he finally gets the whole story out of her: Simone and Cathy aren't just good friends, they're lovers. Suddenly Simone spots Anderson nearby on the boardwalk and the chase is on. Eventually George manages to get away from both Anderson and his henchman, but they know where everyone is staying, so he knows that they won't be safe for long. In fact, it's not long after they get back to the hotel that the gangsters catch up with them. A fight ensues and Simone winds up shooting both of them dead, but then in the heat of the moment she points the gun at George. George is infuriated and strikes her, then takes the gun and leaves.\nSometime later we see George, who's now basically free of his obligations to whatever remains of Denny's organization, and Thomas working together under a car, when we see a pair of female feet walk up. It turns out to be Jeannie, who's still rebuilding her life with her father. The two of them walk out of the garage, chatting happily."]},

The genre's durability can be traced to three of our deepest American desires - to be in show business, to get rich quick, and to share and express our deepest feelings. We meet several of the \"songwriters\" - from an elderly woman to a young African-American man to a small-town Iowan with big-time dreams - each of whom has been in the \"business\" for awhile, churning out odd compositions that cover the waterfront of American obsessions, from Jesus to genitalia, from politics to Elvis. We also meet the producers (often known as song-sharks) who hold out the tantalizing promise of fame to their eager customers, and the has-been musicians who sit in studios, day after day and year after year, interpreting some of the weirdest lyrics ever written. Through fellow musicians and his son, Ellery Eskelin, one of the most eloquent fans of song-poem records, we learn about the life and tragic death of the man aficionados consider the greatest song-poem interpreter of all time, Rodney Keith Eskelin. Using a variety of stage names, this would-be classical composer brought an eerie beauty to many of the song-poems he recorded before ending his career and life by jumping onto a Hollywood freeway. As filmmaker Meltzer says, \"The beauty of song-poems is that they are a result of the intersection, or collision, of ordinary people's expressions and the desires of musicians/businesses to make a quick buck, making the music as fast as they can, usually in one take. When those two forces combine, they create strangely compelling songs that are unlike anything you've ever heard.\" Shocking, funny and heart-wrenching all at once, OFF THE CHARTS is a fascinating look at one of the strangest subcultures in our American landscape."]},

Guy points out that the altimeters are not accurate enough to fly at such low level without crashing. But later Gibson is watching a show in London and the spotlights focusing on the star on stage give him the answer. Lights are mounted in the nose and tail of each Lancaster bomber and set to converge on the ground at 60 feet.

For such an old film the dam bomb bursts are well done. The Lancs take turns making their runs. One fails to pull up and its bomb goes over the dam wall, exploding under the plane's tail.

The remaining bombers fly on to the Eder dam, where their success is repeated, and back at base the group waiting around the phone celebrates wildly as the news of the raid's success comes through the morse-beeping phone.

She's happy to accompany him - but then she sees through the game. However by this time he already learned to like her, so he follows her home. Will he manage to win her heart despite their differences?", "Prologue: Greyhound bus headed for San Francisco. Seems to be the heyday of the Haight-Ashbury scene. We meet a limping, grizzled Birdlace (River Phoenix): he chain smokes, doesn't eat much as we hear the week's numbers from Vietnam on TV: 141 dead, 391 wounded, 47 missing. Back on the bus, as Birdlace daydreams through the window, a flashback begins. Most of this movie is presented in one long flashback.", "Act I: November 1963; the Four B's (Birdlace, Burzin (Richard Panebianco), Benjamin (Mitchell Whitfield) and Bueller (Anthony Clark), a.k.a. Okie) are going on a last night of liberty before shipping out for Okinawa. Bonded by bullshit and macho posturing, they have an \"elite\" event planned - the eponymous 'Dogfight' - that everyone seems to want in on, even officers. Each goes \"hunting\" for a date to bring to this event; it is soon evident they are to bring the most unattractive girl they can find; the winner gets a jackpot.\nAfter striking out with several prospects, Birdlace steps into Rose's Coffee Shop to get out of the rain. He is desperate, and for just a beat seems to consider the old lady seated near the door. Rose Sr. (Holly Near) is cold to him but he hears Rose Jr. (Lili Taylor) trying to learn the guitar chords for Malvina Reynolds' \"What Have They Done to the Rain?\" He strikes up a conversation full of nonsense, especially about the imaginary Jim Swain and his great influence on Bob Dylan as co-writer of most of Woody Guthrie's songs. Rose knows her stuff and isn't buying it, but is warm to Birdlace anyway. After hesitating, she agrees to go as his date to \"a party.\"\nRose gets sick at the Dogfight, so Birdlace wins the consolation prize. As she is cleaning herself up in the rest room, she overhears an argument between Burzin and his date, Marcy (E.G. Daily). Marcy has \"won\" the dogfight for Burzin and is fighting with him over her share of the jackpot - it turns out she was hired, not found. Rose questions Marcy and learns the truth of this event; Rose then slaps and slugs an inebriated Birdlace as he sits on a bar stool and gives him a verbal lashing as well - even to the other Marines who seem overwhelmed by her ferocity. With tear-smeared makeup, Rose then takes refuge in her room - her folk music world - listening to Joan Baez sing \"Silver Dagger.\"", "Act II: Birdlace deals with his own dogfight - the large German shepherd in Rose's back yard - to put a note on her window - an apology and an invitation to dinner. She accepts but on her terms - if there's any more dogfight, she'll kill him. He declines what appears to be a Polish or Ukrainian restaurant saying \"We can do better.\" They end up going into an elegant establishment with string quartet and tuxedoed wait staff, and are denied entry because Birdlace has no dinner jacket. Now on a mission that binds them, they roust an elderly clothing store couple out of bed to get Birdlace a jacket, which he wears proudly with price tag still hanging from the collar, to get a seat at the restaurant. After dinner, as they walk, he throws the just-purchased jacket from an overpass into traffic below.\nScenes jump from Birdlace and Rose to the other B's enjoying their liberty in a much different fashion - getting tattoos (bees, of course) and being serviced orally by an arcade hooker as they watch Russ Meyer's The Immoral Mr. Teas. At one point, in a Chinatown tattoo parlor, Burzin sees Birdlace walking with Rose but does not let on to the others - he senses there is something important going on there.\nRose and Birdlace argue about their differing approach to life - one a pacifist, the other a soldier who sees change resulting from shooting. Nonetheless there is a deepening bond between them.\nRose takes Birdlace to the Still Life Cafe, where she hopes to sing one day. When she writes to him, she wants him to know what she's talking about. While there, he asks her to sing the song she was singing earlier in the coffee shop, which she does, reluctantly. This simple, quiet version of the entire song (\"What Have They Done to the Rain?) sums up all that is going on in the world at the time as well as with both of them personally.\nBirdlace then takes Rose to an arcade - the complete opposite of The Still Life - where they play Whack-a Mole to Rose's delight. Knowing that music is important to her, he then takes her into a special room full of music machines. He drops coins into all of them which soon results in a cacophony - but a charming one, like a magic carnival. Finally there is only one large music box playing and they dance slowly, awkwardly kissing - perhaps the first kiss for both of them.\nIn spite of his macho banter, use of profanity and willingness to use a girl in a dogfight, Birdlace is actually very courteous and thoughtful. Arriving back at Rose's place, he does not push himself on her - but is glad when she asks him in. He asks if it's OK before he touches her or removes some of her clothing, and having recently viewed the films about STDs in boot camp, is sure to get out a condom (he hides it under her teddy bear as she puts on a robe in her closet). Rose has actually invited somebody into her world. As they begin to cuddle and embrace, one song ends and The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan drops onto the turntable; they begin sweet and tender foreplay as \"Don't Think Twice, It's Alright\" plays.", "Act III: Birdlace and Rose are on the sidewalk in front of her building. She hands him a piece of paper with her address on it. She says he can write, but seems resigned to never hearing from him again. Birdlace runs, with backlighted bridge in background.\nBirdlace finds the other three Bees in the bus station appearing haggard from their night of liberty, and the loud, brash military talk and swagger soon replaces all remnants of his quiet night with Rose. On the military bus to Treasure Island, after exaggerated bragging about spending the night with an officer's wife, Birdlace has a heart-to-heart talk with Burzin about how full of shit they all are. In a great speech that sums up the acceptance of bullshit as the basis of all that they do, Burzin points to the two Bee tattoos on his arm and says there's no bullshit in that. Amid continuing macho talk, Birdlace tears up the paper with Rose's address and throws it out the window - he's \"all in\" with his Marines and their mission.\nDISSOLVE to Rose sitting on the floor in her room, holding her guitar, listening to Pete Seeger's record of We Shall Overcome. She is not at all sad or remorseful; in fact she appears hopeful.\nDISSOLVE to an endless stream of soldiers carrying duffle bags on their shoulders embarking for overseas duty.\nDISSOLVE to TV news report of Kennedy's assassination - not dwelt on long. FADE to black.\nOpen on an exterior shot of the Four Bees playing cards in a military camp in Chu Lai, South Vietnam, 1966. Okie tries to break the monotony by telling a joke. Shells land nearby; Benjamin is killed and Birdlace's leg is wounded. As Okie and Burzin drag Birdlace to safety another shell hits and kills them both. At the sound of another shell exploding, JUMP CUT to a startled Birdlace coming out of the flashback, on the bus going to San Francisco, 1967.\nBirdlace walks the streets of Haight Ashbury to Van Morrison's \"T.B. Sheets.\" As he passes Rose's Coffee Shop a hippie asks Birdlace how many babies did he kill. Birdlace goes into a seedy bar called The Circus - perhaps to remember and relive his first embrace with Rose in the carnival-like room of musical machines. Instead, this is a dive with cheap circus posters and clown paintings. It is also across the street from Rose's and Birdlace watches from the window for a while. The only other patrons are three much older men yet Birdlace seems to fit right in with them - his youth is gone. Tattoos are displayed; Birdlace now has four Bee tattoos in addition to the bluebird of happiness on his hand; the fat bartender has a \"belly dancer\" on his belly. These older guys are crude but they have respect for Birdlace's military service. They describe for Birdlace that Rose Jr is being groomed to take over Rose's Coffee Shop. Birdlace sees Rose come out of the coffee shop with some departing friends, then go back in.\nHe crosses the street to The Rascal's \"Groovin.\"\nThe door is open and has a Peace Corps poster on it. He enters quietly and watches Rose in the same back corner where he first saw her. Now she is drying glasses. He calls her name and she walks to him; few words are spoken.

From acclaimed director Steve James and bestselling author Alex Kotlowitz, this film is an unusually intimate journey into the stubborn, persistence of violence in our cities. Shot over the course of a year out of Kartemquin Films, The Interrupters captures a period in Chicago when it became a national symbol for the violence in our cities. During that period, the city was besieged by high-profile incidents, most notably the brutal beating of Derrion Albert, a Chicago High School student, whose death was caught on videotape. The film's main subjects work for an innovative organization, CeaseFire, which believes that the spread of violence mimics the spread of infectious diseases, and so the treatment should be similar: go after the most infected, and stop the infection at its source. The singular mission of the \"Violence Interrupters\" - who have credibility on the streets because of their own personal histories -- is to intervene in conflicts before they explode into violence. In The Interrupters, Ameena Matthews, whose father is Jeff Fort, one of the city's most notorious gang leaders, was herself a drug ring enforcer. But having children and finding solace in her Muslim faith pulled her off the streets and grounded her. In the wake of Derrion Albert's death, Ameena becomes a close confidante to his mother, and helps her through her grieving. Ameena, who is known among her colleagues for her fearlessness, befriends a feisty teenaged girl who reminds her of herself at that age. The film follows that friendship over the course of many months, as Ameena tries to nudge the troubled girl in the right direction. Cobe Williams, scarred by his father's murder, was in and out of prison, until he had had enough. His family - particularly a young son - helped him find his footing. Cobe disarms others with his humor and his general good nature. His most challenging moment comes when he has to confront a man so bent on revenge that Cobe has to pat him down to make sure he's put away his gun. Like Ameena, he gets deeply involved in the lives of those he encounters, including a teenaged boy just out of prison and a young man from his old neighborhood who's squatting in a foreclosed home. Eddie Bocanegra is haunted by a murder he committed when he was seventeen. His CeaseFire work is a part of his repentance for what he did. Eddie is most deeply disturbed by the aftereffects of the violence on children, and so he spends much of his time working with younger kids in an effort to both keep them off the streets and to get support to those who need it - including a 16-year-old girl whose brother died in her arms. Soulful and empathic, Eddie, who learned to paint in prison, teaches art to children, trying to warn them of the debilitating trauma experienced by those touched by the violence. The Interrupters follows Ameena, Cobe and Eddie as they go about their work, and while doing so reveals their own inspired journeys of hope and redemption. The film attempts to make sense of what CeaseFire's Tio Hardiman calls, simply, \"the madness\"."]},

When a girl that Seth really likes, asks him to get the drink for her party, he sees this as a perfect opportunity to make her his girlfriend. The trio plan out how to get the alcohol, even including Fogell's new fake ID, but things won't got smoothly for the trio. Seth and Evan become separated from Fogell (now called McLovin) and they still haven't got the alcohol for the party that night.", "High school seniors Evan and Seth have been best friends since they were kids, Seth the leader who is all talk and no action, Evan on the most part the faithful follower. They are part of the \"out\" crowd, meaning that they have few other friends and especially few in the \"in\" crowd. They have done everything together by themselves but their plan to be roommates at college falls apart when Seth is not accepted to their school of choice, Dartmouth. Evan decides still to attend Dartmouth and room instead with their mutual friend, the boyishly nerdish Fogell, which Evan decides not to tell Seth about if only in not wanting to make Seth feel like he is being abandoned for another known quantity. Their initial plans to hang out together by themselves for graduation takes a turn when two weeks before graduation, the pretty Jules invites Seth, and by association Evan, to her house party that evening. Knowing that Fogell is getting a fake ID made, Seth, with Jules' money, offers to purchase all the alcohol for the party. Seth believes that the alcohol is his and Evan's ticket to losing their respective virginities that evening at the party, Seth with Jules, and Evan with Becca, who he knows likes him, but whose advances he has been unable to act upon out of shyness and insecurity. But the road to purchasing the alcohol and being the kings of Jules' party takes a less than smooth path, based largely on Fogell's cluelessness about his new ID, the actions of a couple of adolescently-minded police officers, and Seth and Evan's own attitudes of what they need to do to be popular, if only for this one day. Through the process, Seth and Evan may come to a clearer picture of what their friendship truly means, and where they fit in life.", "Hilarious comedy about two high school seniors who have been best friends since they were young and are preparing to finally graduate. They aren't exactly \"popular\", however, that won't stop them from doing whatever they can to finally lose their virginity before college to the prettiest and coolest girls in school. When one of the girls asks them to get alcohol for the party they set out on an adventure to get it and bring it to the graduation house party. Unfortunately, the trip turns out to be a lot more difficult then they had originally planned. Will they make it to the party with the alcohol in time? Or will they miss the final chance to lose their virginities to the girls of their dreams and lose each other in the process?", "Seth (Jonah Hill) and Evan (Michael Cera) are about to graduate from high school. Best friends for years, they face an uncertain future: Evan has been accepted into Dartmouth but Seth will have to attend the local state university. Both boys are notably horny but still virginal, something they want to correct before leaving for college at the end of the summer. Neither is particularly popular, as evidenced when a particularly obnoxious classmates stops them before school one day to not invite them to his graduation party. Seth and Evan do have female classmates to whom they are attracted. Seth is pretty sure that Jules (Emma Stone) returns his interest, but Evan is oblivious to the fact that Becca (Martha MacIsaac) wants to get with him. Seth resents Becca both for the trouble she caused for him in first grade when she revealed his obsession with drawing penises, and because she threatens his close relationship with Evan. In home economics class, Jules invites Seth and Evan to her graduation party that night. When painfully nerdy friend Fogell (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) reveals that he is about to get a fake ID, Seth is determined to provide the alcohol for Jules's party. Because Becca will attend Jules's party, too, Seth is convinced that he and Evan will have sex that night.", "Things immediately go wrong. Seth's car is towed when he parks in the faculty parking lot. When Fogell arrives with his fake ID, Seth is appalled to learn that Fogell has adopted the name \"McLovin.\" Believing that the ID won't be accepted, Seth plans to shoplift vast quantities of liquor from a supermarket but chickens out at the last minute. Instead, he and Evan send Fogell to a liquor store. Much to his surprise, Fogell successfully uses his fake ID to buy the liquor. But before he can leave the store, he is knocked unconscious by a robber. Because they went to ogle a buxom woman down the street, Evan and Seth don't see the robbery. They do see the police car arrive and assume that Fogell is being arrested for using a fake ID. Distraught at having neither the alcohol nor the $100 Jules gave him to buy alcohol, Seth panics. He is then hit by a car driven by Francis (Joe Lo Truglio). Francis is desperate for Seth not to report the incident to the police and agrees to procure alcohol for them. Even though Francis is creepy, Seth and Evan accompany him to a house party miles from the liquor store. Shortly after getting there, Francis is beaten up by the home owner, Mark (Kevin Corrigan). Evan is angry that Seth has dragged him to this dangerous party and announces he will no longer allow Seth to dictate the course of their friendship. Seth accuses Evan of deserting him as a friend. Seth returns to the party to steal alcohol. He dirty dances with Mark's menstruating girlfriend and winds up with a blood stain on his pants. When Mark sees this, he picks a fight with Seth. Evan tries to call Becca but can't get good reception on his cell phone so goes back into the house to use a landline. He finds himself trapped in a room with cocaine snorting thugs who mistakenly think he is the golden-throated brother of someone else. He sings \"These Eyes\" to placate them. Eventually, Evan and Seth manage to escape the party with large amounts of alcohol concealed in two large laundry detergent jugs.", "Meanwhile, Fogell was not arrested by the police. In fact, Officers Slater and Michaels (Bill Hader and Seth Rogen) seem to be impressed with his taste in alcohol and ability to take a punch. Fogell winds up spending the night with them. He helps them subdue a violent drunk at a local bar and then shares a beer with them. They reveal a rather casual attitude towards police procedure and even let Fogell hold their guns. Slater and Michaels receive a call to break up a fight at the party Seth and Evan are trapped at. On the way to the party, Slater runs into Seth, knocking him to the ground. When he discovers alcohol in one of the detergent jugs, he plans to arrest Seth and Evan. But while Slater and Michaels try to devise a plan to explain the damage to the squad car, Fogell, Evan and Seth escape along with the detergent jugs and all of the alcohol Fogell bought, which he had been carrying with him while patrolling with Slater and Michaels. They take the bus to Jules's party. On the way, Seth learns that Evan and Fogell have already decided to room together at Dartmouth.", "Becca is already there and already drunk. Evan learns she has spent the evening drinking heavily and announcing her intentions to have sex with him. She drags him to Jules's bedroom and drunkenly tries to seduce him. He resists, wanting their relationship to be more than physical. She throws up. Seth has no greater luck. Convinced that Jules will sleep with him only if they are drunk, he gets inebriated but is surprised to learn both that Jules doesn't drink and that she would prefer they hook up when both are sober. Confused, Seth passes out; on the way down, his head slams into Jules's, giving her a black eye. When he comes to, he sees Slater and Michaels have arrived to bust the party. He rushes inside and, finding Evan drunk and passed out, carries him to safety. Michaels and Slater find Fogell in a bedroom about to have sex with Nicola (Aviva). Slater is angry that Fogell abandoned them but Michaels calms him down. They tell Fogell that they knew his ID was fake but remembered how much they hated police officers when they were Fogell's age. Wanting to demonstrate to him that cops could be cool, too, they took him out on patrol. They all agree to be friends. To impress the ladies, Fogell has Slater and Michaels drag him away as though he were a dangerous criminal. Then they go to a deserted parking lot, do donuts in the squad car, then trash it.", "Evan and Seth go back to Evan's house. They make miniature pizzas and climb into their sleeping bags. They confess that they will always love one another as friends. The next day, they go to the shopping mall; Evan wants a new comforter to take to Dartmouth and Seth needs new pants. There they see Becca and Jules. Becca thanks Evan for not taking advantage of her drunkenness and Seth apologizes to Jules for his own embarrassing behavior. Becca and Evan decide to go shopping for comforters and Seth will help Jules buy makeup to cover up her black eye.

With tableaux beautifully vivid and forceful, it recounts the touching relationships which develop when Gorky is put into custody at his grandparents' home. His grandmother, a simple woman who knows how to make people laugh, represents optimism in the direst situations, honesty in a world of deceit. Gorky's poverty-stricken childhood formed his life-long compassion for the underdog, and the film is filled with powerful portraits of lower class people whose qualities of integrity and dignity shine through their hopeless circumstances. Among many others are the half-blind Grigory, who works at the grandfather's dye factory, and Gorky's little orphaned friends, who live out of garbage cans, dreaming of a utopian neverland. From these portraits come an inspiring, panoramic view of human conditions and conflicts."]},

The film is a mixture of magic, black humor and romantic love. The story is set in a pagan Estonian village where werewolves, the plague, and spirits roam. The villagers' main problem is how to survive the cold, dark winter. And, to that aim, nothing is taboo. People steal from each other, from their German manor lords, and from spirits, the devil, and Christ. To guard their souls, they'll give them away to thieving creatures made of wood and metal called kratts, who help their masters by stealing more. They steal even if their barns are already overflowing. Stealing is an obsession that makes the villagers more and more like the soulless creatures they command, the kratts. The main character of the film is a young farm girl named Liina who is hopelessly and forlornly in love with a village boy named Hans. Her longing makes the girl become a werewolf and jump into an ice-cold pond. She's ready to die in the name of love. The pragmatic farmers are faced with a question: is the life that they've won through so much toil worth anything, if it lacks a soul? Estonian pagan and European Christian mythologies come together in this film. Both mythologies look for a miracle; for an ancient force that gives one a soul. This film is about souls - longing for a soul, selling your soul, and living without a soul."]},

Much of the story deals with his struggle to whip his group into a disciplined fighting unit in spite of heavy losses, and withering attacks by German fighters over their targets. Actual combat footage is used in this tense war drama.", "An American bomber group low on morale and performance after heavy losses over the skies of Nazi Germany. General Frank Savage (Gregory Peck), a desk-bound staff chief, is sent to the group after the group commander is relieved of duty. At first encountering resistance, Savage eventually shows the pilots how to take pride in their unit and serve above and beyond the standards of the U.S. Army Air Corps.", "In 1949, American attorney and former U.S. Army Air Forces officer Harvey Stovall (Dean Jagger) is vacationing in Great Britain when he spots a familiar Toby Jug in an antique shop window. He asks the proprietor where he bought the jug and he is told that it came from Archbury, which is the location of the former Royal Air Force Station Archbury and USAAF station where Stovall served with the 918th Bomb Group during World War II. Convinced that it is the same jug, he buys it and journeys by train and bicycle to the ex-RAF airfield at Archbury, now abandoned and used as pasture, but with the runways, taxiways, control tower and other buildings still standing. As Stovall relives memories of the place, the scene flashes back to 1942 and the main plot begins.", "Having recently arrived and been thrown into action, the 918th has gained the reputation of a \"bad luck group\" suffering from poor morale. One reason is the U.S. strategy of daylight precision bombing and the corresponding losses to German anti-aircraft fire and Luftwaffe fighter aircraft. In addition, their commander, Colonel Keith Davenport (Gary Merrill), has become too close to his men to instil adequate discipline. When he is ordered to fly a mission at low altitude to increase accuracy, Davenport rushes to headquarters and confronts his friend, Brigadier General Frank Savage (Gregory Peck), the Assistant Chief of Staff for Operations. His behavior prompts Savage to go to Major General Patrick Pritchard (Millard Mitchell), commanding general of VIII Bomber Command, and tell him that that he feels Davenport might crack under the strain. Pritchard eventually relieves Davenport of command and the 918th is given to Savage.", "In order to address discipline problems, Savage deals with everyone so harshly that the men begin to detest him. Upset by the contrast of Savage's stern leadership, all of the 918th's pilots apply for transfers. Savage asks the Group Adjutant, Major Stovall, to delay processing their applications to buy him some time since, as an attorney in civilian life, Stovall knows how to use \"red tape. When the 918th resumes combat flying with greater success after hasty refresher training, the men begin to change their minds, especially after Savage leads them on a mission in which the 918th is the only group to bomb the target and have all of the aircraft return safely.", "The word gets around that Pritchard personally chewed Savage out for his claim of \"radio malfunction\" as an excuse to ignore the recall order. But rather than incurring any form of punishment for this disobedience, Savage persuades Pritchard to recommend the group for a Distinguished Unit Citation. When the Inspector General arrives to check out the unrest, Savage is packing ready to go, but the pilots withdraw their requests to transfer. Savage also softens his attitude towards the men as he becomes more closely involved with them and is warned about the consequences by Keith Davenport on one of his visits.", "As the air war advances deeper into Germany, missions become longer and riskier, with enemy resistance intensifying. Many of Savage's best men (including Bishop and Cobb) are shot down or killed. Pritchard tries to get Savage to return to a staff job at VIII Bomber Command, but Savage refuses because he feels that the 918th is incapable of performing without him. Reluctantly, Pritchard leaves him in command. However, before a particularly dangerous raid, Savage becomes disoriented and erratic; unable to haul himself up into his B-17, he has to be relieved. While waiting for the groups return, Savage becomes catatonic. Only as they fly back relatively unharmed after destroying the target, does he regain his composure and fall asleep.", "The story then returns to 1949 and Stovall, who leaves the Toby mug on the fireplace mantle of the abandoned airfield's officers' club and pedals away on his bicycle."]},

She begins to discover herself as human with tragic and terrifying consequences.", "In Glasgow, a motorcyclist (Jeremy McWilliams) retrieves an inert young woman (Lynsey Taylor Mackay) from the roadside and places her in the back of a van, where a naked woman (Scarlett Johansson) dons her clothes. After buying clothes and make-up at a shopping centre, the woman drives the van around Scotland, picking up men. She lures a man (Joe Szula) into a dilapidated house.

The victims are then stripped and consumed. However, human existence in all its complexity begin to change the alien visitor.", "In the opening shot, there is a tiny ball of light, which turns into a bright circular flash, slowly coming into view with a circular object. Amidst the ominous tone that plays, we hear a woman's voice making sounds, trying to get her speech down to being perfect (down to a Scottish accent). We see what appears to be a black liquid circular pool. The light and the circular object come together to form an eye - a mysterious woman's eye.", "A shot of a long curving road among the mountains of Scotland with a single headlight appears. The view changes and we see it is an unknown man on a motorcycle.", "The man rides his motorcycle to a tunnel where he stops. He gets off the bike and walks off the road into a ditch, appearing a moment later carrying a young woman's body. We assume he knew the body was there because he goes directly to it, so he either knows how she died or was involved in killing her. He throws the body into the back of a white van.", "Next, we see the woman's dead body being unceremoniously undressed by another naked young woman (Scarlett Johansson) in a completely white, brightly lit room. This scene contrasts with the scenes of dark/black rooms we will see later in the movie. After the woman is dressed, she stands over the body and stares at it. The camera focuses on the now nude woman's body and we see a tear fall from her eye. (We are not sure at this point if she was indeed dead, and the tear was simply a reflex, or if she is perhaps in some catatonic state.) The name and identity of this woman remains unknown throughout the film, but due to the tear falling, and due to the motorcycle man knowing exactly where the body was, she may have been in some sort of comatose state and aware of what was going on. The woman who took the clothing bends down over the body and seems to inspect something she picked up from the body. It appears to be an ant that was crawling on the dead/comatose woman's body.", "The next scene opens with a cloudy sky and mysterious lights above a tall skyscraper. This scene is supposed to indicate that it is an alien presence that the film is depicting, although this particular scene is so brief the significance of it is lost unless the viewer pays close attention.", "The mysterious female (at this point we are unclear if she is an alien, a succubus, or some sort of machine, but since the movie is based on a book that was written about an alien, the prevailing theory is that she is an alien) is then seen leaving a dirty rundown looking house. The white van is parked outside, and the motorcycle man is there as well. The relationship between the two is unclear at this point, although they seem connected (In the book, the male is the female alien's superior officer, and in the film we see hints of this relationship, although sparse and unexplained). These two, although seen together in a few scenes, and often in the same areas, do not communicate at all in the film, leaving us to assume they communicate telepathically or some other way. The man departs on his motorcycle, and the woman gets into the white van and begins to drive.", "The following scene opens with the mysterious young woman/alien in a crowded shopping mall. She seems to pick out several items of clothing including a faux fur coat and red lipstick. She then continues to drive in the white van around Glasgow, eyeing men as she drives past. She passes through several crowds of people before stopping on a less crowded street to approach a man who is alone, like any good predator would. She asks him for directions to the local M8 motorway and they converse. Several separate scenes repeat the same pattern- she seeks out lone men walking and asks for directions or some other banal topic. She asks basic questions of these men, such as their names, where they are from, and also more in depth questions that lead you to think her intentions might be more sinister. She asks questions such as if they are alone, if they have a family, if they are going anywhere, and also more personal questions, studying her prey, such as, \"Why do you like to be alone?\" She drives off when a subject appears to not fit her criteria - at one point, a siren from a police car sounds nearby, and she drives away. At another point, one of the men she is speaking to is called to from somewhere in the distance. She loses interest and drives off. When she is able to determine a candidate is adequate, she invites him into her van for a ride and begins another line of questions - \"Do you have a girlfriend? Do you think I'm pretty?\" Finally, she finds a man with a green and white scarf who fits her criteria, and we see them entering the run-down house. The surroundings fade to black, and as she looks at the man seductively over her shoulder, undressing, he follows, also undressing. Once the man is completely naked, as he approaches her, instead of getting closer, he suddenly sinks into the floor, as if it were made of liquid. The man appears not to notice, seeming to be hypnotized by the woman. Once he has fully disappeared, the mysterious alien/woman picks up her clothing and walks off camera.", "Some time passes, and we can assume the alien woman continues her preying on men, due to scenes of her in the van again driving around.", "The alien woman is at the beach, and we see her watching a solo male swimming in a wet suit. When he comes ashore she begins her line of questions, what is he doing here, why is he in Scotland. The two are interrupted by the screams of a woman being pushed out to sea by huge waves after she tries swimming out to save her drowning dog, and a man in a heavy coat seems to be swimming after her. The man in the wet suit rushes over to help, while the alien woman stands there watching, completely passive, as these events progress. The woman in the water is eventually lost to sight, but the man in the wet suit manages to pull the man in the heavy coat, presumably the woman's husband, to shore, only to have the man rush back into the waters chasing after his wife, who has already been swept too far out. The man in the wet suit, exhausted from his efforts, does not chase him, instead collapsing on the shore. We seem him move so we know he is alive. Finally, the alien woman springs into action, at first we think to help, but what she does instead is find a rock and bash the man in the wet suit in the head, to ensure he is either unconscious or dead.", "The scene cuts to another part of the beach where she is dragging the body of the man in the wet suit past a crying child. Since the man in the wet suit was alone, we can assume the baby belonged to the man and the woman who were swept to sea. The alien woman is completely unfazed by the crying child, intent on her task of dragging the body. She eventually gets the body in the car, and we see the man on the motorcycle locate a tent on the beach which we can assume belonged to the man in the wet suit. He appears to fold up the tent, and take it with him. We are reminded of the opening scene in which he had originally found a woman either dead or comatose, so we can assume either he or another alien made a victim of that woman, and he was sent to clean it up like he is doing now. We hear the child still crying, and it is now night - the motorcycle man walks toward the child as if to console him, or to pick him up, but stops a few feet away and bends to pick up an article of clothing that was left behind - as if the wet suit man's body and taking all of his personal belongings are of significance, but the crying child is not. We also see the woman, back in the van, and hear crying again - she seems to notice the crying this time, but looks out her window to see she is back in the city, and the crying is from the vehicle next to her, where a child is in the back seat of a vehicle parked nearby. It is not the same child from the beach, but perhaps she was thinking about that child.", "The woman is next seen that evening in her white van in a parking lot. In the car on the other side of her is a group of rowdy men who seem to catcall her. She follows them around what seems like an abandoned building, and when she sees the man who called to her alone outside, she exits the van and starts to approach. As she nears the other side of the building, she suddenly sees a large crowd and realizes the man has gone into a club. A crowd of outgoing women intercept her as she turns to leave and insist she go into the club with them. The alien looks absolutely baffled by these woman and gets ushered into the club with the throng of women urging her to do so. As soon as she enters the club there is loud music, flashing lights, and people everywhere. The first door that she sees, the alien woman escapes into, but it is not a door that leads outside, instead it leads to some sort odd lounge area, where she is again approached by the man who called to her from the road. He insists that she let him buy her a drink, and we see them dancing in the club.", "The scene then cuts to the all-black room in the run-down house where the first man sank into the floor. The club guy is dancing, half-naked. We see the alien woman undressing and staring at the club guy seductively. As she walks backward, the club guy sinks into the floor, exactly like the first man, staring at her so intently he seems not to notice that he is sinking. After he is gone, the alien woman walks off, and the camera suddenly pans to the view from under the liquid floor- the man stares up at her as she walks away, unaware of his surroundings until she is out of sight. It isn't until she leaves that he seems to suddenly be aware of what is around him - nothing but blackness, he appears to be frozen somehow, not able to move and the sound seems deadened around him, but he is otherwise alive. Suddenly he looks up, and he sees the first man who was swallowed into the floor with him, floating before him, also in an apparent state of frozen preservation. The first man we saw sink into the floor seems older somehow, his skin twisting oddly on his frame, and he seems to be screaming or mouthing to the club guy, but there is no sound coming from his mouth. The two drift closer to each other - close enough to barely touch hands for a moment, and then the first guy starts drifting backwards with a pleading look of helplessness on his face. Suddenly a sharp snap noise punctuates the silence, and the first victim POPS like a balloon- his skin stretching out and then shrivel-ling up, just like a popped balloon would. The empty skin floats aimlessly in the black void, twisting like a plastic bag in the wind. The man from the club stares in shock as the empty skin of the first victim gruesomely floats away. We see what looks like a rivulet of blood and debris being funneled down a conveyor belt of some type, followed by disturbing musical tones, and then a bright piercing of reddish light engulfs the screen. We can interpret this as the woman somehow either devouring these men inside of her body (the black goo) where they are destroyed and their skins kept, or another interpretation centering from the novel is that they are in a state of stasis so they can be sent to the alien world to be devoured by the aliens, and the man's body popping was him being eaten and the blood on the conveyor belt going down the hatch showing that he was killed and his body used by them, and the bright light following this scene is supposed to be another sign of alien presence although again, it is so subtle to the point of being almost insignificant.", "We see the alien woman in the van the next day. There is a broadcast on the radio about a body that was found washed up on the beach, obviously drowned. The broadcast references that the man was supposedly at the beach with his wife and 18-month-old child. Obviously, this was the man and woman from the beach with their child. The alien woman seems to pay attention to the broadcast, but shows little emotion. Throughout the day, rather than staring at men, she pays more attention to women and children. But, eventually she does find a man, who tells her she is gorgeous, and that there is something about her eyes (hypnotic, perhaps). She barely seems as interested in him as she was previously with the males she abducted. They end up at the run-down house, and the two are seen entering, but the scene fades to black.", "The woman is then seen applying her lipstick in a different room - this room is dark and with a cobbled stone floor, not the same dark room where she seduces and traps the men (resembling the interior of a stable or garage leading to an outside street). The motorcycle guy is there, and he paces around her angrily. It is obvious the two are communicating, albeit without words (maybe through telepathy). Something she has done has caused the motorcycle man to be displeased, causing him to somehow question or lecture her actions. (If the motorcycle man and the mysterious woman are communicating through telepathy, we do not hear and are not privy to the conversation... so one can only speculate). He stares into her eyes intently for a moment, and then abruptly turns away from her and leaves the room.", "The woman is walking down the street and is accidentally tripped and falls flat, face first onto the pavement where she lies still. It is almost as if she is shocked by this event. She lays there unmoving, and eventually a passersby pull her up, asking if she is okay and insisting on helping. She seems perturbed by these events and continues walking. She takes notice of the people around her who pass - not just the men, but women, children, elderly. It is as if she is noticing them for the first time - people smiling, laughing, going about their daily tasks. Almost as if she can see herself in them.", "Back in the van later that night, she watches as a single man crosses an empty street, but makes no move to approach him. A moment later, a younger man bangs on her window. He talks to her but he is muffled. He bangs harder and demands she roll down her window. Suddenly, more hoodlums show up and also bang on the windows, demanding she get out of the van. Could they possibly recognize her as the woman who picked up their friend from the club, or one of the other men she abducted? After all, she has been driving around for quite a while, approaching all the men she could find. She drives off and appears unfazed by the hoodlums.", "Later that night she finds a single man and uses her same \"I am lost\" conversation starter to approach him. (Adam Pearson). His face is disfigured due to a condition called neurofibromatosis. She picks him up and gives him a lift. She begins to ask him the typical questions, but does not seem to understand that the man is disfigured and odd-looking, and therefore outcast by society. The alien asks the man when he last touched someone, and if anyone has touched him. He is nervous and uncertain as she takes his hand and lets him caress her face. Perhaps she is thinking she can give this man something nobody else has- because of his disfigurement, he has not been with a woman, and because she is an alien, she does not have the same emotional disgust, fear or shock that other women project toward this man. She takes him into the run-down house and for the first time we see how truly dilapidated the structure is. In the all-black room we see a dark, shiny silhouette approach. The alien woman completely undresses, which is different as she usually stays partially clothed. She lures the disfigured man into the black liquid, but after he is submerged, we see a slender black skeleton on the screen before the scene cuts away to the woman walking down the stairs afterward, like she has done before after seducing her prey, only this time she pauses and gazes into a dirty mirror, staring into her own eyes, perhaps reflecting on what she has done. She stares for a long moment. Her gaze is pulled away by a fly tapping against the door, perhaps trapped like the man she just seduced.", "In the next scene, we see her leave the run-down house, with the deformed man alive, still naked, and seemingly still hypnotized, or not aware of what has transpired. She seems to let him free as he is seen walking naked through a field toward a town. It is dawn. The motorcyclist speeds into a housing estate, stopping by a bungalow. He strides up to a car in the driveway, smashes the driver's window and then reaches in to flick a button to open the boot. He then purposefully marches to the back garden where he meets the deformed man climbing through the fence. We do not see him kill or harm the deformed man, but we see from a distance him placing a body into the boot, all the time being watched by a neighbor from her window. As he drives off he looks at the woman, unconcerned.", "At this point, the film takes a different turn and focuses more on the alien woman's attempts to understand humanity, rather than hunting them as prey.", "Later that day, the alien woman is driving to a secluded beach. She has shed her faux fur coat. She stands in the fog at a lonely beach, perhaps taking it in, perhaps knowing she has done something wrong and unsure of what her next move should be. She hears singing in the background, and a bird chirping. We see her walking down a long abandoned dirt road in what looks like the middle of nowhere.", "The motorcycle man, meanwhile, stands by the mirror of the abandoned house, as if looking for some clue of what the alien woman might have been thinking.", "The alien woman has found a restaurant in the mountains. She watches the patrons eating, and is served a piece of delicious-looking chocolate cake. We see her carefully slice off a piece and take a bite, only to immediately spit it out. Any thought that she might still be human is gone at this point, as we realize that she cannot even do something like eat human food. She walks through the secluded mountain town as if she is going to leave, but a villager tells her the bus will be stopping soon, so she decides to wait at the bus stop. She seems uncomfortable, and that continues even after she gets on the bus. The bus driver questions her casually, as to why she is not wearing a coat, is she \"feeling alright?\" A man on the bus also questions her, concerned but also obviously interested in her. She gets off the bus with the passenger and together they go to the grocery store. She looks around at the items with confusion, as if she has never been in a store before. She is now wearing the man's jacket, and they go to his house. She takes notice of the people in the buildings around them as they walk. She watches TV with the man from the bus while he eats, her food remaining untouched. They listen to the radio, and she idly taps her fingers while music plays. The man brings her a cup of tea and bids her goodnight. She explores the room she is staying in, and inspects her naked body, carefully looking at her legs, toes and fingers.", "We see several men on motorcycles zooming down a road. They seem to go in different directions. They might be spreading out in search of the renegade alien woman.", "The next morning she goes for a walk with the man from the bus, and he lifts and carries her over a deep puddle. The motorcyclist stops over a busy overpass and looks in both directions, perhaps trying to sense where the alien woman has gone.", "Meanwhile, the nice treatment by the man from the bus causes her to exhibit more emotions. They are together in her room at his house and she turns to him as if to kiss him. He obliges, and they begin to undress. She seems unsure of what to do, which is funny considering how she had previously seduced so many men. She lets him take control, but before they can have intercourse, he seems to struggle while entering her. Sudden realization dawns on her, she grabs a light and gazes between her legs. It appears she has a human form that is not complete. She leaves the man's house, and we see her walking alone across a barren field surrounded by a vast forest. She is running, still wrapped in the coat she got from the man on the bus, and she is wet from rain. She may be running from shame or embarrassment after the incident with the guy from the bus, or she could be trying to evade the motorcycle men searching for her.", "She runs into a forest worker who begins talking to her about the forest, not getting any replies, and asking, \"Are you on your own?\" before wishing her well and leaving. Eventually, she comes across a stone-built hut for hikers in the woods. It continues to rain outside. She eyes a fireplace covered in black soot. Perhaps it reminds her of the dilapidated house with the black chamber where she would entrap men, or perhaps it simply reminds her that she is cold - something she rarely seemed to notice previously in the movie. She zips up her coat, huddles into a corner of the building and curls into a ball, falling asleep. Time passes and she awakens to find the forest worker in the cabin with her groping her. She snaps awake and runs from the cabin. She looks back but sees no one. She hides for a while until she realizes nobody is following and then she finds a logging truck, climbing into the driver's seat. She sees the forest worker approaching and honks the horn to alert anybody but, as nobody comes, she runs back into the forest with him in pursuit. He catches her and starts to violently rip off her clothes. She seems confused and scared, and in the struggle he not only rips her clothes but also her skin, to find she has another black skin underneath. He staggers away in shock and she gets up, slowly walks away and starts to peel off her human flesh from her head and upper body, kneels down and looks at her still-blinking human face, held in her lap. The forest worker sneaks up behind her, douses her in gasoline, and deploys a match. The alien, carrying her broken human flesh with her, stumbles away, but it is too late, the flames progress up her legs and we see her running across the hillside on fire. Not too far away, she collapses.", "We see the motorcycle man standing on a hilltop far above. It is unclear whether he sees the body burning, or if he suddenly lost any trace of the female alien and either knows she has come to harm or does not know what happened.", "In the final scene, we see the alien woman's form as nothing more than a pile of ash, the flames beginning to die down. The camera follows the smoke upwards as it drifts into the sky.", "The final shot is a prolonged view of snow falling from the sky."]},

Largely self-inflicted due to remorse and grief, Jack goes on a quick downward spiral, both personally and professionally, after a glib comment he makes to one of his regular callers results in that caller going on a murder spree. Three years later, the only emotional and financial support a despondent Jack receives is from his current video store owning girlfriend, Anne. When Jack hits rock bottom, he meets a seemingly crazy and homeless man calling himself Parry. Parry does have mental health issues, namely hallucinations centered around the story of the Fisher King, which is why he has an obsession with obtaining the Holy Grail. When Jack learns of Parry's own background and the reason he got to where he is, Jack feels he needs to be part of Parry's salvation. He figures the way to do so is to connect Parry with Lydia Sinclair, a shy and uncoordinated woman who Parry loves from afar. In doing so, Jack may himself be able to recapture his old life back. But if he does, he may not realize that he was no saint in that former life.", "A former radio shock-jock (Bridges) sinks into a boozy depression when his flip comment on the air is blamed for a shooting spree in an upscale cafe. Living off the kindness of long-suffering girlfriend Anne (Ruehl, who won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress), Jack has an epiphany when he is rescued from street punks by Parry (Williams), a homeless former professor who has created a world of his own invention to insulate himself from the pain of witnessing his wife's death in the cafe shooting spree.", "The story opens in a radio broadcast studio where arrogant and cynical \"shock jock\" Jack Lucas (Jeff Bridges) talks to a caller named Edwin Malnick (Christian Clemenson) about the banality of the social scene in New York City, where his show is broadcast. Edwin tells Jack about a bad date he'd had recently, sounding quite despondent over being rejected by a woman. Jack tells Edwin, in a largely dismissive tone, that social status dictates that Edwin will never be successful if he tries to enter this woman's more aristocratic social circle. Jack's show ends for the day and he returns to his lush penthouse where quarrels briefly with his girlfriend (whom leaves) and admires himself, repeating his tagline (\"FORGIVE me!!). Jack turns on the news and finds out that Edwin, in a fit of despondency, had killed several people in a popular Manhattan restaurant with a shotgun before killing himself with the same weapon. Jack is devastated, blaming himself for Edwin's breakdown.", "Three years later Jack is off the radio and morbidly depressed, living with a woman, Anne Napolitano (Mercedes Ruehl), who owns a video store downstairs from her apartment. Jack drinks heavily and works part-time for Anne. When Jack offends a chatty customer, Anne tells him to go back to her apartment and get some rest. That night, Jack, while watching a television show he's produced based on his radio experiences, insults Anne, saying that he's only lived with her for sex. Anne storms off and Jack leaves the apartment, taking a bottle with him. Mistaken for a bum on the street, a small child gives him a wooden Pinocchio doll. Jack ends up near the Manhattan Bridge at the East River, feeling suicidal with cinder blocks tied to his ankles. While he prepares himself to jump in the water, he's attacked by two young men who believe he's a vagrant; they beat him severely, douse him with gasoline and intend to burn him alive. Just as they light a match, they are attacked by another bum who speaks much like a medieval knight and wields a non-lethal bow and arrow. Several other bums join him and sing \"How About You?\" and Jack's would-be killers are quickly outnumbered and defeated. One of the killers is captured and tied up by the vagrants' leader and left to be victimized by anyone who comes along. Jack is initially terrified of the leader, who is suddenly kind and takes him to a safe area under a bridge, populated by more homeless men. Jack spends an hallucinatory night with them, even impressing them all when his coat briefly catches fire, causing him to dance around in a panic.", "The man takes Jack back to his home, the maintenance room in the basement of an apartment building. The man tells Jack his name is Parry (Robin Williams) and that he's a knight on a sacred quest; Perry believes the Holy Grail is in the home of a prominent architect living in a castle-like building on the Upper East Side. Parry also hints that he is often visited by the \"little people\", hallucinations that advise him on the quest. Parry, however, is terrified of the Red Knight, a large, monstrous enemy that rides a black horse and breathes fire. Jack also notices that Parry has a small shrine dedicated to a young woman to whom he's infatuated, however, Parry yanks him away from the shrine when he discovers him there. Parry believes that Jack has been sent to aide him in his quest. Jack tells Parry openly that he's crazy and leaves. As he walks out, he meets the building manager who at first thinks Parry has invited someone to live with him. The manager tells Jack that Parry used to live in an apartment in the building a few years ago before his wife was murdered. The manager goes on to say that Parry's wife was killed in the same tragic restaurant shooting incident that Jack believed he caused.", "Jack goes back to Anne's apartment, finding her distraught at his disappearance but happy to see him alive. He explains what happened the previous night and how he was attacked. Jack realizes that much or all of his depressive state can be relieved if he helps Parry. He asks Anne about the Holy Grail and she pontificates on the nature of good and evil and God and the Devil. The two of them have sex. Later, Jack tells Anne that he feels he's cursed because of the trouble he believes he caused Parry and she tries to comfort him.", "Jack revisits Parry's home and is met by the manager who tells Jack more about Parry: his real name is Henry Sagan and he was a professor of medieval studies at Hunter College. After his wife was killed in Edwin's shooting spree, he fell into a catatonic state and lived in an asylum on Staten Island. One day he simply awoke from his catatonia and became Parry. He was taken back to his old apartment building where the manager allowed him to live in the basement. The manager also tells Jack that Henry was deeply in love with his wife.", "Jack finds Parry in the Midtown area of Manhattan, sitting atop a parked car, oblivious to the alarm blaring. Jack offers Parry money for compensation, however, Parry gives it to another homeless man. Jack is angry, but Parry grabs him, pulling him behind a column. A woman, Lydia (Amanda Plummer), has emerged from the skyscraper, the same woman that Parry had built the shrine to in his home. She is at once clumsy and awkward, finding it difficult to negotiate her way past people and through the building's revolving door. Parry and Jack follow her to a Chinese restaurant where they watch her through the window. Later, she stops at a news stand, where she buys a new novel, a habit that Parry has noticed; she buys a new book every few days. After she returns to work, Parry tells Jack that he's \"deeply smitten\" with her but lacks the self-confidence to approach her. Just then Parry's nemesis, the Red Knight, appears. Jack cannot see the monster; it is a hallucinatory manifestation of Parry's own fear that only he can see. However, Parry yells that the Red Knight is uncharacteristically afraid of Jack and drags Jack along on the chase. They race through Central Park until Jack, lagging behind, finds Parry sitting on a rock. Parry tells Jack that their combined effort has frightened the Red Knight off. The pair hear screaming and happen across another homeless man (Michael Jeter) who had buried himself in the dirt of a horse trail in the park, hoping that riders will trample him. Jack and Parry take him to a homeless shelter where Jack comforts the man while Parry tries to stir the other patients into song. Jack talks briefly with the man they rescued who tells him he's a cabaret singer and a veteran who watched all his friends die.", "Later, back in Central Park on the Great Lawn, Jack lays on the grass with Parry next to him. Parry is nude, unafraid of the danger in the park at night, and gazes at the clouds and stars and tells Jack the story of the Fisher King, who once possessed the Holy Grail but lost it, grew old and became depressed. The king was saved by a passing fool who gives him a drink of water; the cup he uses is the Grail itself and the king is revived. Parry says he has a vague memory of a lecture he gave on the story as a professor before his mental breakdown. Jack suggests that Parry needs to be introduced to Lydia and says he'll help him.", "Jack returns to Anne's place and formulates a plan to have Parry meet Lydia socially. He poses as a contest official and tells Lydia she's won a free membership at Anne's store. Lydia is not so easily fooled and hangs up on Jack. Jack sends the cabaret singer to Lydia's office; the man does a flamboyant musical number informing Lydia she won the membership.", "Lydia shows up at the video store. Parry is there too, posing as an employee. Lydia's membership is squared away and Parry helps her find a few movies to rent. She doesn't find any she'd like but notices that Anne has a fancy manicure. Anne tells her that she does her nails herself and she'll do Lydia's for a reasonable fee. Lydia agrees and Anne invites her to her apartment that night. Jack will meet them there later with Parry and they'll all go to dinner. Jack gives Parry his wallet to pay for dinner.", "Anne and Lydia talk about Lydia's need for self-confidence. Jack helps Parry clean up for dinner. The four go to a Chinese restaurant where the plan to get Lydia and Parry together is successful. Jack and Anne go back to Anne's place and Parry escorts Lydia home. Lydia expresses many assumptions about Parry, believing that he'll stay with her one night and leave. Parry tells her that he's quite in love with her and promises to contact her again. As he leaves, Parry's abnormal fear hits him, he sees the Red Knight and runs screaming into the night. He ends up at the same spot where he found Jack when Jack attempted suicide. A few moments later, while Parry lies on the ground, twitching uncontrollably, the same two punks who tried to kill Jack find him - both are standing on either side of the Red Knight. The punks beat him severely.", "The next day Jack calls his old radio agent and tells him he'd like to get back on the air. Anne comes on to Jack, however, Jack asks to talk to her seriously; Jack thinks that he needs to break up with her because his career may once again take off. Anne is instantly furious and upset and argues with him. Just then, Jack receives a phone call from the police; they found Jack's wallet on Parry when he was brought to a hospital. At the hospital, Anne and Jack find out about the assault and that Parry has become catatonic again. Parry will be remanded to a mental hospital until he regains his mind.", "Jack settles quite easily back into his previous life as a radio host, however, his arrogance and insensitivity have mellowed greatly. He is also in talks to produce a television talk show. While in a meeting with a TV executive, Jack leaves unexpectedly and visits Parry, bringing him the Pinocchio doll he'd gotten from the child. Jack tells Parry that he knows Parry wants him to steal the \"grail\" from the castle on the Upper East Side, however, he also refuses to do it. Jack demands that Parry wake up, to no avail, and finally promises to undertake the dangerous mission.", "Using Parry's plans and notes, Jack makes use of a slingshot to carry a rope and anchor to a parapet and the high tower of the castle. He makes it inside and creeps down the long staircase. About halfway down, he sees the man who shot Parry's wife and recoils at the hallucination. Jack finds the castle's study and the Grail, which turns out to be a trophy given to a \"Lanny Carmichael\". Jack hears a noise behind him and finds Carmichael slumped in an easy chair by the fireplace, having taken an overdose of medication. Jack tries unsuccessfully to wake the man up, choosing instead to leave by the front door, tripping the security alarm.", "Jack once again visits Parry and gives him the cup. Exhausted, Jack slumps on Parry's bed and falls asleep. Some time later, Parry's fingers, holding the cup, begin to caress it. Parry wakes up and tells Jack that he really misses his wife.", "The next day, Lydia visits Parry and finds his bed empty. Parry and Jack are leading the other patients in a rousing rendition of \"How About You?\". Parry sees Lydia crying and hugs her, asking her why she looks so sad. Jack continues to lead the other patients in song.", "Jack goes to Anne's store and reconciles with her, admitting he loves her. She slaps him but accepts him back into her life. The story ends with Jack and Parry nude in Central Park, watching the clouds and laughing."]},

This was a P.O.W. camp like no other. There were no walls or barbed-wire fences, for the simple reason that there was no place for the prisoners to which to escape. Included among the prisoners is the American Corporal King (George Segal), a wheeler-dealer who has managed to established a pretty good life for himself in the camp. While most of the prisoners are near starvation and have uniforms that are in tatters, King eats well and and has crisp clean clothes to wear every day. His nemesis is Lieutenant Robin Grey (Sir Tom Courtenay), the camp Provost who attempts to keep good order and discipline. He knows that King is breaking camp rules by bartering with the Japanese, but can't quite get the evidence he needs to stop him. King soon forms a friendship with Lieutenant Peter Marlowe (James Fox), an upper class British officer who is fascinated with King's style and no-rules approach to life. As the story develops, it reveals the hypocrisy of the British class system and for King, the fact that his position in Changi's \"society\" is tenuous as best.", "The Japanese prisoner-of-war camp Changi in Singapore, which houses Allied P.O.W.s, is a living hell. The great mass of P.O.W.s are living at a sub-human subsistence level. U.S. Army Corporal King (George Segal) has been living up to his surname, through his control of the camp's black market, and by scamming the officers and other P.O.W.s. King has a facility for making deals with the Japanese to obtain the contraband he sells to the P.O.W.s. His nemesis is British Lieutenant Robin Grey (Sir Tom Courtenay), the camp Provost Marshal, a humorless, intense martinet who survives through his strict adherence to the British articles of war, which forbid collaboration with the enemy. He is suspicious of King, and is determined to catch him and bring him to justice. The humorless Grey is an upright, uptight moral prig who has been as badly damaged psychologically as any of the other P.O.W.s. The high-living King befriends a genteel young British airman, Peter Marlowe (James Fox), who at first, resists his blandishments, and then succumbs, to his charm. The P.O.W.s become aware that the war is drawing to its end, and King and Marlowe grow concerned that the brutal Japanese guards may slaughter the prisoners before they can be liberated. King and Marlowe are determined to raise a large amount of money to buy their freedom by bribing their captors. One of the schemes that King devises is to sell the meat of mouse deer, a native delicacy, to sell to the high-ranking P.O.W. officers. Conditions are so desperate in the camp, that P.O.W.s are stealing rations form one another in order to stave off starvation. This is another one of King's scams, as the \"mouse deer\" meat is actually from rats, the breeding stock for which have been the rats that have fed off the corpses of dead P.O.W.s. The desperate situation in the camp is exacerbated by the brutality of the Japanese guards, and by the senior British officers' predilection for breaking the will of the P.O.W.s in order to maintain camp discipline. Resistance, thus, is futile, and with no other outlet, the animosity of the P.O.W.s has to be channelled against each other. It becomes quite apparent that, aside from Lieutenant Grey and the dead, everyone in the camp is corrupt. Corporal King merely stands out, as he is Jack-the-Lad, The King-of-the-Hill, King of the Camp, King Rat.", "George Segal plays Corporal King, an American soldier in a Japanese prison camp who manages all the black market operations amongst the enforced holding of a group of English and Americans. His demeanor and bearing stand out in contrast to the rag tag prisoners he shares the camp with in part because of his willingness to ostensibly advance on the needs of others. He is constantly scrutinized by Lieutenant Grey (Tom Courtenay), the camp police chief, as he has gotten reports that King has robbed fellow prisoners in a poker game. It is clear that King takes pleasure in living on what would be considered a clear example of the American Capitalist version of supply and demand. He seeks ways to increase his organization by recruiting talented men like Peter Marlowe (James Fox), an English soldier who speaks fluent Malay, but refuses King's offering of money for his services. Marlowe attempts to live by a code that bonds men in a way that transcends any financial gain, and in fact considers King an actual friend because he and the American are interned together under Japanese rule. King extends his operation to include trading valuables to the Japanese and breeding rats to sell as food to the officers as a delicacy, activities that Marlowe is happy to aid in because of the smart commercial way that the schemes are launched. The ability to gain valuable items including medical supplies becomes important when Marlowe injures himself and faces serious physical danger. As Lieutenant Grey closes in to mete out the camp law enforcement, his code of conduct conflicts with Marlowe, his cabin mate. Theirs is a philosophy differing slightly and both based on survival with the most reaffirming respect for fellow man they can develop under these war conditions. As Grey attempts to arrest King and Marlowe for their criminal activity it becomes clear that the commanding officers live by a fractured value system."]},

However, the unsophisticated and religious townspeople are beside themselves with silent fear... continuing to believe that \"the witch\" is responsible for the killings and she is doing so from beyond the grave with a curse over the whole town.", "Patrizia herself briefly becomes a suspect when Martelli finds her gold-plated cigarette lighter at the scene of the latest killing and while being interrogated by the police, she refuses to supply an alibi for those nights of each killing.

With little to hold her on, the police let her go as well.", "Martelli and Patrizia become more determined to track down the killer on their own. During further meetings with Don Alberto, Martelli also learns that Don Alberto's mother has another young child, a six-year-old girl born mentally retarded. Martelli becomes convinced that the little girl is a witness to the killings after seeing that she compulsively pulls the heads off her dolls, as if doing an imitation to the strangulation's. One doll's head, that of Donald Duck, is found near the latest crime scene, which this leap of reason proves accurate. But Martelli and Patrizia wonder: is the killer the priest or his mother?", "When Aurelia disappears with her daughter, Martelli and Patrizia track her down to a remote shack on a hill overlooking the town and when they arrive, Aurelia is found barely conscious begging them to help her stop her crazy son. It is Don Alberto who is the killer. It turns out that he straggled those young boys not for their sins, but to PREVENT them from committing sin when they grow up, as well as save them from the \"horrors of sexuality\", thus (in his mind) sending them to heaven with clean souls.", "In an act contrary to even his sick rationale, he attempts to throw his little sister, a witness to the crimes, off a remote cliff. Martelli arrives in the nick of time, and after a long and climatic fistfight between Martelli and Don Alberto, the twisted priest looses his balance and falls of the cliff to his gruesome death."]},

Their gang is held responsible for attacking the Hopkins farm, raping pregnant Mrs. Hopkins and murdering the whole family. Arthur Burns (Danny Huston), the eldest brother and the gang's mastermind, remains on the loose and has retreated to a mountain hideout. Captain Stanley's proposition to Charlie is to gain pardon and, more importantly, save his beloved younger brother Mike from the gallows by finding and killing Arthur within nine days.", "Set in the Australian outback in the 1880s, the movie follows the series of events following the horrific rape and murder of the Hopkins family, allegedly committed by the infamous Burns brothers gang.", "The film opens in a brothel during a violent gunfight between the police and Charlie Burns' (Guy Pearce) gang, which ends with the deaths of all of the gang members except for Charlie and his younger brother Mikey. Captain Stanley (Ray Winstone) proposes to Charlie: he and Mikey can go free of the crimes they have committed if Charlie kills his older brother, Arthur (Danny Huston). Arthur is a mercurial psychopath who has become something of a legend and is so vicious that the Aboriginal tribes refer to him as \"The Dog Man\" and both the police and the Aboriginals refuse to go near his camp. Captain Stanley muses that perhaps the bounty hunters will kill Arthur in time and then states his intention to civilize the harsh Australian wilderness by bringing Arthur to justice and using Mikey as leverage. Charlie has nine days to find and kill Arthur, or else Mikey will be hanged from the gallows on Christmas Day.", "We discover why Captain Stanley is intent on taming Australia: he has been forced to move there with his delicate wife, Martha Stanley (Emily Watson), and apparently wants to make it an appropriate place for them to live. The Stanleys were also friends of the Hopkins family, leading Martha to have nightmares about her dead friends and the unborn child one of them is revealed to have carried. Word spreads of Stanley's deal with Charlie, primarily from Stanley's corrupt subordinate, Sergeant Lawrence (Robert Morgan), causing disgust among the townspeople.", "Shortly thereafter, Eden Fletcher (David Wenham), for whom Captain Stanley works, orders that Mikey be given one hundred lashes as punishment for the rape and murder of the Hopkins family. Stanley is aghast at this, not only because he believes that Mikey is innocent and the flogging will surely kill him, but because it would also break his deal with Charlie and thus put him and his wife in grave danger. Stanley sends Sergeant Lawrence away with tracker Jacko (David Gulpillil) and other men to \"investigate\" the reported slaying of Dan O'Riley by a group of Aborigines. Captain Stanley attempts to defend Mikey by gunpoint from the bloodthirsty townspeople, but is overruled once Martha arrives, insisting on revenge for her dead friends. Mikey is then brutally flogged, and horrifically wounded. The formerly excited townspeople slowly become disgusted and Martha faints at the ghastly display. After 40 lashes, Mikey has collapsed and the whip is soaked with blood. Captain Stanley grabs the whip and throws it at Fletcher, staining his face and suit with blood, who in turn fires Stanley.", "Meanwhile, Charlie rides a great distance in search of Arthur, drinking and apparently reflecting on what he will do. Along the way, he encounters an inebriated old man named Jellon Lamb (John Hurt). In the course of conversation, Charlie realizes that Lamb is a bounty hunter in pursuit of the Burns brothers and knocks him out. Later on, after sleeping on a rock bed, Charlie awakes and, before he can gather what's going on, is speared in the chest by a group of Aboriginal men standing over him. Seconds later a gunshot is heard and the head of the man who threw the spear explodes. Charlie then passes out.", "Charlie wakes up in the camp of his brother Arthur, which is located in caves among desolate mountains. Arthur's gang consists of Samuel Stoat (Tom Budge), who shot the Aboriginal man who had speared Charlie; a woman named Queenie (Leah Purcell) who tends to Charlie's wound; and a muscular Aboriginal man called Two-Bob (Tom E. Lewis). As he recovers from his wounds, Charlie has several opportunities to kill his brother, but does not. Not too far away from Arthur's camp, Sergeant Lawrence and his men have found and butchered a group of Aborigines. Arthur and Two-Bob find Lawrence's group while they sleep, ostensibly to get a horse for Charlie, and proceed to kill Jacko and Sergeant Lawrence. Before Arthur stomps Lawrence to death with his boot, Lawrence tells Arthur that Charlie has been sent to kill him. While this occurs, Jellon Lamb enters Arthur's camp and ties up Samuel and Charlie, both of whom are sleeping. Without his realizing it, Lamb is shot from behind by the returning Arthur. Arthur then proceeds to begin torturing the still-living Lamb with a knife, but Charlie instead performs a mercy-killing.", "Charlie decides that he wants to break out Mikey and informs Arthur. Arthur, Samuel and Charlie ride into town dressed in the clothes taken from the officers Arthur and Two-Bob had killed, pulling behind them Two-Bob, posing as an Aborigine that they've captured. Once at the jail, the men free Mikey, and Charlie and Two-Bob ride off with him. Arthur and Samuel remain to slaughter the two officers inside the jail. The badly injured Mikey, who has never recovered from the flogging, dies in Charlie's arms. As they bury Mikey, Two-Bob tells Charlie that all of this is Charlie's fault: \"You should never have left us.\"", "Captain Stanley and Martha, who had become increasingly paranoid as they were ostracized by the townspeople after the flogging, let their guard down to have a peaceful, civilized Christmas dinner. Immediately following their conclusion of grace, Arthur and Samuel shoot open the door and invade their home. Arthur pulls Captain Stanley into the other room and brutally beats him, while Samuel taunts his wife. Arthur then calls Samuel to the room. Samuel drags Martha inside, and Arthur shoots Captain Stanley through the shoulder. As Samuel rapes Martha, Charlie walks in and informs Arthur of Mikey's death; Arthur ignores the news and encourages Charlie to listen to Samuel's beautiful singing. Charlie walks up to the unsuspecting Samuel and shoots him point blank in the head, then shoots Arthur twice, saying afterward, \"No more.\" After this Arthur staggers out of the house. Charlie looks at a gun on the table that could potentially be picked up to shoot him, and then tells Captain Stanley \"I want to be with my brother.\" Charlie leaves the house and follows a trail of blood to find Arthur hunched over on a hill nearby and sits down next to him. Arthur states that Charlie has finally stopped him and asks what he will do now, to no answer, and then slowly dies as his brother watches the blood red sunset of the outback."]},

Karol takes another job as as a bodyguard in a seemingly innocent cash exchange office. Mikoaj meets Karol in a Warsaw Metro tunnel for the execution of the \"suicide\", it turns out to be that Mikoaj is the intended victim and asks Karol to kill him. Karol shoots a blank into Mikoaj's chest and asks him if he really wants to go through with it as the next bullet is real. Mikoaj refuses and is able to feel alive again. Using his position as a deceptively foolish bodyguard, Karol spies on his bosses and discovers their scheme to purchase different pieces of land that they knew were going to be targeted by big companies for development and resell for large profits. Karol beats them to it, and then tells his ex-bosses that if they kill him all his estate shall go to the Catholic Church, and they are therefore forced to purchase all the land from him. With the money he gained from this scheme and with the payment from Mikoaj, the two go into business (of a vaguely defined but possibly illegal nature) together.", "Karol becomes ruthlessly ambitious, focusing his energies on money-making schemes while learning to speak French and brooding over his wife's abandonment. He uses his new financial influence in a world where, as several characters observe, \"you can buy anything\" to execute a complex scheme to first win back Dominique, and then destroy her life.", "Karol takes his revenge against his ex-wife by faking his own death after which she shows up for his funeral. Karol then sneaks into her hotel room and has sex with her to prove his potency again. Then afterwords, Dominique is arrested and imprisoned for his 'murder'.

Karol then suddenly feels ashamed at himself for this revenge plot against his wife and openly cries... realizing that he must finally let go of her in order to move on with his own life."]},

It's a beautiful compilation of both worlds, Italy and Albania, on social conditions, promise of a better future, business partnership, adaptation to a new world. Characters speak either Italian or Albanian or both. Spiro Tozaj, the Albanian name of a dual character, is a political prisoner - a true Italian World War II prisoner who admits he deserted to be with his family - lost track of time and events of the world. In his mind, he still has a boy, Giovanni, of 3-4 years old, and a wife, Rosa. In reality, about 50 years have elapsed. Originally from Sicily, he ended up in an Albanian prison and eventually, a home for elderly people. The racketeers are erroneously recruiting him thinking he's an honest Albanian with no relatives, the perfect candidate for business, giving hope to local Albanians for an honest business of a shoes company, Alba Calzature, a money laundering business. While Gino, the Paisa' (short for 'paisano', peasant, as Spiro calls him) starts an adventure on Albanian territory trying to bring the old man to Italy, he learns that his true name is Michele Tallaricoof, a Sicilian. Personal trouble comes upon both when they separate, the old man almost losing his life in an incident where children almost asphyxiated him with smoke. As he's trying to move on towards Italy, other incidents along the way make the characters grow, communicate and discover true introspection into what life really is. Roles shift onto making the old man become the wise one who finally speaks and gives words of wisdom to the young ones. Trouble comes Gino's way when the business falls apart and he ends up in a jail himself. His precious freedom is negotiated for the head of a corrupt Albanian, Dr Kruja - Mr Croce - and his eventual departure to America brings Gino new endeavors, hopes, dreams and introspection into his own solitude. God made both Catholics meet again on the ship to America where they realize they need each other the most."]},

After weighing the options, strategically minded Miles decides on what he assumes is the day of the holdup that he will secretly pilfer the day's deposits, including Fogelman's, and hand over only the start of the day float to the robber, who he will do whatever to allow get away so that he himself can pocket the day's deposits without detection.

Before entering the complex, the team encounters a man from the 7th floor whose wife is ill, but he escapes their custody soon after entering the building. Starting from the ground floor and moving up, they slowly and tactfully infiltrate the apartment block until they reach the sixth floor. The team is spotted by a child who raises the alarm before he is shot and killed by Lt. Wahyu.", "Tama, watching the police on CCTV, cuts the lights off and announces to the whole block that he will grant sanctuary to those who kill the SWAT team. Meanwhile, Sgt. Jaka learns that the mission was not sanctioned by the department, only by Lieutenant Wahyu, thus no reinforcements or rescue will come. Worse still, the SWAT van is disabled and the building is surrounded by snipers who will kill anyone trying to escape. After a lengthy battle across a darkened stairwell, the team retreats to a nearby apartment and attempt to break through to the floor below. In the ensuing battle, Alee is killed and Bowo is injured, to save him, Rama, with the help from Dagu, uses a grenade, gas canister and fridge as a makeshift bomb, killing everyone in the hallway.", "The SWAT members that survived the ambush are: Sgt. Jaka, Lt. Wahyu, Bowo, Dagu and Rama. After recovering from the gas explosion, the team split into two groups: Jaka, Wahyu and Dagu on the 5th floor and Rama escorting a wounded Bowo to safety on the 7th floor. Meanwhile, Tama sends Andi and Mad Dog to join the hunt for the survivors. However, Andi kills his two escorts in an elevator for reasons yet to be explained.", "Rama and Bowo go to the only place they know to be safe; room 726, belonging to the man they met earlier. Having narrowly avoided detection by a machete-wielding gang, Rama leaves Bowo there to recover and heads off to find the others, but is eventually spotted by the machete gang. He barely survives the attack and as he staggers along the hallway, he is pulled aside by a familiar face. Elsewhere, Jaka works out that Wahyu is being paid to get rid of Tama, not arrest him. But before Wahyu confesses his mission to kill Tama,the group are found by Mad Dog and his men. Mad Dog holds Jaka at gunpoint while his gang pursue Wahyu; Jaka orders Dagu to protect Wahyu and he does so. Mad Dog captures Jaka but rather than shooting him dead in cold blood (revealing that shooting enemies dead is not his best hobby), Mad Dog challenges Jaka to a hand to hand combat. They both fight in a hand to hand combat where Mad Dog apparently defeats Jaka before killing him by snapping neck.", "Rama's 'rescuer' is revealed to be Andi, his estranged brother who chose to leave the family and left no trace of his whereabouts. It was only during the mission briefing that Rama even knew of his part in Tama's gang. He tries to persuade his brother to come home and tells him about his wife's pregnancy. But Andi isn't swayed and leaves Rama to wait in his apartment, while he meets up with Mad Dog, dragging the corpse of Jaka to be presented to Tama. But when reporting back to his boss, Andi's betrayal is discovered and Tama stabs him through the hand before turning him over to Mad Dog for torture (it's also suggested that he'll be used as bait for Rama).", "Rama regroups with Wahyu and Dagu and assaults the drug lab further up in the building and then on to the 15th floor where Tama is located. Rama is separated when he finds his brother and Mad Dog, who allows Andi to be untied, so he can challenge them both. The three men engage in a lengthy brawl, with Mad Dog easily holding his ground. Meanwhile Wahyu steals the gun of one of Tama's goons and kills him and two other goons before holding Tama at gunpoint, Tama is arrested but he is surprised when Wahyu betrays Dagu and kills him in cold blood, Wahyu then takes Tama hostage in order to claim his escape. In the battle, Mad Dog defeats Andi and injures Rama, but before he can kill him, Andi stabs Mad Dog with a sharp object but still, Mad Dog stays strong before Rama finally overpowers him and slashes his throat with the sharp object stuck to his throat, finally killing him.", "Together, Rama and Andi catch up with Wahyu, who tries to kill them too, making Rama realize that Dagu didn't make it. Tama gloats to Wahyu about his situation and explains that the lieutenant is actually the one who's been set up to be killed. Just then, Tama begins to mention Reza, he reveals that Reza betrayed the lieutenant by having him set up by his corrupt higher ups before Tama reveals he had paid off the right people to ensure his own survival. Meaning that even though that Wahyu does survive and escape here, he will be killed later. Panicked and feeling threatened enough, Wahyu ends this by killing Tama with a gunshot but his efforts to commit suicide fail because his gun is out of bullets.", "In the aftermath, Wahyu is arrested, Rama reunites with Bowo and Andi orders the building's residents to stand down and provides Rama with information on all the corrupt cops, thanks to recordings that the extremely paranoid Tama had in his possession; including numerous of his blackmail recordings on corrupt officers taking ribes. Andi then walks Rama, Bowo and Wahyu to the front gate, but declines Rama's offer to join them. The cops head away and Andi returns to an uncertain future as the film ends."]},

Soon after arriving, Frank is summoned to the office of the warden (Patrick McGoohan), who warns him that Alcatraz is unique within the U.S. prison system for its exceedingly high level of security.

On a rock by the shore, he finds a chrysanthemum and throws it in the water. The fates of Frank, Clarence and John are left unknown even after an extensive investigation by the FBI."]},

In a room dripping with artificial lighting, Hugo shows Andreas the small light to another world that emanates from a hole in the wall.

Less than ten days later, Escobar was gunned down outside a bar in a suburb of Medellin. He was shot 12 times, and the murderer shouted \"goal\" each time the trigger was pulled.

Andres Escobar was the biggest soccer star in Colombia. The two were not related, but their fates were inextricably-and fatally-intertwined. Pablo's drug money had turned Andres' national team into South American champions, favored to win the 1994 World Cup in Los Angeles. It was there, in a game against the U.S., that Andres committed one of the most shocking mistakes in soccer history, scoring an \"own goal\" that eliminated his team from the competition and ultimately cost him his life. The Two Escobars is a riveting examination of the intersection of sports, crime, and politics. For Colombians, soccer was far more than a game: their entire national identity rode on the success or failure of their team.

In order to keep law and order out of Bottleneck, Judge Slade appoints the town drunk and apparently incompetent Washington Dimsdale (Charles Winninger) to be the new sheriff.

Destry straps on his guns and goes looking for those responsible. A large brawl erupts, and Frenchy changes her allegiances once more, catching a bullet for the otherwise doomed deputy. Destry, as formidable as his father, vanquishes the outlaws and cleans up Bottleneck.

Familiar with Gulley's determined and imaginative attempts to con him out of the paintings or money, Hickson refuses all of the painter's calls. Gulley then turns to pub owner \"Cookie\" D. Coker for a loan, and explains his intention to retrieve his paintings in order to sell them to art aficionado Sir William Beeder. When Gulley assures Cookie that he will pay his outstanding bar bill in full once he makes the sale, she agrees to a small loan. The next morning, concern over her investment prompts Cookie to visit Gulley on board his houseboat home where she insists that he demand his share of the painting proceeds from Sarah. Gulley reluctantly agrees, but when they arrive at Sarah's, the painter falls into a romantic reverie recalling the early days of his marriage. When Sarah explains that she sold Gulley's works to pay off his enormous debt, Cookie insists that Sarah has swindled Gulley.

Gulley then visits art patrons Lord and Lady Beeder at their luxury apartment where he learns from their private secretary, A. W. Arnold Alabaster, that the couple is leaving on a six-week trip to Bermuda the following day. Captivated by a large bare wall in the Beeder's apartment, Gulley offers to sell Sir William the Woman in the Bath and paint a mural of the resurrection of Lazarus on the wall for free. Sir William, a close friend of Hickson's, agrees to consider the offer, but wonders how Gulley will get the painting.

Later, Gulley's enthusiastic drinking results in his passing out and he is carried to Arnold's room. Awakening the following day to discover that the Beeders have departed, Gulley persuades the house cleaner to give him the apartment keys. Dressed in Sir William's clothes, Gulley convinces the skeptical concierge that he is staying at the Beeders' with their permission, then sneaks out to pawn their valuable clock. With the help of a young painting apprentice and friend named Nosey, Gulley rounds up a number of props and various models for his mural. After several days, fellow artist and sculptor Abel discovers that Gulley is living at the Beeders' apartment, and, to the painter's annoyance, insists upon sharing the luxurious digs. Despite Gulley's protestations, Abel moves in and arranges for the delivery of an enormous marble block, which crashes through the top floor of the apartment. Undeterred, Abel takes up sculpting and Nosey tends to the men and their models. Several weeks later, Abel and Gulley quarrel about the merit of their finished works and Gulley sadly agrees that his mural does not live up to his expectations. When the Beeders return, they are stunned by the condition of their apartment and Gulley hastily returns to his houseboat. He discovers Cookie there, as she has lost her pub and apartment due to her association with an \"ex-con.\" Saddened by Cookie's news that Hickson has passed away, Gulley is then startled to find out that Hickson willed his paintings to the nation. Days later at the Hickson exhibition of his paintings, Gulley runs into Sarah, and, hoping to wheedle her out of the Woman in the Bath, takes her home. Sarah passes a package off as the painting, but after Gulley realizes she has tricked him, he returns, yet Sarah refuses to surrender the painting. Angry and frustrated, Gulley moves out of his houseboat to an abandoned building scheduled for demolition. Hoping to inspire Gulley to resume painting, Nosey points out a large bare wall in the building and soon Gulley is planning another mural, offering lessons in exchange for students providing supplies and help in painting his rendition of Noah's ark. The completed project so impresses the neighbors that they unite to prevent the building's demolition. To spare the workmen feeling guilty, Gulley then destroys the wall with a bulldozer. Pleased to have united the community in an appreciation of art and determined to continue living in his own way, Gulley then returns to his houseboat and, as Cookie and Nosey wave goodbye, sails down the Thames alone in search of more artistic adventures."]},

Danaher, however, holds a grudge. When Thornton arranges to court Danaher's sister, Mary Kate, the real fun begins. Thornton learns that Ireland's quaint charm includes some old-fashioned rules of courtship. He needs Squire Danaher's consent to marry Mary Kate, since their father is deceased. He and the local shaughraun (matchmaker), Michaleen Flynn, pay a formal visit to Danaher to ask for Mary Kate's hand. Danaher refuses and orders the two men out of his house. Sean and Mary Kate are devastated. Sean is puzzled by social rules that seem archaic to him, and takes out his frustrations by seemingly reckless cross country rides. Concerned, Thornton's newfound friends - Flynn, Reverend Playfair (Arthur Shields), and Father Lonergan (Ward Bond) - concoct a plot to trick Danaher into consenting to the marriage. They lead Danaher to believe Sean is courting the widow Tillane, who will have nothing to do with Danaher until Mary Kate is married off and out of the house.

Tension builds in Innisfree, a highly sporting community, as the townspeople hope for a fight between Thornton and Danaher. However, Thornton refuses to fight. He suffers the guilt of a terrible secret concerning his last prize fight, which only the Reverend Playfair knows.", "As tensions grow, Father Lonergan counsels Mary Kate about her duties as a married woman, as Reverend Playfair councils Sean about what the dowry means to his wife. Although Mary Kate acquiesces, she feels that the dowerless marriage is improper and leaves Sean. To Sean, this is the last straw. He goes to the train station, literally drags his wife back to Squire Danaher's farm, collecting a very large crowd along the way, as the neighboring towns realize that Sean is about to confront Will Danaher and demands Mary Kate's dowry. Danaher refuses to pay the dowry, so Sean calls off the marriage - claiming that the dowry is their custom, not his. Shamed in front of the whole county, Danaher gives up the dowry (350 pounds cash). To further prove a point Sean stalks over to the nearby threshing furnace, where Mary Kate open the door for Sean to throw the money into the fire. This infuriates Danaher and he takes a swing at Sean, who defends himself. Mary Kate sees that her husband is willing to fight and heads home to cook dinner.", "For the rest of nearby residents of Innesfree, farmhands, the train engineers and passengers who've stayed for the event, the long awaited fight breaks out - starting at Danaher's farm and heading into Innesfree. During this Sean learns Danaher is, indeed, a worthy opponent. Many a side bets are laid - including Reverend Playfair, the visiting Bishop, and the local constabulary. By the end, the two men respect each other and have become fast (if drunken) friends. After the fight, the town gathers together to also help save Reverend Playfair's job and Will Danaher starts formally courting the Widow Tellane."]},

Tucker tells Frady that it's probably nothing, but Tucker also explains that he cannot shake the feeling that the second waiter looks familiar. A few minutes later, the boat explodes from a bomb hidden in the cabin. Frady sitting on the bow of the boat jumps overboard, while Tucker and his aide, catching the full blast, are killed.", "Frady meets with Rintels and tells him about what happened and Rintels agrees to help Frady with his story. Using his alias, Frady checks himself into a fleabag motel in downtown Los Angeles, and a few days later a certain 'Jack Younger' (Walter McGinn), claiming to be a representative of the Parallax Corporation, contacts Frady in his room and says that his aggressiveness (as shown on the test answers) makes him valuable for certain corporations. Younger asks Frady/Richard Paley to join the corporation for the 'special projects' division.", "Frady goes to the Parallax offices in downtown L.A. and meets with Mr. Younger who shows him a special room where Frady is 'tested' with a series of brainwashing techniques with him being shown various photos and images of death and destruction as if to make him suitable for indoctrination. Frady becomes aware that this branch of the Parallax is a training ground for assassins.", "As Frady is leaving the building for the day when his 'tests' are finished, he spots the second waiter from the Tucker photo talking to some businessmen. Frady follows the second waiter/assassin outside to his car and tails him driving around the city. The assassin switches cars with another person, and obtains a briefcase which he takes to the local airport.", "The assassin checks himself on a plane to Chicago, and Frady checks himself on the same plane. The plane takes off, but the assassin does not board for he has apparently checked in his briefcase which has a bomb in it. On the plane, Frady sees that that assassin is nowhere to be found, and after seeing that a prominent senator on board, realizes that the plane must have a bomb on board. After trying to sneak a message on a restroom mirror, Frady anonymously passes a note on a napkin to a stewardess that a bomb is on board. The stewardess relays the news to the pilot who immediately returns the plane to Los Angeles. After everyone has disembarked, the plane explodes (off-camera).", "Frady returns to his seedy motel room to find Mr. Younger waiting for him and he informs Frady that Parallax have already had an offer of employment for Frady, but he immediately expresses suspicion as a background check made by Parallax on Frady showed that some of his references were false. Frady then makes up a new alias for Younger explaining that he's an alcoholic and lied on his background to land a job. Younger offers to look into it and again promises Frady that Parallax is a great opportunity for people like him, and then leaves.", "Realizing that it will only be a matter of time before they discover his real identity, Frady secretly mails the Parallax test papers and an audiotape he made on a mini-tape recorder of his conversation with Younger to Rintels. Along with it is a note from Frady who explains that he may be in way over his head and that if anything were to happen to him, that Rintels should publish this information about Parallax and what they do on the sidelines of recruiting assassins to kill prominent officials who threaten or get too close to the corporation's nefarious plans. Rintels listens to the tape and finally realizes that Frady is onto something big. Rintels, who practically lives in his office and orders take-out food every day from a deli across the street, orders more food as he reviews more of the papers Frady has mailed to him. Just then, the deli delivery guy arrives with Rintels' latest food order. The delivery guy is the Parallax assassin in disguise. The next morning, Rintels is found dead by his employees in his office, dead from an apparent \"heart attack\" after he was poisoned. The evidence is gone and the audio tape has been erased.", "In Los Angeles, Frady, unaware of Rintels' murder and that he is now on his own, gets his first assignment to meet with his new co-worker at a local hotel for their \"assignments\". Frady sneaks out of the planned meeting place and goes to Parallax's offices asking to meet with Mr. Younger, but is told that Younger is out. Frady spots the Parallax assassin and follows him into the hallways of the L.A. Convention Center. Mr. Younger is there with more Parallax businessmen/assassins where they are talking about their latest plans. Frady watches them from a distance as Mr. Younger leaves and the Parallax assassin and a few others go to the platforms above the floor of the convention hall.", "Frady sees that down below a dress rehearsal where Senator George Hammond (Jim Davis), a prominent California senator, is rehearsing a speech he will give that night. Frady believes that the assassin is going to shoot the senator with a rifle that he loads and lies down on the walkway above the convention hall. Then, just as Senator Hammond is planning to leave before he makes his appearance, the assassin suddenly leaves, leaving Frady in hiding on the walkway, alone and locked in the area. Suddenly, shots ring out as one of the assassins shoots and kills Hammond with a second rifle from a concealed location, just as Hammond is riding in a golf cart out of the convention hall. Everyone looks up and around for the shooter, and sees Frady.... standing on the plank way above them near the unused rifle. THEY THINK HE DID IT!!!! Frady realizes (way too late) that he's been set up! Frady hides under the plank way as three Parallax security guards/assassins show up looking for him. When police sirens are heard, the three assassins flee, leaving the door to the exit wide open. After a few minutes, Frady tries to run for the exit, when the assassin appears as a menacing silhouette in the doorway (anticipating that Frady would do just that) and guns him down.", "Several months later, a second seven-man congressional commission is held where the lead commissioner reports that Frady had blamed Senator Hammond for the Senator Carroll assassination and had sought revenge. (Note: it is never explained if any of both the seven-man commissions are in league with Parallax, or if they are only easily duped into believing the fabricated evidence.) The commission rules that there is no evidence of a conspiracy in the killing of Senator Hammond. Frady was the lone assassin. Case closed. The commission does not take questions from the unseen press."]},

As such, he wants to direct his just completed third play, \"God of Our Fathers\", insider scuttlebutt being that it may very well make David the toast of Broadway. With David having no directing history, David's regular producer, Julian Marx, can't find any investors,... until a single investor who will finance the entire production comes onto the scene. He is Nick Valenti, a big time mobster, with the catch being that his dimwitted girlfriend, non-actress Olive Neal, get the lead role. A hesitant David and Julian, who are able to talk Nick into them giving Olive one of the two female supporting roles instead, go along with the scheme hoping that the three other actors hired will be able to make up for any deficiencies posed by Olive. What makes Olive's situation worse for David is that Nick has placed a bodyguard named Cheech - a typical thug who kills if need be - on Olive, he a constant presence at the theater during rehearsals. David is unaware or mindfully ignorant of issues concerning the other actors. Helen Sinclair, who has the lead, is a diva of an actress, who hasn't had a hit in years. Regardless, she is slyly manipulating David to make the role more glamorous befitting her real life persona than the frigid character he has written. Gossip is that Warner Purcell, the only male among the cast, has a roller coaster of a weight problem. Currently on a low, Warner tends to eat and eat and eat when when he gets stressed. And Eden Brent, a happy-go-lucky actress, has a constant companion in her pet chihuahua, Mr. Woofulls, whose presence is a constant thorn in Helen's side.

Now these two con-men and Thakur will be forced to quit their mission or continue risking innocent villages' lives.", "Two convicts and small time crooks (Amitabh and Dharmendra) are picked by Thakur (Sanjeev Kumar), a former police officer, to seek vengeance on the dangerous bandit Gabbar Singh (Amjad Khan) because he killed all of Thakur's family (except a daughter-in-law) and maimed Thakur for life.This was a result of an earlier incident in which Thakur -- acting as a police officer -- had captured Gabbar and helped in his conviction in the court. Gabbar managed to escape and wreaked havoc in Thakur's life. Now Thakur seeks the help of these two crooks to get Gabbar. The ensuing action makes for one of the most exciting Indian movies made to date.", "The film begins in a small village named Rampur, which is home to ex-policeman Thakur Baldev Singh (Sanjeev Kumar). He summons an old colleague and requests him to track down a pair of small-time thieves he had once apprehended in the line of duty. Though the two petty criminals Veeru (Dharmendra) and Jaidev (Amitabh Bachchan) are notorious, the Thakur feels that they would be the ideal men to help him end the tyranny of Gabbar Singh (Amjad Khan), an infamous outlaw wanted by the authorities for a 50,000 reward. After scenes show how the three fought together during a train robbery attempt, and how the criminals often get in and out of jail, and often settle their differences with a coin toss, Veeru and Jai are found and brought to Ramgarh.

They then state their intentions to leave the villagers to defend themselves, due to the Thakur's cowardice. Before they can leave, Thakur tells them the real reason of why he wants Gabbar, and why he could not help them. Some time ago, Thakur had caught Gabbar and had him imprisoned only for him to escape and plot an evil revenge. Gabbar made his way to the Thakur's home and killed most of his family. The only person to survive this massacre was Thakur's younger daughter-in-law, Radha (Jaya Bhaduri).", "Thakur tracked down Gabbar, but this time the tyrant held the upper hand due to his gang and cut off both of Thakur's arms. Thakur had hidden this disability from Veeru and Jai, but now it was clear why he could not physically help them in the first place.

The three escapes, but Jai is wounded by a gunshot, and with the bandits still following, they hide behind a rock at the foot of a bridge, due to shortage of ammunition. Jai orders Veeru to go back to the village with Basanti, and then return with some ammunition. Veeru, even though unaware of Jai's wound, hesitates, insisting that Jai return to the village instead, upon which Jai suggests that they resolve the matter by tossing a coin. The toss, as always seems to happen, is in Jai's favor, and Veeru heads back to the village with Basanti. Jai, slowly dying with only a few bullets remaining, manages to fend off advances by the bandits, and kills most of Gabbar's men.", "After failing in most of their advances (and unaware that Jai is alone), in one last attempt, the bandits throw a stick of dynamite, which lands on the bridge near him.

Veeru rubbishes the promise and is about to kill Gabbar anyway, when he is reminded that the promise was made by Jai and not him. Veeru tells Thakur that the only reason for him doing so was because it was Jai who made the promise, and leaves. Thakur then advances towards Gabbar, revealing spike-soled shoes, intended to torture Gabbar and beg for death. Thakur severely assaults Gabbar, destroying his hands, and is about to kill him, when the police intervene, reminding Thakur that he, too, was once a police officer and that Gabbar must be arrested and dealt with by the law. As Gabbar is taken away, Thakur is denied vengeance, but walks away with solace that Ramgarh is free.", "The film ends with Veeru, after Jai's funeral, leaving on a train. However, as he boards, he sees Basanti in one of the seats. As they embrace, the train steams off, with Thakur watching.\n(In the alternate ending to the film, Gabbar actually dies as he is kicked into a spike that is protruding from the posts where Thakur's arms were cut off.

The battle ends when Roat obtains light by opening the refrigerator, whose door he props open with a rag in the hinge. Susy, weeping (because she forgot about the refrigerator light), pulls the doll out of its hiding place and hands it to Roat. While Roat cuts open the doll and gloats over the treasure inside, Susy is able, unnoticed by him, to arm herself with a butcher knife.", "Roat then announces his intention to rape Susy, but, as he leads her to the bedroom, she manages to stab him in the belly. As she stumbles across the floor toward the kitchen window to scream for help, Roat leaps out from the darkened bedroom and grabs her ankle. Screaming, Susy wrenches free, but the dying Roat doggedly pursues her, using the knife with which she stabbed him to drag himself across the floor. Susy is at the refrigerator, trying to close its door and thus extinguish its light, unaware of the rag that is preventing its closure. She then gropes for the refrigerator's cord, murmuring desperately, \"Where is it?\" As the reeling Roat stands with his last strength and staggers toward her with the knife, the refrigerator light finally goes out, and Susy's scream merges with the sound of a police siren.", "The scene switches to the arrival of police cars outside the apartment. When the police enter with Sam and Gloria, Sam finds an unbroken light bulb, and we see the room littered with the bodies of Talman and Roat, but no Susy. Finally, as Sam calls out for her, the door of the unplugged refrigerator moves, and Susy emerges from behind it, shaken but alive."]},

Prew made the request on principle, as he was lead bugler in the corps, he known as the best, but it a position which was reassigned to another enlisted man based on nepotism. It is also on principle that Prew refuses to be part of Schofield's inter-regimental boxing team, it a sport he loved and was good at until an in-ring incident led to his friend being permanently injured, despite the incident not being Prew's fault. Regardless, Holmes and the boxing team members place pressure on Prew, including intimidation, to buckle under to the request. Warden begins an affair with the seductive Karen Holmes, Capt. Holmes' unhappy wife, the affair despite Karen having a reputation among the enlisted men, some who can attest to that reputation first hand.

At first, Galovitch repeatedly pummels Prewitt, who initially refuses to fight back, and then resorts to using only body blows. But as Galovitch and others watching continue taunting him, he begins boxing, hitting Galovitch in the face and nearly managing to knock him out before Holmes finally steps in and stops the fight. When Galovitch falsely accuses Prewitt of insubordination, Holmes is about to punish Prewitt again until the man in charge of the detail says that it was Galovitch, not Prewitt, who was spoiling for the fight. Instead of punishing Galovitch, Holmes abruptly lets him off the hook and disperses the crowd. The entire incident is witnessed by the base commander, who orders an investigation by the Inspector General. When Holmes' true intentions are revealed, the general orders a court-martial. When Holmes begs for an alternative, the commanding officer's aide suggests that Holmes resign his commission \"for the good of the service\" and leaves the Army, which the general accepts with dispatch.

During the walk back to the barracks, Prewitt is spotted by several jittery sentries on the lookout for saboteurs. Instead of stopping and identifying himself to the sentries, Prewitt attempts to run and gets shot dead while running across a golf course, his body landing in a nearby sand trap. Warden arrives on the scene a few minutes later with military investigators and identifies the body.

The result is a subversive collage of ideological (moving) images from socialist and capitalist societies that are presented here as artefacts of a global media 'spectacle': Social relations between people are mediated by artificial images and false representations that transform humans into mere passive consumers and 'spectators' of their alienated existence. Guy Debord's motivation was to create a radical social critique and a disruptive, anti-illusionist cinema as an antidote and revolutionary tool against the dominant cultural and sociopolitical forces of his time.", "Guy Debord's movie version of his own analysis of consumer society (society of spectacle in his terminology) which is now, 40 years after its release, even more relevant than it was back then."]},

Indeed, this fervent yearning for a wholesome life becomes real when the angelic Blue Fairy hears the romantic wish of kindly puppet-maker Geppetto and decides to vitalise Pinocchio, his inanimate creation. However, as all human beings are incomplete without a conscience, minuscule but wise Jiminy Cricket becomes Pinocchio's faithful companion and the voice of reason--an unshakable supporter entrusted with the crucial task of guiding the gullible boy through life's constant distractions. Now Pinocchio has everything he needs to succeed. Will the smiling boy made of enchanted pine wood manage to be brave, truthful, and unselfish?", "The film opens with Jiminy Cricket sitting in a library singing \"When You Wish Upon A Star\". Addressing the camera, he starts to tell the audience why he believes in such a thing. Opening up a storybook of \"Pinocchio\", he explains how he came to the house of woodcarver Geppetto and his pets Figaro the cat and Cleo the fish. Geppetto has just made a little wooden puppet called Pinocchio, whom he loves dearly (\"Little Wooden Puppet\"). Before he goes to bed, Geppetto wishes upon the evening star that Pinocchio would become a real, live boy. As Geppetto sleeps, the Blue Fairy arrives and grants the wish partially; Pinocchio has come to life, but he is still a puppet and must prove himself worthy before becoming a real boy. However, being naive, he requires some guidance, and the Blue Fairy appoints Jiminy Cricket to be his \"conscience\". The cricket tells Pinocchio that anytime he needs Jiminy, all he needs to do is whistle (\"Give a Little Whistle\").", "The next morning, Geppetto sends his son off to school. But Jiminy Cricket is still asleep! Pinocchio, alone and full of good intentions, heads off to school, but is sidetracked by the wily fox John Worthington Foulfellow and his simpleton accomplice Gideon the cat. Recognizing his uniqueness, the smooth-talking crooks decide to sell Pinocchio to marionette master Stromboli, whose travelling show is in town. Convincing Pinocchio that this is his chance to become an actor, Honest John and Gideon take the puppet to Stromboli (\"Hi-Diddle-Dee-Dee\"). Jiminy Cricket jumps in and tries to stop Pinocchio from being taken away, but he is too late; Pinocchio becomes a success as part of Stromboli's show, dancing alongside normal puppets in a European-themed musical extravaganza (\"I've Got No Strings\"). Jiminy Cricket, feeling that he failed at his job, walks off into the night.", "Pinocchio tries to return home to Geppetto. Stromboli, not wanting to lose such a cash cow, locks the puppet in a bird cage. Alone in Stromboli's dark and damp caravan, Pinocchio whistles for Jiminy Cricket. He finds Pinocchio, but is not strong enough to unlock the bird cage. Suddenly, the Blue Fairy appears. Not wanting to admit he was naughty, Pinocchio tells a series of lies, but with every lie his nose grows longer. The Blue Fairy forgives him and lets him out of the cage, but warns him that he'll never become human if he keeps misbehaving. (She also restores his nose to its original size.)", "Pinocchio and Jiminy Cricket escape from Stromboli and head for home. Yet it isn't long before the duo become separated, and once more Pinocchio bumps into Honest John and Gideon, who have been hired by a dubious coachman to round up boys to take to the anarchic Pleasure Island amusement park. Jiminy, realizing that once again he has been too late, follows Pinocchio to Pleasure Island, where boys can be naughty as much as they like and treat themselves to beer and cigars. But there's a catch to all this; since they are acting like jackasses, the magic of the island gradually turns them into donkeys, which the coachman sells into a lifetime of humiliation and slavery in circuses and mines. Pinocchio starts to change into a donkey, growing long ears and a tail, but before the transformation is complete he manages to flee the horrible amusement park, and returns home. To his dismay, his father isn't there.", "A dove arrives with a note from the Blue Fairy explaining that Geppetto has gone to sea to search for his lost son and has been swallowed by the whale Monstro.

Without regard for his own safety, Pinocchio saves Geppetto from drowning but at the cost of his own life. Geppetto's wish is finally granted. Pinocchio's sacrifice has proved to the Blue Fairy that he is worthy, and he is brought back to life not as a puppet but as a real live boy.", "While Geppetto, Pinocchio, Figaro and Cleo celebrate, Jiminy Cricket steps outside to look at the wishing star.

His career, however, has been going downhill, he not having had a hit movie in the last nine years, which is making him think his next film will be his last, something he has not confirmed publicly. He has just released part 1 of that film, \"The Jaguar Shark\". The title derived from an incident on what was his most ambitious expedition to date, where his professional partner and best friend of twenty-seven years, Esteban du Plantier (Seymour Cassel), was eaten alive by a ten meter long creature, which Steve had never seen before, but what he refers to as a jaguar shark. Because only Steve saw the creature and what happened to Esteban, some question if the creature truly exists and if Steve is making up the story. Regardless, Steve plans as part 2 of the documentary finding and destroying the creature that killed his friend. Three people who have never sailed with Steve will be joining the Team on this expedition: Bill Ubell (Bud Cort), his bond company's \"stooge\"; single, but pregnant reporter Jane Winslett-Richardson (Cate Blanchett), whose presence is important if only because Steve does care what the world thinks about him, despite often doing unlikable things; and Ned Plimpton (Owen Wilson), who works as a pilot for a backwater airline, and who the two believe may be Steve's biological son from a previous relationship. Despite Ned acknowledging that he is not a strong swimmer, he accepts Steve's offer to be an official member of the Team, which does not sit well with Team engineer Klaus Daimler (Willem Dafoe), who has always viewed himself as the son Steve never had. One Team member who will not be going along is Steve's wife, Eleanor Zissou (Anjelica Huston), who Steve refers to as a \"rich bitch\", who was once married to Steve's arch oceanography nemesis Alistair Hennessey (Jeff Goldblum), and who Steve will admit off the record is the true brains behind the operation. She views this expedition as reckless. Steve being able to focus on the mission at hand takes some turns based on other hazards of the sea, and the interactions between Steve, Ned and Jane, which adds complexity to their confined environment.", "In this movie, Bill Murray stars as the eponymous Steve Zissou, a famous oceanographer and documentary star. Not only that, but he also leads a crew aboard the Belafonte who often join him on his documentaries. For one such documentary, one of their latest endeavors leads to the tragic death of Zissou's assistant and best friend at the hands of an allegedly mysterious Jaguar Shark.

A powerful crime family is caught in a lethal crossfire between union organizers and brutal corporate bosses. Against this turbulent backdrop, the family's three street-hardened brothers and the women they love are about to be plunged into a deadly confrontation with their enemies, with each other, and with their own dark heritage of violence, madness and murder.", "Director Abel Ferrara puts his finger on the pulse of the world of sin. The Funeral is a dark portrait of a family \"not broken enough to believe in God\". The film opens in a movietheatre where Johnny Tempio (Vincent Gallo) is watching Humphrey Bogart talking about death. After the titles we find ourselves at the home of the Tempio family where a coffin is brought into the house. When the coffin is opened we see Johnny; he's dead. His oldest brother Ray (Christopher Walken) seems to be the head of the family. He's a gangster. Behind his ice cold gaze lives the hunger for revenge and strategic 'gangster-justice'. When Johnny's other brother Chez (Chris Penn) enters the house the mood seems to change from silence into rage and fear, for Chez is a man on the edge of insanity. Madness, rooted in pain and fed by anger. The movie progresses into a parallel structure where we follow the three brothers through flashbacks up against the present where the two remaining brothers are dealing with their loss. The movie is a depiction of gangster life, without the traditional glamour and romanticism. The more mainstream enjoyment and stylistic elements of the famous gangster films are dismissed and replaced by pain, suffering and hopelessness. The Funeral is a bleak but powerful film about the fate of sin. A film about a place in the world where redemption is far gone. As opposed to most of Ferrara's films The Funeral finds no salvation for the lead character(s). Chez, the insane man turns out to be the man that does the only sane thing. End this life of evil and immorality by the only means possible in his way of thinking."]},

When she qualifies for the prestigious Little Miss Sunshine beauty contest, the entire family embarks on a long road trip from Albuquerque to California in their 1978 Volkswagen Station Wagon Type 2. However, the journey is anything but smooth. As Sheryl, Olive's overworked mother, struggles to be the voice of reason, Richard, her unsuccessful husband, tries to promote his self-help program. To further complicate matters, Dwayne, Sheryl's son from a previous marriage, has decided not to utter a word until he joins the Air Force Academy. At least, troubled Uncle Frank just tags along. And on the road to success, anything that can go wrong will go wrong. What has the future in store for Olive? Does she stand a chance of fulfilling her dream?", "Olive is a little girl with a dream: winning the Little Miss Sunshine contest. Her family wants her dream to come true, but they are so burdened with their own quirks, neuroses, and problems that they can barely make it through a day without some disaster befalling them. Olive's father Richard is a flop as a motivational speaker, and is barely on speaking terms with her mother. Olive's uncle Frank, a renowned Proust scholar, has attempted suicide following an unsuccessful romance with a male graduate student. Her brother Dwayne, a fanatical follower of Nietzsche, has taken a vow of silence, which allows him to escape somewhat from the family whose very presence torments him. And Olive's grandfather is a ne'er-do-well with a drug habit, but at least he enthusiastically coaches Olive in her contest talent routine. Circumstances conspire to put the entire family on the road together with the goal of getting Olive to the Little Miss Sunshine contest in far off California.", "The Hoover family is the dictionary definition for the word \"dysfunctional\". The dad Richard is a man who gives lectures on winners and losers, the wife is Sheryl, a chain-smoking, frazzled wife and working mother whose idea of a home cooked meal frequently consists of a bucket of chicken. Her gay brother Frank recently attempted suicide. The grandpa is Edwin, a drug addict. The son is Dwayne a rebel who has vowed not to talk until he gets into the Air Force. And then there is Olive, a seven-year old girl who dreams of going to the Little Miss Sunshine pageant. So what happens when they do?", "During a strained and awkward family dinner, it is revealed that Frank, a homosexual professor and renowned scholar of Marcel Proust, tried to kill himself after a love interest left him for an academic rival. Cued by her father to change the subject, Olive tells the family about the beauty pageant routine she is working on with the help of her grandfather. Though Olive is not of the typical pageant ilk (an average-looking, bespectacled seven-year-old), she adores pageant work and had won second place in a regional contest. During dinner, the family hears a phone message from Olive's aunt, informing that them that the winner of Olive's recent pageant had to forfeit, and that Olive now has a place in the Little Miss Sunshine pageant in California. Olive is overjoyed, and after some arguing about transportation (and a pressuring pep-talk from her self-help guru father, Richard), the entire family agrees to travel to Redondo Beach in their Volkswagen micro-bus.", "Conversation in the bus reveals that Grandpa Edwin (Alan Arkin) was kicked out of his retirement home for selling and using heroin (which he still enjoys). Dwayne, Olive's brother, has been taking a vow of silence for nine months straight, and plans to keep it up until he gets into the Air Force. He spends his time reading the works of Friedrich Nietzsche and ignoring his squabbling parents and Grandpa's brazen sex advice. At a rest stop, the clutch on the micro-bus breaks, forcing the family to push-start the bus whenever it is not parked on an incline. At a gas station, Richard receives news that his book deal has fallen through. Frank is humiliated after running into his ex-lover in a convenience store. The family returns to the road, all in bad tempers, but realize (after Dwayne notices) that they have to return to the gas station for Olive, who they'd forgotten in their bad moods.", "They check into a motel for the night, Richard and Sheryl sharing a room, Frank and Dwayne in another, and Grandpa and Olive in a third. Olive confesses to Grandpa that she is scared about the pageant the following day, but is reassured by the doting Edwin that she is a beautiful person and will 'blow 'em outta the water.\" Sheryl and Richard have an explosive argument about the failed book deal, and Richard drives to Scottsdale in the middle of the night to confront Stan Grossman, his partner in the deal. Richard's ideas are rejected again, and he returns to the motel.", "Olive wakes her parents in the morning because \"Grandpa won't wake up.\" Edwin is rushed to the hospital where he is pronounced dead of an apparent heroin overdose. The family grieves, but the paperwork they are instructed to carry out will ruin their chances to get to Olive's pageant on time. Determined to honor his father's memory, Richard has the family smuggle the body into their van. Soon, however, their horn breaks and will not stop honking. They are pulled over by a state trooper who nearly uncovers Edwin's body in the trunk, but is sidetracked by Grandpa's porn collection that falls out. He lets the family go in exchange for the porn mags, and the road trip continues.", "The Hoovers are almost at the pageant site and are making good time. Olive is giving Dwayne an eye test that she got from the hospital, and Frank realizes that Dwayne is colorblind. Realizing that this wrecks his dream of becoming a test pilot (and negates his nine months of total silence), Dwayne loses it. Richard stops the bus, and Dwayne runs into a culvert in a rage insulting his family. Refusing to continue the trip and failing to be comforted by Sheryl, Olive manages to win him back on board with a silent hug.", "They arrive at the Redondo Suites hotel with much confusion about parking, and make it to the sign-up table four minutes late.

Richard finds an undertaking service to remove Edwin's body, and sadly bids farewell to his father. Dwayne and Frank, repulsed by the freakish child pageant atmosphere, walk out to a pier. Dwayne (now vocal again) expresses his frustration with being a teenager and life in general. Frank offers his nephew a piece of Proust philosophy: that it is your suffering, not your happiness, that defines you as a person.", "The pageant begins, and the prepubescent contestants, slathered disturbingly with makeup and fake tan, take the stage. Richard becomes nervous for Olive as he watches from the audience, knowing that she will not fit in. He and Dwayne, sharing the same concern, go backstage to convince Sheryl to call it off. Sheryl stands her ground, saying that they have to \"let Olive be Olive.\" The family watches nervously as Olive is led to the stage to perform.", "Dressed in a suit and top hat, Olive dedicates her dance performance to Grandpa, who had choreographed it. The rest of the family have not seen it yet. Olive's dance turns out to be a strip-burlesque routine to Rick James's \"Superfreak,\" which Olive performs with gusto, as she is innocent of its raunchy overtones. The audience is appalled and even begins to catcall, but the Hoovers stand up and cheer her on. The snippy pageant official orders the emcee to remove Olive from the stage, but Richard butts in and begins dancing next to his daughter to support her. One by one, Olive's family takes the stage and joyfully finishes the number with her. After a brief visit to the police precinct, the Hoovers are permitted to leave as long as Olive is never entered in another California beauty pageant.", "Having become closer and more confident during the trip, the Hoovers push-start the micro-bus once again and pile in.

The prison, populated primarily by hardened career criminals, is run by warden Ruth Benton, who is trying to reform the penal system by running a humanistic prison. However she is at odds with sadistic matron Evelyn Harper, who is in charge of Marie's cell block. Evelyn runs her cell block the way she wants despite Benton's directives, and takes bribes from the charge with the most money to offer. Marie's time is rough, as she slowly learns that playing by the legitimate rules will get her nowhere, especially with Harper operating by her own sadistic rules. In addition, Marie is pregnant and has little to no support outside the prison walls to support her and her expanding family. Marie ultimately changes to a more hardened inmate after a series of events including her baby being taken away from her, the suicide of a fellow model inmate following a parole denial, and Marie's own parole denial for circumstances beyond her control.

With the help of a few inmates she quickly learns the inmate pecking order and takes the advice of the kind prison Superintendent, Ruth Benton, to follow the rules and aim to get parole at the end of her first year. Her biggest obstacle is the matron in charge of her section, Evelyn Harper, an evil, sadistic overseer who goes out of her way to make everyone miserable. When her mother refuses to take care of her newborn, it goes into State care, and when Marie is refused parole, she hardens and is destined to a life of crime.", "Among the new arrivals at the Women's State Prison is nineteen-year-old Marie Allen, who has been sentenced as an accessory in a gas station robbery during which her husband was killed. Marie's physical examination reveals that she is pregnant, and so Ruth Benton, the warden, assigns her to work as a checker in the laundry. When Evelyn Harper, the matron of Marie's cell block, who exchanges favors for money, learns that Marie has no money, she reassigns her to cleaning the cells. Marie is befriended by toughened convicts Smoochie, Kitty Stark and Claire, who reveal that, like Marie, most of the women are in prison because of men. As her pregnancy advances, Marie becomes ill. Although she will still be in jail when the baby is born, Marie hopes that her mother and stepfather will care for the child until she is paroled. Kitty suggests that Marie join her shoplifting racket when she gets out, explaining that even if she is paroled, she will be forced to stay in jail until she is offered a job. Marie, however, turns the offer down. One of the convicts then has a psychotic breakdown, and when June, another convict, is denied parole, she hangs herself. After Marie goes into early labor, the volunteer doctor expresses his disgust at prison conditions, and Benton makes a proposal to the medical board that her budget be increased. Benton is aware of Harper's sadistic treatment of the women, but her efforts to have the matron fired are always stymied by Harper's political friends. Similarly, her demands for teachers and a psychologist are denied by the prison board. After Marie's mother refuses to take her baby, he is put up for adoption, and as Marie's parole hearing nears, Kitty renews her job offer. Despite Benton's favorable recommendation, Marie's parole is denied. Meanwhile, Elvira Powell, an enemy of Kitty's, is sent to prison. Her wealth easily buys Harper's favoritism, and she is made comfortable. Elvira tries to befriend Marie and recruit her for a call girl ring, but Marie remains loyal to Kitty. One day, while Kitty tries to train a convict in shoplifting techniques, a more hardened Marie demonstrates how easy it is to fool a spotter. Elvira then suggests that Harper inform Benton that Kitty is recruiting women for her shoplifting ring. Kitty is placed in solitary confinement and beaten. After Marie finds a lost kitten, Harper's efforts to remove it lead to a riot. As punishment, Benton rescinds all privileges for the woman and sentences Marie to solitary confinement. Without Benton's knowledge, Harper shaves Marie's head, and Benton again tries to have Harper removed from her position. Harper's friends see that her efforts backfire, and Benton is asked to resign. After Marie returns from the hospital, Kitty kills Harper with a fork. Determined to leave prison at any cost, Marie asks Elvira for help and obtains parole. Despite her efforts, Benton has been unable to reform her prisoners, and after Marie leaves, instructs her secretary to keep her file active, because \"she'll be back.\" Written By --- Robert D Knapp"]},

Scarlett is left to care for the weakened Melanie with no one but the house servant, Prissy (", "), to help.", "While General William Sherman's regiment bombards Atlanta with continuous cannon fire, Melanie goes into labor. Scarlett, intent on keeping her promise to Ashley, employs the help of Dr. Meade (", ") who had previously been watching Melanie's progress. However, he is unable to leave the train station where he is tending to hundreds of wounded and dying Confederate soldiers. When Prissy, who had claimed to know all there is to childbirth, admits that she knows nothing, Scarlett takes control, fueled by her anger. Though Melanie's labor is long and complicated and painful, she eventually gives birth to a son (", ") but is left severely weak.", "Scarlett sends Prissy to find the one man who can get them all safely out of Atlanta before the approaching Union troops take siege: Rhett Butler. Prissy finds him enjoying himself at a local brothel run by Belle Watling (", "). Though Rhett mocks Prissy, he agrees to assist Scarlett who insists on returning home to Tara. Rhett steals a horse and cart and fetches Scarlett, Melanie, her baby, and Prissy, taking them through Atlanta as the city burns in wake of the Union advance. They fight off some looters who try to steal their horse. Once safely outside the city, Rhett leaves them to continue to Tara alone, telling Scarlett that he's going to enlist in the Confederate army because he believes only in lost causes 'when they are really lost'. Scarlett begs him not to go and he professes his love for her, claiming to have never loved anyone else so fiercely. Scarlett rebuffs his advances but he kisses her, paying for it with a slap across the face. Rhett gives her his pistol and walks off, leaving Scarlett in tears.", "The women continue on their journey to Tara alone, traveling mostly by night to avoid enemy troops. When Melanie can no longer lactate for the baby, they resolve to milk a stray cow for sustenance. They pass the Wilkes' plantation which has befallen the same fate as many others, having burned to the ground. Melanie tries to stand but collapses upon seeing the scorched crosses marking the graves of her family. Under moonlight and just as their horse dies of exhaustion, they arrive at Tara to find it still standing but derelict, having been used as headquarters for Northern troops. The fields are untended and the grounds have been pillaged but Scarlett finds that her father, her sisters, and two of their house servants, Mammy and Pork (", "), remain, the rest of the servants/slaves having either run away or forcibly conscripted into the Union army. Scarlett discovers that her mother recently passed away from typhoid fever, leaving her already disturbed father practically insane. With barely any food, no livestock to speak of, and no money, Scarlett wanders into the fields to clear her head. She pulls a dried up carrot out of the ground to bite into it, only to vomit immediately afterwards. Resolving not to give up, she stands defiantly, saying, \"As God is my witness, I'll never be hungry again!\"", "Intermission", "Months pass and the war enters its final stages. Union General William T. Sherman marches his Northern armies through Georgia in his so-called 'March to the Sea', leaving a wide swath of destruction in his path. Scarlett and her sisters have been forced to make the best of things, performing manual labor themselves to keep Tara running and in repair. Melanie remains weakened from childbirth, spending most of her time in bed. At a moment when Scarlett is scolding her for getting out of bed again, wishing to help, a renegade Union soldier (", ") enters the home. He claims that he's simply looking for valuables to move on with but, when he threatens Scarlett, she takes the gun that Rhett gave her and shoots him in the face. The Union soldier falls dead down the staircase. Melanie is a witness, having crawled out of bed with Ashley's saber. She promises not to tell the others what happened while Scarlett searches the soldier, finding legitimate cash and other valuables. They dispose of the body and explain to Scarlett's father and sisters that her gun had accidentally discharged. Scarlett uses Melanie's nightgown to wrap the dead soldier's bloody head up and drags the body off, planning to bury it in the orchard.", "Some months later, in spring of 1865, Gerald O'Hara comes riding home with the news: the war is finally over. While her family and Melanie reflect on what they fought for, Scarlett says they'll plant more cotton, which should become profitable in the near future. Confederate soldiers amble back home in the wake of General Lee's surrender. One of them, Frank Kennedy (", "), arrives at Tara and, having long been in love with Suellen, asks Scarlett's permission to marry her, which Scarlett agrees to. Tara has become a haven for passing soldiers who are given food and rest, mostly at the behest of Melanie and much to the dismay of Scarlett, who reminds her that their supplies are already meager enough. One soldier (", "), while gives Melanie the news that Ashley is still alive but is a prisoner at a Yankee camp. Melanie justifies offering food and aid to returning soldiers, believing that Ashley is receiving similar generosity while he returns home. While Melanie, Mammy and Scarlett talk, they notice another weak-looking soldier walking toward them; Ashley. Melanie rushes to embrace him. Scarlett is tempted to do the same but is held back by Mammy; she has no rights to him. To her torment, Ashley stays at Tara with Melanie and his son (", ").", "During the first year-and-a-half of Reconstruction, high taxes are imposed on the Southern plantations by Northern carpetbaggers, much to Scarlett's dismay. Terrified that she will lose Tara, she seeks comfort from Ashley though Mammy doesn't believe anything good will come of it. Scarlett begs Ashley to run off with her to Mexico where they can start anew. He kisses her and admits that he loves her and admires her courage but simply can't leave Melanie and his son behind. Ashley reminds Scarlett that she still has Tara which she should love more than him and thrusts some of its red dirt into her hand. He tells her that the Southern civilization and its way of life with slavery is gone forever and that he intends to move to New York City with his family to work as a banker. Scarlett throws a tantrum and, when the commotion attracts Melanie's attention, she naively suggests that she and Ashley remain in Tara to help Scarlett. Dejected, Ashley gives in.", "Jonas Wilkerson (", "), former overseer of Tara, now prosperous due to collaboration with the carpetbaggers, offers to buy Tara from Scarlett. Though the tax has risen to nearly $300, Tara rejects the offer and humiliates Jonas by throwing a clump of dirt in his face. As he leaves, Scarlett's father, his mind all but completely lost, chases him down on his horse, attempting to upbraid him. However, the horse falters while attempting to jump over a fence and O'Hara is killed in the fall.", "After burying her father, Scarlett again seeks the help of the only man she knows who possesses enough wealth to help her: Rhett Butler. Despite holding a Captain's rank, Rhett is being held in the city jail in Atlanta by Union forces who are threatening to hang him unless he hands over his Confederate gold. Prior to the war, Rhett had moved all his wealth to banks in Liverpool, England where it would be safe. Conditions in the jail, which is actually a horse livery, are hardly bleak: Rhett plays cards, gambles and drinks with Union soldiers, tells them stories about his life as a blockade runner, and he even receives female visitations. Scarlett decides to dress up for the occasion and enlists Mammy to create a new dress for her out of the curtains hanging at Tara. Mammy accompanies Scarlett to Atlanta to keep her out of trouble. Posing as one of Rhett's \"sisters\", Scarlett is allowed to visit with Rhett privately at the city jail and attempts to present herself with an air of elegance, claiming that life at Tara is like paradise. Rhett, however, sees through the deception when he notices her roughened hands from working the fields. Despite her anger, she continues to beg for money and even offers to be his mistress. Rhett dismisses her and informs her that if he'd tried to use his own funds to help her, the Union would come down on him immediately. On her way out, Scarlett passes Belle Watling waiting for a visit. Noticing how well-dressed she is, Scarlett figures that she knows how to get the money.", "While walking through town, Mammy and Scarlett come across Frank Kennedy, now a successful businessman selling hardware and wood with which the city is being rebuilt. Frank claims to be saving all his money to marry Suellen and bring her to the city. Sensing an opportunity, Scarlett tells Frank that Suellen is marrying another man and presents herself open to Frank, despite Mammy's disapproving looks. Arriving back at Tara, Suellen is heartbroken and sullen, having just learned that Scarlett hastily married Frank and that he has paid off Tara's debts. She scolds Scarlett for having been married twice already and relents that she seems to be destined to become a spinster.", "Throughout that year (1866), Frank's hardware and lumber store flourishes under Scarlett's management. She refuses credit to her poor neighbors and makes lucrative deals with Northern businessmen. They expand further, buying a sawmill to expand Frank's smaller interest in the lumber industry, and Tara starts to regain part of its former splendor. Scarlett hires hungry convicts who are exploited by a cruel, former prison overseer (John Wray). Ashley expresses his discomfort at the thought of the convicts being abused, starved and used as slave labor but Scarlett is determined to allow it.", "One day, Scarlett comes across Rhett Butler, who is now free and very wealthy. He laughs, saying that she could have married him and become rich if she had waited. She brushes him off and leaves alone for the sawmill. Rhett points out that the shantytown on the way to the sawmill is full of dangerous criminals and Army deserters but Scarlett shows him that she carries the pistol he'd given her during the war.", "On the way to the sawmill, two men attack Scarlett from behind and overpower her before she can use her gun. Panicked, Scarlett faints. The men appear to be on the verge of raping her when Big Sam (Everett Brown), a former slave at Tara, saves her by beating up her attackers. News of the event spreads quickly through the town. That evening, Frank drops Scarlett and Mammy off at the Wilkes' home while he and Ashley go out to a \"political meeting.\" Later, while the women work anxiously on their sewing, Rhett appears and tells the women that the men have formed a vigilante group to punish the attackers but that the Union army has been tipped off and those at the meeting are now in danger. Melanie tells Rhett where they are meeting, considering him trustworthy despite Scarlett's advice to the contrary and Suellen's belief that he's a Yankee spy. Rhett says he will do what he can and disappears. Union captain (", ") arrives with a detachment of soldiers, demanding to know where Frank has gone to. The women stand fast for their men and Melanie convinces the captain that they don't know their husbands whereabouts. The Captain waives his intention to search the place and orders his men to surround the house and wait for anyone to return.", "Several hours later, Rhett appears back at the home with Ashley and Dr. Meade. The three men seem to be completely drunk and Rhett tells the Yankee captain, Tom, whom he knows and has a friendly rapport with, that they have just spent the evening at the bordello establishment of Belle Watling, who should confirm their story. The women, including Scarlett, are shocked and embarrassed, but the Yankee captain believes the explanation and departs after apologizing for their intrusion (after Rhett \"reminds\" Tom he is also a frequenter of Belle's bordello as well). Once the Union troops leave, Rhett and Dr. Meade drop the curtain, having just pretended to be inebriated, revealing there was a skirmish in the shantytown. Ashley is wounded, having been shot in the shoulder but the two men who attacked Scarlett are now dead, along with several others. More worried about Ashley, Scarlett neglects to inquire about her own husband, Frank. Rhett finally mentions that he was killed in the skirmish and is still there, lying dead in the road.", "Some days later, Melanie meets with Belle Watling and thanks her for helping their men stay out of trouble by backing up their false alibi. Belle says that she has a son studying up North and helped the men because of Melanie rather than Scarlett. Belle cautions Melanie about speaking to her in public from now on as it would damage Melanie's reputation but Melanie persists that she would be happy to speak to Belle anytime.", "A few days later Rhett visits the now twice-widowed Scarlett. He realizes that she has been drinking heavily despite her attempts to cover up the smell with cologne. She tells Rhett that she will never love him because she's in love with another man, but she will marry him because of his money. Rhett says that they are two of a kind; partners in crime, and he marries her anyway. Rhett and Scarlett have a luxurious honeymoon in New Orleans and return to Tara so that Scarlett can use her new riches to restore its full glory. Rhett also buys a large mansion in Atlanta where they will live on a regular basis. In time they have a child whom Rhett confidently names Bonnie Blue Butler (newborn: ", ", 2 year-old: ", ") after Melanie remarks on her brilliant blue eyes.", "After her daughter's birth, Scarlett becomes depressed over her waning youth, her increased waist size, which was once a large source of pride and her unrequited love for Ashley. She informs Rhett that she wants no more children and will no longer sleep with him. Furious, Rhett threatens her with divorce and storms out to find consolation at Belle Watling's. Although he has grounds for divorce, Rhett continues with the sham marriage in order to keep up social appearances for Bonnie's sake. Bonnie becomes a sort of substitute for Scarlett in Rhett's eyes. Over the next few years, Rhett dotes on the child, spoiling her and giving her the best of everything, including a pony and riding lessons and making sure she's accepted socially throughout Atlanta by the best classes of people.", "In 1871, India Wilkes and Mrs. Meade (", ") discover Scarlett hugging Ashley at the hardware store. Although the hug was rather innocent, Scarlett knows that rumors will fly. That night is Ashley's birthday party and Rhett, who has heard the gossip, forces Scarlett to go in a daring red taffeta dress which would be considered very inappropriate for the occasion. Melanie is the only person who welcomes Scarlett. Back at the Atlanta mansion, Scarlett finds Rhett completely drunk. They have an angry confrontation and, after he drunkenly threatens to kill her to make her forget Ashley, this time, Rhett refuses to take no for an answer. He carries Scarlett off to the bedroom. The next morning, Scarlett seems deliriously happy. When Rhett arrives to apologize and propose a divorce, her good mood vanishes. Rhett promises to take care of Scarlett financially but insists on taking Bonnie away with him. Scarlett rejects his offer, as it would be a disgrace. Rhett then leaves on an extended trip to London and still takes Bonnie with him.", "In London some months later, five-year-old Bonnie (", ") has nightmares and can't sleep in the dark. Her stuffy English nurse (", ") believes that the ordeal will build the child's character but Rhett dismisses her and lets Bonnie sleep with a candlelight on. The homesick Bonnie begs to return to her mother. When Rhett and Bonnie return to Atlanta, Scarlett tells him that she's pregnant again. Rhett reacts coldly and Scarlett ups the ante by saying she wishes the baby were not his, to which Rhett retorts, \"Maybe you'll have an accident.\" Scarlett takes a sudden blind swing at Rhett who dodges it. Scarlett falls down the stairs and loses her baby.", "Later, at the behest of Melanie who has become pregnant again, Rhett makes an effort to be kind to Scarlett. Sitting on the back terrace of their Atlanta mansion, Rhett and Scarlett discuss the possibility of Scarlett giving up the lumber business to devote herself to her husband and child. A reconciliation begins to seem possible when, at that moment, Bonnie insists stubbornly on jumping a fence with her pony after she raised the bar. Scarlett remembers her father's death and has a premonition of disaster. Her worst fears come true as the pony refuses to jump and fatally throws Bonnie over the fence. Rhett is devastated by Bonnie's death and refuses to release the child's body for burial for several days despite Scarlett's wishes. Rhett locks himself in his room with the body after shooting the pony, refusing to allow anyone in, including Scarlett who can only bang on the door screaming at him.", "Melanie arrives at the mansion and is led upstairs by Mammy, who tearfully relays the past few days events: Rhett refuses to talk to anyone and vengefully shot the pony after the accident. Mammy also mentions she thought Rhett might even shoot himself in his grief. Melanie manages to get Rhett to allow her into the room and allow undertakers to take away Bonnie's dead body. Melanie, overwrought with emotion, collapses and goes into labor. Upon a doctor's examination following the birth of a stillborn infant, he determines that Melanie is dying from internal bleeding. In a final meeting with Scarlett, Melanie asks her to look after Ashley. When Melanie dies, Ashley is left a broken man and he tells Scarlett that Melanie was always his true love, a devastating revelation to Scarlett, who then realizes that she never really loved Ashley and can only wish that he had been clearer about his own feelings for her. Rhett, witness to the scene, stalks off to his and Scarlett's home.", "Scarlett returns to the mansion seeking Rhett. Having seen Scarlett with Ashley at Melanie's house, Rhett tells her that she will never stop loving Ashley and so he is leaving her, for good, to start a new life back in his hometown of Charleston. As Rhett begins to pack his suitcase to leave, Scarlett insists that she now realizes that she loves Rhett and never truly loved Ashley but Rhett maintains that any chance of saving their marriage died with Bonnie, and that he's tolerated Scarlett's drama long enough. As he prepares to walk out the door, Scarlett begs him one last time, asking what will happen to her if he leaves. Indifferent, Rhett replies, \"Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.\" and strides out of the house into the evening fog.", "Scarlett collapses on the stairs in anguish. She pulls back from despair only when she thinks of the other great love of her life, Tara, through a series of reminiscences in voice-over . Scarlett is determined to return to Tara, make a new start, and try to somehow get Rhett back, saying to herself, \"After all, tomorrow is another day!\"", "In the final shot, we see Scarlett silhouetted against Tara as the sun sets over the hill, having arrived back at her childhood home and now facing an unknown, but new, future."]},

They recruited her because they wanted someone with tactical procedures knowledge. Outwardly, the team's mission, which works behind a Delta Force team as its primary gun power as required, is to decapitate a Mexican drug cartel by capturing or dismembering the workings of the main players, cartel head Manuel Díaz, his second in command Guillermo Díaz (Manuel's brother), and drug lord Fausto Alarcón. Kate agrees to the assignment as she feels the work of this team would be more effective in stopping the drug trade in the US than the piecemeal work of her current kidnap response unit.

When Kate and the team arrive in El Paso for their first mission, Kate learns that the team's workings are not all they appear on the surface - many of the proceedings which would not be considered above board or legal - despite the end goal being as she knows it to be. Still largely in the dark and only given information on a need to know basis, Kate decides to stick it out with the team if only to discover all that she is not told while still believing in the end goal.

There is only one way to ensure mankind's survival: Interstellar travel. A newly discovered wormhole in the far reaches of our solar system allows a team of astronauts to go where no man has gone before, a planet that may have the right environment to sustain human life.", "In the near future around the American Midwest, Cooper, an ex-science engineer and pilot, is tied to his farming land with his daughter Murph and son Tom. As devastating sandstorms ravage Earth's crops, the people of Earth realize their life here is coming to an end as food begins to run out. Eventually stumbling upon a N.A.S.A. base 6 hours from Cooper's home, he is asked to go on a daring mission with a few other scientists into a wormhole because of Cooper's scientific intellect and ability to pilot aircraft unlike the other crew members. In order to find a new home while Earth decays, Cooper must decide to either stay, or risk never seeing his children again in order to save the human race by finding another habitable planet.", "In Earth's future, a global crop blight and second Dust Bowl are slowly rendering the planet uninhabitable. Professor Brand, a brilliant N.A.S.A. physicist, is working on plans to save mankind by transporting Earth's population to a new home via a womhole. But first, Brand must send former N.A.S.A. pilot Cooper and a team of researchers through the wormhole and across the galaxy to find out which of three planets could be mankind's new home.", "A single father that flew for NASA in the past is raising a son and daughter along with his father-in-law. After NASA was cut from governmental funding due to environmental problems, he becomes a farmer. The last sustainable crop is corn and it's only a matter of time until that too becomes extinct. Mysterious clues begin emerging that he and his daughter believe are coming from a supernatural being, or aliens. What they decipher leads them to a mission where he leaves the planet and his family to save mankind.", "In the future, crop blight has caused civilization to regress into a failing agrarian society. Former NASA pilot Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) runs a farm with his family. Humanity needs more farmers to feed the world & the current scientific thinking believes that NASA Apollo missions were faked to bankrupt the Soviets (a belief that pisses Cooper off like nothing else). Murphy (Mackenzie Foy), Cooper's 10-year-old daughter, believes her room is haunted by a ghost trying to communicate with her. They discover the \"ghost\" is an unknown intelligence sending coded messages using gravitational waves, leaving binary coordinates in the dust that direct them to a secret NASA installation led by Professor John Brand (Michael Caine). Dr Brand tells Cooper that every year one crop dies & gets eliminated from the planet forever due to change in climatic conditions & severity of the dust storms. Soon, no crop will ever grow on Earth & the species will starve to death.", "Brand reveals that a wormhole, apparently created by an alien intelligence (& first discovered 48 yrs ago), leads to new planets that may offer hope for survival. NASA's \"Lazarus missions\" have identified three potentially habitable worlds orbiting the black hole Gargantua: Miller, Edmunds, and Mann, named after the astronauts who surveyed them. Originally 12 astronauts were sent to 12 different worlds. Their craft had hibernation capabilities through which the astronauts could live on for decades & wait to be rescued after transmitting habitat data back to Earth. But if the planet was assessed to be uninhabitable, there was no plan for rescue as Earth did not have the resources to again visit all 12 planets. Brand recruits Cooper to pilot the spacecraft Endurance to recover the astronauts' data from the 3 planets; if one of the planets is habitable, humanity will follow on space stations. But Brand has still not solved the problem of lifting enough of Humanity into space & to the identified planet. So plan B is to population bomb the identified planet with human embryos. The Endurance will carry 5000 human embryos, of which 10 will be incubated & once they grow up, they will be artificially inseminated so as to create a colony of 100s of humans in a few decades.\nCooper's departure devastates Murphy, and they part on bad terms.", "On Endurance, Cooper joins Brand's daughter, bio-technologist Amelia (Anne Hathaway) (& Brand's daughter); scientists Romilly (David Gyasi) and Doyle (Wes Bentley); and robots TARS and CASE. Amelia tells Cooper that Mann was the leader of the expedition that took 12 brave people to uncharted territory. Amelia has great respect for Mann.", "They enter the wormhole and head to Miller (as the meager data provided by the respective explorers puts Miller's planet as the best option), but discover the planet is so close to Gargantua that it experiences severe gravitational time dilation: each hour on the surface is seven years on Earth. A team descends to the planet, which proves inhospitable as it is covered by a shallow ocean roiled by enormous tidal waves. As Amelia attempts to recover Miller's data, a wave hits, killing Doyle and delaying the shuttle's departure. When the others return to Endurance, 23 years have passed. Murphy is now grown up & is working with Dr Brand (who is now very old) in solving the gravity equation that is the key to lifting the humanity off Earth in an attempt to recolonize another planet, as per Plan A.", "On Earth, the adult Murphy (Jessica Chastain) is now a NASA scientist assisting Brand with an equation that will enable NASA to launch the space stations via gravity. On his deathbed, Brand admits he already solved the gravity problem and determined that project is impossible as he needed more data from a black hole singularity to completely solve the equation. He concealed his findings to keep hope alive and put his faith in \"Plan B\": using frozen embryos aboard the Endurance to start humanity anew. He also knew that there was no way back to Earth via the wormhole. However, Murphy concludes that Brand's equation could work with additional data from a black hole's singularity.", "Low on fuel, Endurance can only visit one more planet before returning to Earth. After a tense vote, the team selects Mann's planet, as Mann is still transmitting. Amelia wanted to take Endurance to Edmund's planet as the data showed organic life, but Mann's data was more recent (but showed no organic life). Amelia's theory was that the 3 planets were orbiting a giant black hole & hence all accidents that happened in the universe to create life, simply did not happen in this system, so no asteroids, comets nothing. Her point was that planet showing organic life hence had more promise.", "However, they discover Mann's planet is icy and inhospitable; Mann (Matt Damon) always knew Plan B was the mission's true goal (he even tells Cooper that Brand knew that he needed a black hole's singularity data before Mann left Earth. And Singularity data is impossible as it hides behind a black hole, through which light itself cannot escape). Romily suggests that the robot TARS can enter the black hole horizon of Gargantuan fast enough & just might survive long enough to transmit data on the singularity. Mann faked data about his planet's viability so Endurance would rescue him. Mann breaks Cooper's spacesuit visor and leaves him to die, and flees to Endurance on a shuttle; Romilly is killed by a bomb Mann set to protect his secret. Amelia rescues Cooper on the other shuttle, and they arrive at Endurance in time to witness Mann docking improperly. The airlock explodes, killing Mann and causing serious damage, but Cooper uses the shuttle to get Endurance under control.", "Nearly out of fuel, Cooper and Amelia plan to slingshot Endurance around Gargantua on a course toward Edmunds. Due to being directly in the heavy gravity of Gargantua, several more decades actually pass back on Earth while TARS and Cooper detach into the black hole, sacrificing themselves to collect data on the singularity and to propel Amelia by dropping the ship's mass. They emerge in an extra-dimensional \"tesseract\", where time appears as a spatial dimension and portals show glimpses of Murphy's childhood bedroom at various times. Cooper realizes the alien beings are future humans who have constructed this space so he can communicate with Murphy and save humanity. Using gravitational waves, Cooper encodes TARS's data on the singularity into the adult Murphy's watch, allowing her to solve Brand's equation and evacuate Earth. Cooper somehow is ejected from the singularity & awakens aboard a NASA space station near Saturn and reunites with the now elderly Murphy (Ellen Burstyn), who has led humanity's exodus. Murphy convinces Cooper to search for Amelia and CASE, who have completed their one-way trip to Edmunds' planet, and are setting Plan B into motion."]},

This gives him the comfort he needs to continue to joke despite his inner torment and turmoil.", "Arthur later goes to a children's hospital to entertain them as a clown.

To top things off, Randall throws Arthur under the bus by claiming that Arthur got the gun himself. On the subway train ride home from Ha-Ha's in full clown getup, Arthur spots three drunk young Wall Street types working for Wayne Enterprises harassing a woman. Arthur starts laughing unintentionally and draws the attention of the men, while the woman wisely flees from that car. The men approach Arthur and mock him and his laughter before they start to beat him. Arthur fights back in self-defense, but they team up, and relentlessly beat him to the floor. Having had enough, Arthur then pulls out his gun and shoots two of them dead in self-defense before following the last guy out of the train and murdering him on the stairs.", "In shock over what he just did, Arthur retreats into a nearby public men's room.

However, Alfred (Douglas Hodge) comes to intervene and tell Arthur to leave. Arthur mentions his mother and her involvement with Thomas. Alfred says he remembers Penny, but that she was lying to him. Arthur attacks and nearly strangles Alfred through the bars but then notices that Bruce is watching.

Thomas also explains that Penny never told Arthur that he was adopted, which Arthur strongly rejects before uncontrollably laughing in Thomas's face.

When Carl says he can't give Arthur the info he wants, Arthur snatches the file and runs away to read it. Once away and hidden in a stairwell, Arthur opens the documents and reads them, finding that Thomas was telling the truth... according to the documents. The reality is that Penny adopted Arthur after he was found abandoned as a baby, and she abused him, tying him to a radiator and beating him alongside her abusive boyfriend. One part of the file mentions Arthur having a head injury, which is most likely what caused his laughing condition. Arthur returns to the hospital and tells Penny that he thought his life was a tragedy, but he sees it's a \"fucking comedy.\" With that, he smothers Penny to death.", "Arthur goes back home and breaks into Sophie's apartment. She sees him and is terrified, asking him to leave for the sake of her daughter. Arthur asks her if she has ever had \"a really bad day,\" to which she replies that she doesn't even know him. Through this, it is revealed that every other moment featuring Sophie was just in Arthur's head. A broken and frustrated Arthur apologizes for his intrusion and leaves Sophie alone, storming out of her apartment.", "Arthur starts to get ready for his appearance on Murray's show and paints his face white. He is visited in his apartment by Randall and another former co-worker, a dwarf named Gary (Leigh Gill). They offer condolences after they hear about Penny's death, but then Randall begins mentioning Burke and Garrity going to their apartments to question them about the subway murders. Arthur realizes that Randall is only seeking a way to use Arthur in order to cover his own butt and then snaps, brutally stabbing Randall twice in the face before smashing his head against the wall. A terrified Gary questions Arthur's deeds and begs to be let go. Arthur agrees to before playfully scaring him as a prank. Gary tries to undo the lock on Arthur's door but is unable to due to his height. He asks Arthur to open the door for him to which Arthur immediately agrees, pausing once to thank Gary for being the only person in his life who was nice to him. Arthur kisses Gary on the forehead and lets him go.", "Arthur then dyes his hair green, puts on full clown make-up, and dons a burgundy suit. He then dances down the stairways, fully embracing his insanity and carefree life. Burke and Garrity find Arthur dancing in the street and move in to arrest him. Arthur runs, and they chase him into the subway train where dozens of other Gotham citizens are dressed like clowns after being inspired by the murders. Arthur hides his face with a clown mask, which he steals from a protester and inadvertently starts a brawl in the train cars. As the detectives pursue Arthur, one clown gets in the way, and Burke accidentally shoots him dead when they struggle with his gun. The clowns pull the detectives out of the subway and start beating them relentlessly, allowing Arthur to get away, moving smoothly through the police forces which swarm the area.", "At the TV station, Arthur meets Murray and his agent Gene (Marc Maron). Before he goes on, Arthur asks Murray to introduce him as \"Joker,\" since Murray referred to him as such when playing his clip. Murray asks Arthur if his clown make-up has political agendas behind it to which Arthur replies, \"I don't believe in that. I don't believe in anything.\" While waiting to be introduced, Arthur sees Murray broadcasting a clip of a struggling Arthur trying to tell a joke. This causes Arthur's mind and plans to change, and then he dances out into the spotlight.", "Arthur goes out as the show begins. He awkwardly tells Murray a joke, which he finds funny for its dark humor though nobody else does. After being confronted with this, Arthur continues by admitting to the subway murders. Murray and the audience slowly realize that Arthur is serious. Arthur argues that the audience only cares for the victims because Thomas Wayne spoke for them, but anyone else like Arthur would be ignored and walked over. Murray and the audience grow angrier with Arthur, but so does he. Murray scolds Arthur, which escalates into Arthur snapping and telling another joke, grinning giddily. \"What do you get when you cross a mentally ill loner with a society that abandons him and treats him like trash?!\" he asks, only for Murray to try shutting him off before calling for the police. An enraged Arthur then screams, \"You get what you fucking' deserve!\" before blowing Murray's brains out in front of everyone. The audience runs away in terror, and the news of the murder immediately hits the airwaves. Arthur then laughs genuinely for the first time in his life.", "Gotham is now overrun by rioting citizens dressed as clowns after hearing about what Arthur did. The Waynes leave a movie theater to find the chaos in the streets. Thomas takes his wife Martha (Carrie Louise Putrello) and Bruce into an alley, but one clown follows them and tells Thomas he is getting what he deserves using the punchline that Arthur used on the Murray Franklin show. With that, he shoots Thomas and Martha dead in front of Bruce.", "Meanwhile, Arthur has been arrested and is being taken by the police. Arthur looks out the window and laughs gleefully as he sees the destruction and chaos he has caused. Just then, the clowns in an ambulance run into the car, killing the cops and freeing Arthur, who is injured and unconscious. When he awakes, Arthur finds himself surrounded by a mob of cheering mobsters in clown masks. The rioters then cheer Arthur on as he stands on a car and embraces their admiration, now that he has gotten the recognition he has long desired. He dances to their cheering and then pauses, finding that his nose is bleeding profusely. He then spreads the blood across his upper lip and grins before standing before them, elevated like a god.", "Sometime later, Arthur is locked up in Arkham Asylum. He laughs after telling this story and visualizes a young Bruce standing over his parents in the alley. Realizing that he has, in a way, turned Bruce into himself, Arthur laughs some more, finding this genuinely hilarious. He meets a new social worker (April Grace) and says he wants to tell her a joke, but she wouldn't get it. A few minutes later, Arthur then steps out of the room, leaving a trail of bloody footprints behind before he is chased around by orderlies."]},

Harold is so shy around girls, that he can't speak to them without stuttering. Regardless, Harold has written a yet unpublished manuscript, it being what he mistakenly believes is the definitive guide on how to attract different types of women, each situation which he passes off as actually being his own experience, which may be only true in his fantasies. On his way to the office of publisher Roger Thornsby, Harold meets the wealthy Mary Buckingham. Because of the situation, Harold is able to speak to her without stuttering. The two end up falling in love with each other, although their feelings are initially unknown to the other. While Harold continually dreams of Mary, Mary continually drives through Little Bend in hopes of running into Harold, despite or largely because she is pursued by Ronald DeVore, to whose marriage proposals she has always said no. When Harold learns unofficially that his manuscript has been declined by Thornsby, Mary decides to marry Ronald if only because Harold now feigns disinterest in her, unknowingly to her if only because he feels he is not in her league due to the manuscript not being published. But when new information comes to light on the day of the wedding, Harold does whatever he can to stop Mary from marrying Ronald, while getting the girl for himself."]},
