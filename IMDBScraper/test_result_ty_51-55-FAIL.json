The relationship between mother and son is difficult from the very first years. When Kevin is 15, he does something irrational and unforgivable in the eyes of the entire community. Eva grapples with her own feelings of grief and responsibility. Did she ever love her son? And how much of what Kevin did was her fault?", "Eva (Swinton) gives up her beloved freedom and bohemian lifestyle to have a child with her husband, Franklin (Reilly). Pregnancy does not seem to agree with Eva, but what's worse, when she does give birth to a baby boy named Kevin (later played by Miller), she can't seem to bond with him. When Kevin grows from a fussy, demanding toddler into a sociopathic teen, Eva is forced to deal with the aftermath of her son's horrific act.", "The beginning of the film is interspersed with flashbacks of Eva during her pregnancy with Kevin, the family before Kevin committed the shooting, and the shooting itself.", "Eva Khatchadourian was once a successful travel writer who now lives alone in a remote town, haunted by a traumatic memory from her past. One morning, she wakes up to find that her house and car have been covered in red paint. She attempts to clean the windshield of her car before getting in and driving off. As she drives through her neighborhood, several passersby regard her with scorn.", "Eva applies for a job at a travel agency. The hiring manager tells her that she doesn't care about Eva's qualifications, but she can have the job as long as she knows how to type and file. Eva accepts the job and leaves the agency smiling. She is approached by two other women, one of whom cynically comments on Eva's happy expression, slaps her, and shouts profanities at her before walking away. A passerby rushes up to check on Eva and offers to call the police, but she hastily dismisses his concerns.", "Eva's boss tells her that she needs a stack of papers processed by the afternoon, but Eva reminds her that she's taking the afternoon off. She later goes to a prison center where she is greeted by one of the security guards, Al. She sits down to visit her son, Kevin. The two sit in silence as Kevin bites his nails, and lines up the discarded fingernails in a row along the table. As Eva is leaving, officers subdue another prisoner, who screams at them to leave him alone, swearing his innocence, and begs Eva for help; at the behest of Al, she ignores them.", "The film then cuts to a flashback sequence of Eva giving birth to Kevin; the nurse tells her to \"stop resisting\" as she screams in pain. Once the newborn Kevin is delivered, her husband Franklin holds him and looks at him affectionately as Eva merely sits and stares at the wall. Some time later, she is bouncing a baby Kevin and smiling at him while the baby continues to wail, visibly frustrating her. Franklin wakes Eva up from a nap and goes to pick up baby Kevin despite Eva begging him not to; much to her shock, Kevin does not cry or fuss when being held by Franklin.", "Back in the present, Eva is at a grocery store. She places a carton of eggs in her cart before seeing a woman she recognizes and hiding behind a nearby shelf. After she goes unnoticed, she returns to shopping. When paying for her items, the cashier opens the carton and sees that all twelve eggs have been broken. Eva sees the same woman glaring at her and says she'll purchase the eggs anyway despite the cashier's protests. Through another flashback, it is revealed that the woman from the grocery store is the mother of one of Kevin's victims.", "Another flashback scene shows Eva playing with a young Kevin. She encourages him to speak, but Kevin sits in silence. When she rolls him a red ball and asks him to roll it back, he ignores her. She later takes him to a doctor to have his ears checked, assuming that his incessant screaming as an infant may have damaged his hearing, but the doctor assures her that Kevin's hearing is fine. She mentions that reluctance to speak is indicative of autism, but the doctor denies this as well, claiming Kevin doesn't exhibit any other autistic traits. Later, when she rolls a ball to him again, he complies in rolling it back, much to her delight. Her attempts at getting him to speak, however, continually fail; he flat-out refuses to call her \"mommy,\" telling her \"no\" instead.", "Back in the present, it is Halloween, and a group of rowdy kids in costume bang on Eva's door and windows, demanding candy while she turns all her lights off and hides in a corner. They manage to throw rotten food at her fridge through a window that has been left open. This is interspersed with a flashback scene of Eva directly telling Kevin she resents him while Franklin watches in disappointment. Later, the family goes house-hunting upon Franklin's insistence that Kevin needs more space to move around, despite Eva claiming she doesn't want to leave New York. In the present, Eva, while on her lunch break, is greeted by a young man in a wheelchair named Soweto. Soweto tells her his doctors have told him that he has a chance of regaining his ability to walk, and tells to her take care of herself before leaving. It is then revealed that Soweto was another one of Kevin's victims - though he survived the shooting, his injuries made him permanently lose use of his legs.", "Another flashback reveals young Kevin walking in on Eva performing fellatio on Franklin before telling him that he defecated in his bed. Franklin gets out of bed to help him, while Eva pretends to go to sleep. Later, Eva has covered her bedroom wall in maps. Kevin enters the room and tells her the maps look \"dumb.\" Eva says she decorated the room to match her personality, and offers to do the same for him; he only says, \"What personality?\" Later, she discovers that Kevin has used a squirt gun to cover her bedroom walls in paint. In a fit of rage, she destroys the gun by stomping on it repeatedly. Kevin watches her with a satisfied smile on his face. Franklin scolds him that night, then tells Eva that Kevin feel remorse for his actions, and was only trying to help make the room special.", "Back in the present, Eva motions to a scar on Kevin's arm and asks if he remembers how he acquired it. He responds that it was the most honest thing she ever did. In another flashback, Eva tries to teach Kevin how to count, but he rebukes her by counting all the way up to fifty. Frustrated, she writes a math problem on a piece of paper and asks him to solve it, but he crumples the paper into a ball and tosses it against the wall. He proceeds to defecate in his diaper, further angering her as he smiles sarcastically. She changes him, only for him to immediately defecate in the fresh one. Blinded by rage, she throws Kevin against the wall, inadvertently breaking his arm. While driving him home from the hospital, she apologizes to Kevin. When Franklin notices Kevin's arm in a sling and asks what happened, Kevin explains that he had fallen off his changing table while Eva went to retrieve fresh wipes to change his diaper. Eva tries to accept responsibility for the incident but Franklin comforts her, saying she can't watch Kevin every second of every day. As the couple sits on the couch that night, they hear the flushing of the toilet upstairs; Franklin is thrilled, saying whatever methods Eva used to potty train Kevin must have been effective. She goes into Kevin's room that night and tells him she loves him, but he resists. Kevin uses the incident to manipulate Eva into doing things he wants, threatening to tell Franklin the truth if she does not comply.", "One morning, Kevin comments on Eva's weight gain. Franklin realizes that she is pregnant and scolds her for not having told him earlier. Eva later tries to explain the concept of pregnancy to Kevin; he shocks her by asking if she's referring to \"fucking\" and revealing that he already knows how sexual intercourse works. She tells him that even if he doesn't enjoy having a new baby brother or sister, he's going to have to get used to it. A few months later, Eva and Franklin's daughter, Celia, is born. When Kevin visits her at the hospital, he flicks water in her face. Franklin leaves with him to go to the cafeteria as Eva tries to comfort the crying baby girl.", "Eva tries to confront Franklin regarding her concerns with Kevin's behavior, though Franklin makes up excuses for him. Later, a sick Kevin vomits on the floor; Eva cleans up the stain, comforting him when he apologizes. That night, she reads him a chapter from Robin Hood as he lies in bed. He cuddles up to her and doesn't resist when she strokes his hair or kisses his forehead; it is the first time he has ever shown her any form of affection. Back in the present, Eva is visited in her home by two Christian missionaries. They ask her if she knows where she'll be spending the afterlife. She tells them she is going straight to Hell before closing the door. Another flashback reveals that Franklin has bought Kevin a toy archery set. Later, as he grows into a teenager, this becomes a real archery set, and Kevin has proven to be a very skilled archer. In the present, Eva awakens from a nap to find that Kevin is on TV, talking about how shallow people's lust for entertainment has become and claiming that he wouldn't have attracted national attention if he was just an average student.", "More flashbacks illustrate the teenage Kevin's relationship with Celia, and his consistent mistreatment of her - he ties her up and gags her with tinsel, attacks her with a vacuum cleaner, verbally berates her, and rejects all forms of affection from her. In one instance, Eva accidentally enters Kevin's room while he is masturbating, but he doesn't seem bothered; instead, he maintains eye contact with her as he continues. In the present, Eva attends a Christmas party at her office. She is invited by her coworker, Colin, to dance, but when she rejects him, he insults her, and she leaves. In another flashback, Eva and Celia see Kevin standing outside of a bookstore, where he stares at a poster of his mother's newly released book. Upon being noticed by them, he disappears. When Eva asks him about it later that evening, Kevin denies having been there. She then invites him to do something together \"for fun\" that Friday evening, which he agrees to, surprisingly enough. They play miniature golf together that Friday; when Eva makes comments on the obesity of several other players, Kevin tells her she has a tendency to be \"harsh,\" and when she calls him out on his hypocrisy, he agrees with her, telling her, \"wonder where I got it from.\"", "Eva takes Kevin out to dinner that same night. When she attempts to make small talk with him, he responds snidely and comments on her shallow attempts at bonding with him. Later, she snoops in his room and finds a CD marked \"I love you.\" in Sharpie. Curious, she inserts it into her computer, only for it to become infected with a virus. She confronts him and asks why he has it; he simply answers that he \"collects them\" and that there is no real point to him owning the CDs. For Christmas, Franklin gifts Kevin a series seven bow, supposedly the \"best one in the store\" as promised by the merchant. Some time later, Celia's pet guinea pig, Snuffles, goes missing. Franklin and Eva spend the whole night looking for him, to no avail. Eva explains to Celia that Snuffles has gone to live in the garden, though secretly she suspects Kevin is behind it. She then uses a caustic drain cleaner to clear a blockage in a sink.", "The scene cuts to Franklin and Eva sitting in a hospital waiting room. Franklin asks Eva why she left the cleaner out, but Eva promises that she didn't. She then says Kevin was the one responsible for the incident, but Franklin angrily dismisses her. In the present, Eva waits in the visitor's room at the incarceration center to visit Kevin. Another woman sits down next to her. When the woman begins crying, Eva holds her hand to comfort her, which the woman responds to. Another flashback shows the family, minus Celia, sharing dinner. Eva thanks Kevin for calling an ambulance, but snidely implies that he may have been responsible for the incident since he was supposed to be taking care of Celia. Franklin assures Kevin that they don't want him to blame himself for the incident. It is then revealed that Celia has been blinded in one eye by the cleaning fluid and is going to need to wear a glass one in its place. Franklin says he would appreciate Kevin defending Celia against any bullying her glass eye may warrant, but Kevin says Celia simply needs to learn to cope with it on her own. Another scene shows Eva cleaning Celia's wound, revealing a bandage completely covering her right eye. Later, as Celia and her parents watch TV, Kevin invites her to watch him practice his archery, but Eva forbids it.", "Later, Eva and Franklin discuss plans to divorce. When Franklin jokes that custody is a \"no-brainer,\" Eva asks him if he's already decided; Franklin says there was \"nothing left to decide; it already happened.\" Kevin clears his throat nearby, revealing that he has been listening in on their conversation. Franklin quickly tries to backpedal, saying Kevin likely misunderstood due to hearing the conversation out of context; Kevin replies that he is the context. A few days later, Kevin receives a package in the mail full of bicycle locks. When Eva asks him what they are for, he responds that he bought them for cheap online and plans to make money by selling them to other students at school. Eva and Franklin touch each other affectionately as they lay in bed that night.", "The next morning, Franklin lovingly plays with Celia as Kevin eats breakfast. Eva says Kevin's forehead feels clammy and asks him if he's feeling alright, but Kevin assures her he's never felt better. She mentions that his sixteenth birthday is approaching and asks if they should do something to commemorate it, but he responds that he may be busy. Later, while at work, Eva leaves a voicemail to Franklin, telling him she loves him and that she wants their marriage to work, offering to discuss it later when the kids aren't home. One of Eva's officemates enters and reveals that something has happened at Gladstone High, the school Kevin attends. Once she arrives, she discovers that a school shooting has occurred, and that Kevin was the perpetrator; he used the bicycle locks to trap several other students in the school's gymnasium, where he murdered them with his bow and arrow. Eva watches in horror as Kevin is arrested by police, while Kevin looks at her with a satisfied smile on his face.", "Eva returns home to a silent, empty house. She finds a door open and discovers Franklin and Celia's bloodied bodies on the grass, both having been killed by Kevin with his bow before he went to the school. Back in the present, Eva is visiting Kevin in prison again. She tells him he doesn't look happy, to which he responds he has never. It is revealed that Kevin is soon to turn eighteen and will be transferred to an adult prison, and that it's the two year anniversary of when he committed the massacre. Eva pleads with him to tell her why he did it. He responds, \"I used to think I knew, now I'm not so sure.\" The guard tells them their time is up. Eva hugs Kevin; he does not reciprocate the hug, but does not reject it. The final shot of the movie is Eva walking down the prison hallway."]},

Dr. Malcolm Sayer is hired as a clinical physician at a local hospital in the Bronx, despite only having a research background. The job is not ideal on his side as he has difficulties relating to people which is the reason he has focused on research projects not involving human subjects, while the hospital hires him somewhat out of desperation in not finding anyone else with the qualifications who wants the job. Most of his patients are in a semi-catatonic state and are housed no in what some of the orderlies coin the \"garden\" ward, where all they can do for the patients is water and feed them. He notices that some of the patients, despite their generally catatonic state, respond in unusual ways to certain stimuli. In doing some research, he also finds that some common bonds between these patients are that they suffered from encephalitis in the 1920s or 1930s, and that their physical states are like they have Parkinson's disease frozen in time. As such, he is able to convince, albeit reluctantly, his skeptical boss, Dr. Kaufman, to administer an expensive experimental drug therapy on only one patient with family consent. That patient is forty-one year old Leonard Lowe, who has been in his current state since he was eleven years old, and who has been supported by his loving mother through all these years. As the drug therapy \"awakens\" Leonard, there are several issues that come into play. Malcolm has to try and convince Kaufman and the hospital administration to extend the therapy to the other patients. Despite not knowing the long term effects, Leonard, who was aware of his surroundings through his catatonic state, may have mixed emotions about his situation, wanting both to be treated as human being and an experiment guinea pig to ensure that what is happening benefits him and others in the long run. Mrs. Lowe may be unprepared for the new Leonard, she expecting who she remembers as a sweet eleven year old boy. Through all these issues, what may be the most illuminating issue for Malcolm is the need to stimulate the human spirit, including his own in dealing with people around him.", "A new doctor finds himself with a ward full of catatonic patients. He is disturbed by them and the fact that they have been catatonic for decades with no hope of any cure. When he finds a possible chemical cure he gets permission to try it on one of them. When the first patient awakes, he is now well into his 50s having gone into a catatonic state at 20 years of age. The film then delights in the new awareness of the patients and then on the reactions of their relatives to the changes in the newly awakened.", "In 1969, Dr. Malcolm Sayer (Robin Williams) is a dedicated and caring physician at a local hospital in the New York City borough of The Bronx. After working extensively with the catatonic patients who survived the 1917-1928 epidemic of Encephalitis Lethargica, Sayer discovers certain stimuli will reach beyond the patients' respective catatonic states; actions such as catching a ball thrown at them, hearing familiar music, and experiencing human touch all have unique effects on particular patients and offer a glimpse into their worlds. Leonard Lowe (Robert De Niro) proves elusive in this regard, but Sayer soon discovers that Leonard is able to communicate with him by using a Ouija board.", "After attending a lecture at a conference on the subject of the L-Dopa drug and its success with patients suffering from Parkinson's Disease, Sayer believes the drug may offer a breakthrough for his own group of patients. A trial run with Leonard Lowe yields astounding results as Leonard completely \"awakens\" from his catatonic state; this success inspires Sayer to ask for funding from donors so that all the catatonic patients can receive the L-Dopa medication and experience \"awakenings\" back to reality.", "Meanwhile, Leonard is adjusting to his new life and becomes romantically interested in Paula (Penelope Ann Miller), the daughter of another hospital patient and begins spending time with her when she comes to the hospital to visit her father. Leonard also begins to chafe at the restrictions placed upon him as a patient of the hospital, desiring the freedom to come and go as he pleases and stirs up a bit of a revolt in the process of arguing his case repeatedly to Sayer and the hospital administration. Sayer notices that as Leonard grows more agitated battling administrators and staff about his perceived confinement, a number of facial and body tics are starting to manifest, and Leonard has difficulty controlling them.", "While Sayer and the hospital staff continue to delight in the success of L-Dopa with this group of patients, they soon find that it is a temporary measure. As the first to \"awaken\", Leonard is also the first to demonstrate the limited duration of this period of \"awakening\". Leonard's tics grow more and more prominent, and he starts to shuffle more as he walks, and all of the patients are forced to witness what will eventually happen to them. He soon begins to suffer full body spasms and can hardly move. Leonard, however, puts up well with the pain, and asks Sayer to film him, in hopes that he would someday contribute to research that may eventually help others. Leonard acknowledges sadly what is happening to him and has a last lunch with Paula where he tells her he cannot see her anymore. Leonard and Dr. Sayer reconcile their differences, but Leonard returns to his catatonic state soon after. The other patients' fears are similarly realized as each eventually returns to catatonia no matter how much their L-Dopa dosages are increased.", "Sayer tells a group of grant donors to the hospital that although the \"awakening\" did not last, another kind one of learning to appreciate and live life took place. The film ends with Sayer standing over the once again-catatonic Leonard behind a Ouija board, with his hands on Leonard's hands which man the Planchette. \"Let's begin.\" Sayer says."]},

She viciously insults him and his parents, angering Harry who unwittingly uses his innate magical powers to cause her to inflate, and float off, out of the Dursleys' house and into the twilight. Harry flees the Dursleys' home, furious. At first he walks with determination but soon grinds to a stop as he realizes he hasn't anywhere to go. He sits down at the edge of the road with his trunk. His surroundings stir as the wind picks up and a street lamp flickers above him. A jet black dog emerges from the bushes opposite, growling at him and he raises his wand. At that instant however, the eccentric Knight Bus, for lost witches or wizards, makes a sharp appearance and escorts Harry on a wacky journey to the wizards' pub 'The Leaky Cauldron.' While there, Harry learns that Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), an alleged supporter of Lord Voldemort, the dark wizard, has escaped from Azkaban prison. Harry must meet the Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge (Robert Hardy) and he fears expulsion from Hogwarts for his using of under-age magic out of school. However, the matter is surprisingly dropped as \"...the Ministry doesn't send students to Azkaban for blowing up their aunts.\" While at The Leaky Cauldron Harry also reconvenes with his two best friends, Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), and the rest of the Weasley family. Mr. Arthur Weasley (Mark Williams) pulls Harry to one side to warn him about Sirius Black. He suggests that Harry needs to be cautious of Sirius Black due to his allegiance with Voldemort. He believes that Harry is the only thing which stands in the way of Voldemort returning to power and that it is on this premise that Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban. To find and kill Harry Potter.", "Harry, Ron and Hermione board the train to Hogwarts, discovering in their compartment the sleeping Professor Remus Lupin (David Thewlis) who is to be the new 'Defence Against the Dark Arts' teacher. Harry airs his concerns about Black's escape and his possible objective to Ron and Hermione. Tension builds during their discussion however as the train is stopped on a bridge and the lights pop out in each cabin. Ron peers out of the window, concerned that \"...there is something out there.\" The train is violently jolted and a great cold descends around them, ice creeping over the windows. In the corridor outside, a scary dark creature slowly appears, floating towards them. It opens the door to their cabin and begins to engage frighteningly with Harry, sucking at his whole body. The sleeping teacher suddenly wakes, stands up, and repels the creature with a very bright white light emanating from his wand. Harry faints. On his coming round Lupin gives him chocolate to eat and explains that the creature is a 'Dementor' which drains happiness from anything it approaches. The Dementors ordinarily guard the wizard prison, 'The Prison of Azkaban' but are out searching for the escapee Black, and entered the train looking for him. Harry heard a woman screaming during the ordeal, but no one else heard it.", "As Harry begins his third year at Hogwarts we learn of some significant changes. Alongside the official announcement of the formerly encountered, new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, Professor Lupin. Rubeus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane), the groundsman, becomes additionally a professor of 'Care of Magical Creatures.' Also, Hermione seems to be taking nearly twice as many classes as everyone else, including some which are taught simultaneously.", "During a Divination class, Professor Trelawney (Emma Thompson) foresees Harry's death in the tealeaves of his cup, which form the shape of a 'Grim' or large dog. In tealeaf reading this symbolises death. In Hagrid's first class, Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) deliberately provokes Buckbeak, a Hippogriff, into attacking and injuring him. Draco's father, Lucius Malfoy, a powerful Ministry of Magic member of staff, files an official complaint. In Defence Against the Dark Arts, Professor Lupin instructs the class in the defeat of a Boggart, which changes its form to appear as one's greatest fear. When Harry steps up, it manifests itself as a Dementor, however Lupin steps in to defeat it before Harry gets the chance.", "Harry is told he can't go on the school outings to Hogsmeade, a local village inhabited solely by magical beings, as he hasn't got his admission slip signed, and watches his friends go without him. Instead, he meets with Lupin, and Harry discovers that the reason he wasn't allowed to fight the Boggart was that Lupin had been worried it would take the shape of Voldemort. This concern catches Harry by surprise, because Harry had been thinking even more fearfully about the Dementors. Later that night, Sirius Black breaks into Hogwarts and destroys the Fat Lady's (Dawn French) portrait that guards Gryffindor Tower. The students spend the night sleeping in the Great Hall while the teachers search the castle for Black. Because Black is believed at large in the castle Dementors are sent specifically to patrol the perimeter of Hogwarts. Next day, Professor Snape (Alan Rickman) replaces Lupin as Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher while Lupin is intriguingly \"...incapable of teaching at the present time.\" In an odd divergence from routine, he teaches the class about Werewolves.", "During the next school Quidditch match, a popular wizard sport, several Dementors approach and try to engage their powers over Harry, causing him to faint and fall off his broomstick. Dumbledore (Michael Gabon) breaks Harry's fall, but his broomstick flies off into the magical tree, the 'Whomping Willow' and is destroyed. Dumbledore is angry that the Dementors came within school grounds as they are prohibited from doing so. Harry wonders why the Dementors seem to have a special interest in him and Lupin reveals that this is due to the horrors within Harry's past. Harry considers that he needs to know how to defend himself against them and convinces Lupin as such, who agrees to teach him.", "At the time of the next school outing, still keen to go to Hogsmeade, Harry attempts to sneak into the village under his Invisibility Cloak, but is caught by Fred and George Weasley (James and Oliver Phelps), who give him the Marauder's Map. It is a map of the entire school and shows the real-time locations of everyone on the grounds. Fred and George also tell Harry that the map shows the whereabouts of several secret passages out of Hogwarts, ideal for leaving undetected. Once in Hogsmeade village, and back under his Invisibility Cloak, Harry catches sight of the Minister Fudge and Professor Minerva McGonagall (Maggie Smith) chatting in the street, discussing Black and himself. He follows them as they go inside and is shocked to overhear that Sirius Black was his parents' best friend and is still his godfather and a legal guardian. Black supposedly divulged the Potter's secret whereabouts to Lord Voldemort and murdered their friend Peter Pettigrew, as well as twelve Muggle bystanders (non-magic humans). Harry vows to kill Black. On returning from the outing we find out from Hagrid that as a consequence of Lucuis Malfoy's complaint, Buckbeak has been sentenced to death. That same night, after hours, Harry is astonished when he sees the aforementioned Peter Pettigrew's name on the Marauder's Map. He goes looking for him but can't find him. After Professor Snape discovers Harry out of bed, the map is confiscated by Lupin who meets them, and, covering for Harry, tells Snape it is merely a joke parchment and of no significance.", "Harry has the agreed private class with Lupin, in which he must generate a Patronus, a shield that is used to repel the Dementors. Lupin has him test himself out on a Boggart. He fails the first time, but conjures one on his second attempt. Later on, returning to a recently finished Divinations class to bring back a crystal ball knocked over by Hermione, Harry reencounters Professor Trelawney. She grabs Harry by the shoulder, speaks as though possessed, and predicts that \"...the Dark Lord's servant will return to him that night and that innocent blood shall be spilled.\"", "When Harry, Ron and Hermione learn that Buckbeak is to be executed, they visit Hagrid in his hut to console him. On the way Draco taunts them about it and Hermione punches him in the face. While there, Hagrid says they cannot remain with him during the execution and that Buckbeak can't be set free, since the officials would know it was Hagrid. Hagrid has also found Ron's lost rat Scabbers, and returns him to Ron. Ron had wrongly believed that his rat had been eaten by Hermione's cat. As the execution party approaches the hut, stones fly in through the window and they leave and run back to the edge of the castle, watching the execution from afar. Scabbers then bites Ron, who chases after him, finally collecting him under the Whomping Willow. The black dog makes another appearance and attacks Ron and drags him, along with Scabbers, into a hole at the tree's base. Harry and Hermione follow, finding a tunnel which leads them to the Shrieking Shack.", "Inside, in a fast moving scene, Harry finally confronts Sirius Black who he has been led to believe wishes to kill him, and whom he wishes to kill. We discover that as an illegal Animagus, Black can transform into animal at will, thus he is also the infamous black dog. Professor Lupin, who had spotted the group on the confiscated Marauder's Map, suddenly bursts in and embraces his old friend Black. Confronted by Hermione, Lupin admits to being a werewolf. Lupin and Black then explain that Black is not the one who betrayed the Potters, rather it was Peter Pettigrew (Timothy Spall), who has been hiding for twelve years in his Animagus form as Scabbers, Ron's rat. He is Voldemort's servant, not Black, and he framed Black for his crimes. Meanwhile Snape bursts in also confronting Black but is disposed of by Harry. Harry is skeptical of the story until Black and Lupin force Pettigrew back into his human form, and after some squealing resistance Pettigrew finally confesses that it is true, proving Black's innocence. Black further clears up the misunderstanding by explaining, that on discovering Pettigrew was still alive, he escaped Azkaban in order to kill him. As Lupin and Black are about to kill Pettigrew, Harry stops them, and showing Pettigrew mercy, tells him they will take him back to the castle, where he can be left for the Dementors.", "As the group heads back to the castle, Harry and Sirius pause and chat optimistically. Harry remarks that Pettigrew would have been of no use dead. Firstly he didn't want his father's two best friends to be killers, and secondly he is the key in proving Sirius's innocence. Sirius suggests Harry comes to live with him. They are disturbed however, when, as the full moon rises, it causes Lupin to turn into the dangerous werewolf since he had neglected to take his potion which inhibits this transformation. Black responds by transforming again into the black dog in order to protect Harry, Ron and Hermione. The werewolf and Black have a vicious fight. During the ensuing commotion, Pettigrew transforms himself back into the rat and escapes, not pursued. Harry runs forward in his angst at Sirius's torture at the hands of the werewolf, inadvertently attracting its attention. However while approaching Harry, it is distracted by some other distant werewolf cry. Meanwhile, Sirius, badly injured, has moved down to the nearby lake where he lies at the edge. Harry follows and kneels over him. As he does so, a swarm of Dementors approaches them. Harry produces a Patronus to try and fend them off, however it is not nearly strong enough and they both begin to submit to the Dementors. Then on the other side of the river appears the brilliant white symbol of a stag and an immense Patronus which drives the Dementors away. Harry faints.", "Harry awakens in the hospital wing to hear the news, that Sirius Black has been captured and is about to be given the Dementor's Kiss, to suck out his soul. Dumbledore enters and Harry, Ron and Hermione try and convince him of Black's innocence. Dumbledore somehow already knows, but says that their word alone won't be believed. However, he suggests mysteriously, that Harry and Hermione travel in time back by using Hermione's time-turning device (we now find out how she has been attending simultaneous classes), and at least save both Black and Buckbeak from their fates. Hermione turns her hour-glass necklace back three turns (three hours), and Harry and Hermione are together thrust into the past, where they observe and remould the evenings events. They throw stones through the window of Hagrid's hut, alerting themselves of the approaching execution party. They rescue Buckbeak while the execution party is inside with Hagrid shortly before the execution, thus absolving Hagrid of any blame. Hermione diverts the attention of the werewolf Lupin stalking the past Harry with an imitation of another werewolf's cry. And, from a hiding place in the forest, Harry watches the Dementor sequence and realizes, as the stag symbol fails to appear, that he must have been the one who conjured the powerful Patronus. After saving his past self and Black from the Dementors, Harry and Hermione fly on Buckbeak's back to the tower, where Black is imprisoned, and rescue him. Harry and Black share a moment of contemplation, as since Black is going to be back on the run, still wanted and without proof of his innocence, their relationship will now be sadly fraught with complications and Harry's dream of living with his godfather is shattered. However, Harry takes comfort in knowing that Black, although still considered a fugitive, is at least free and safe for the time being. Black and Buckbeak leave, Black riding on his back. Harry and Hermione make it back to the hospital wing just as the timeline restores itself, and a reticent Dumbledore merrily bids them goodnight.", "As the school year end approaches, Lupin announces that he is resigning, believing that parents of the students would not be comfortable in the now open knowledge that he is a werewolf. He returns the Marauder's Map to Harry since he is no longer a professor. Harry later receives a gift from an unknown source, a Firebolt, an extremely fast racing broom. Hermione holds up a large feather, also contained within the parcel, confirming that Sirius must have sent it. Harry tries it out and is whisked away from sight, ending the film with the snapshot image of Harry flying his new broom, ecstatic."]},

And while Bill's mother Grace was ill-prepared emotionally to be without Clive, she had to grow up quickly to deal with leading the family through the changing times.

Adding to the confusion is the fact that Perrin is having an affair with Paulette Lefebvre (Colette Castel), the wife of his best friend Maurice (both of whom are musicians in the same orchestra as Perrin), and Maurice, upon accidentally hearing a recording of Perrin and Paulette having torrid sex (made by Milan's agents and listened to inside a floral delivery truck), jumps to the mistaken conclusion that Paulette is having an affair with a florist.

Sooner or later, York will have to come face-to-face with his greatest fear: to kill or be killed.

York is pretty well convinced now that living in accord with the words of the Bible is well substantiated.", "Finally, Alvin goes to see Gracie and apologize for coming between her and Zeb, the way that he did.

He is ordered to report to Nashville that next night. He tells the pastor he won't go, that he'll hide in the hills and fight them if they come after him. Alvin is told by Pastor Pile that \"The war is clear across the ocean, and a lot can happen before you get there.

York proves to be well versed, and his beliefs are confirmed.\nThe major hands York a copy of the History of the U.S. and tells him the book is full of stories about great men. He tells York about the concept of freedom, including it's importance to men like Daniel Boone, who was a very well known figure to York. The major goes on to explain that the preservation of freedom sometimes requires the full measure of devotion, which is a man's life. Major Buxton allows York to take a 10 day leave of absence, to go home and think about his feelings and beliefs. He asks to take the history book with him and the major tells him to go ahead.", "Back in Tennessee, Alvin takes one of his hunting dogs, the U.S. history book, and the Bible, and sits on a rock ledge, reading and thinking in solitude about his options. He is confused about whether country or God comes first in a man's life. When he reads the words attributed to Jesus: \"Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's,\" that helps him decide. He returns to Georgia and tells Major Buxton he had decided to stay in the Army, even though there were many things he hadn't fully figured out yet.

York pulls a grenade and lobs it in front of the Germans, halting their escape.", "York and few men from his division take some prisoners. As they proceed to try and find their way back to the American's line, they are ambushed by a German machine gun. The senior non-comms are injured too badly to continue, so Sergeant Bernard Early orders York to take over. York immediately takes off around a side hill and takes out two machine guns that had the men pinned down. He proves just as good with a handgun as with his rifle. His fire is so deadly and efficient, that dozens of Germans surrender, not realizing it's just one man attacking them.", "One German decides to pull the pin on a grenade he had and he throws it, killing Pusher. York goes to find the man who threw it and when the man runs, York shoots him. He tells the German officer to order his men to drop their utility belts and not to try anything like that again. There's only seven U.S. soldiers with York, controlling maybe 50-75 Germans.", "They march on through the trench with their prisoners, coming upon some more fighting.

One of them misses Riggs and accidentally kills the bad guy Riggs had been talking to. Riggs shoots two of the bad guys before another grabs him and holds a gun to his head. Riggs then plays the part of a true psycho as he screams at the guy to shoot him. When the guy doesn't, Riggs head butts him, grabs the gun and seems intent on shooting the man in the head, but pulls back at the last second.", "Arriving back home at his trailer on the beach, carrying a new TV set, Riggs asks Sam what he did all day, then lovingly calls him \"a lazy son-of-a-bitch,\" as he prepares to make them both some turkey sandwiches.", "Riggs becomes very sad as he stares at a photo of Victoria. He grabs his gun and inserts a hollow point shell, then places the end of the barrel against his forehead, pausing before he re-positions the gun barrel inside his mouth and cocks the hammer. Tears flow as he seriously considers pulling the trigger and joining his wife in death, but he can't do it. He tells Victoria she'll have to wait.", "Dr. Stephanie Woods (Mary Ellen Trainor), the police psychiatrist, wants Captain Murphy (Steve Kahan) to take Riggs off the street, advising him that Riggs is very likely suicidal and a danger to himself and others. The captain disagrees and refuses to act. He apparently believes Riggs is just trying to set himself up with a medical discharge and pension. Murphy coldly tells her that if Riggs kills himself, they'll know she was right.", "The investigation into Amanda Hunsaker's death determines that she had been using cocaine and took some barbiturates that someone had laced with drain cleaner. So, even though she jumped to her death, she would have died within minutes anyway because of the drain cleaner. Plus, there was evidence that someone had been in bed with her that same night. As a result, her death is declared a murder.", "Captain Murphy decides to reassign Riggs to work with Murtaugh in Homicide. As they are about to meet for the first time, Riggs pulls out his weapon to play with it at the police station. Murtaugh sees that and attempts to take down Riggs, thinking he's some nut with a gun. Riggs quickly incapacitates Murtaugh with a judo move, throwing him to the floor. Murtaugh is introduced to his new partner by a fellow officer.", "Later, as the two walk to their undercover car, they compare firearms. Riggs uses a 9 mm Beretta. Murtaugh uses a more traditional 4\" Smith & Wesson. Riggs doesn't miss the chance to refer to Murtaugh's weapon as an \"old timer's\" gun. Murtaugh says he also knows from looking over Riggs' personnel file that he knows some sort of martial arts. He figures they'll have to consider Riggs to be a \"lethal weapon.\" Both Murtaugh and Riggs figured they are getting \"fucked\" by the system, evident in their being assigned as partners.", "Mr. Joshua (Gary Busey) and Mr. Mendez (Ed O'Ross) meet outside a nightclub. Joshua takes Mendez inside to meet General Peter McAllister (Mitchell Ryan). McAllister heads up a group of former CIA and special forces men who now use their skills and former contacts in Asia to participate in the illegal drug trade. Mendez wants to arrange to purchase some heroine, but he's upset at his rude reception and isn't impressed that a bunch of mercenaries are doing the deal. To emphasize to Mendez that he should take them seriously, McAllister forces him to hold his own cigarette lighter under Joshua's bare arm, until it burns him. Joshua doesn't flinch from flame and grimaces, taking the pain. He informs Mendez that if he tries to screw with them in anyway on the planned transaction, he'll have to deal with Mr. Joshua.", "Murtaugh goes to see Michael Hunsaker (Tom Atkins) and informs him that his daughter was actually murdered. He asks Michael why he'd been trying to contact him the past few days. Hunsaker tells him that he was trying to contact him to help Amanda get out of the underworld of drugs, prostitution and hardcore pornography that she'd become involved with. Hunsaker seems quite distraught that his daughter was murdered and he reminds Murtaugh that he owes him a favor, which Murtaugh acknowledges as a heavy debt. Hunsaker had taken a bayonet in the chest during the Vietnam war, saving Murtaugh's life in the process. He now wants Murtaugh to find his daughter's murderer(s) and kill them.", "Murtaugh and Riggs receive a call to respond to the scene of a potential suicide jumper. At the scene, Riggs claims to have experience in suicide negotiation and goes up on the roof to speak to the jumper. He gets out on the ledge with the man. The man is very agitated and keeps warning Riggs to stay away and not touch him. Riggs offers him a cigarette, which the man accepts. Riggs makes as though to light the cigarette, then suddenly reaches out and snaps a handcuff on the man's arm, and then the other cuff to his own arm. He then throws the key down to the street. He tells the guy that if he jumps now, he'll have company and he'll have murdered a cop. The guy becomes even more agitated until Riggs furiously asks the guy if he really wants to jump, and he launches himself off the ledge, taking the guy with him. Murtaugh, watching from below, says, \"oh, shit!\" They land on a huge inflated cushion and are unhurt -- Riggs had distracted the jumper long enough for the ground unit to inflate the cushion. On the ground, Riggs happily suggests to the guy that they go back up and jump again, but the guy is screaming for the police/firemen to get Riggs away from him.", "Murtaugh is livid and drags Riggs over to a nearby shop where they engage in a shouting match about Riggs being reckless and having a death wish. Murtaugh tells Riggs that if he wants to kill himself so bad, then to do it. He then thrusts his gun into Riggs hand and pushes it up to Riggs' head, daring him to do it. Riggs starts to apply pressure to the trigger and Murtaugh has to put his hand in front of the hammer to prevent it from falling. At that moment, Murtaugh is convinced that Riggs really doesn't care if he lives, that he's truly psychotic and not just playing a game to qualify for a medical pension. Riggs' face softens and he becomes calmer and stalks out of the storefront, muttering about getting something to eat.", "Murtaugh speaks with Dr. Woods on a mobile phone and she confirms that he should be very worried about what Riggs might do out in the field. Murtaugh is very upset about a number of things now, his age, his partner and all the risks he has to deal with.", "Murtaugh and Riggs finally break through some of the extreme tension that exists between them when Riggs finds out it Murtaugh had his 50th birthday and he offers to buy him a present, \"if we live long enough.\" Riggs' joke makes Murtaugh laugh. They don't stop arguing though, as Riggs lights up a cigarette and Murtaugh tells him he doesn't want him smoking in the car. Riggs keeps smoking anyway.", "Riggs and Murtaugh go to see and talk with a pimp that Amanda Hunsaker was associated with. They arrive at a gated community home, and come upon two girls crouched over a table with drugs on it. As they approach the girls, a man appears with a shotgun and takes a shot at them. Murtaugh shoots the man in the leg. As Riggs is securing the girls with handcuffs, Murtaugh approaches the man, at the same time letting Riggs know that because he shot the guy in the leg, and didn't kill him as Riggs would have done, they can now interrogate him. As Riggs is lifting the man to his feet, the man produces a handgun. Riggs draws his gun and shoots the guy before he can shoot Murtaugh. The man falls onto some plastic sheeting covering a swimming pool and gets tangled up and drowns before Riggs and Murtaugh can extract him. Although Murtaugh is upset that the man died, he's also grateful for Riggs saving his life.", "Murtaugh takes Riggs home with him to meet his family and have dinner. The two youngest children, Nick Murtaugh (Damon Hines) and Carrie Murtaugh (Ebonie Smith) ask if Riggs is a crook. Rianne is enthralled by Riggs, something which Roger notices right away and is not happy about.", "Murtaugh looks in the oven but isn't able to identify the substance in there cooking. His wife, Trish, who calls him \"Sarge,\" informs him that she is cooking a pot roast. Murtaugh apparently doesn't think she's much of a cook and he later can't believe that Riggs thinks the roast was good. Riggs then admits that it wasn't.", "At the supper table, the younger kids start making up a silly rap song. Roger joins in and everyone has a good laugh. Murtaugh takes Riggs outside to see his fishing boat. As he's working in the engine compartment, Riggs reaches over and starts the engine. Murtaugh jumps up and calls Riggs an asshole for scaring him.", "Rianne asks her father for permission to go out with Mark, a boy that Murtaugh refers to as \"the blonde with dimples on his face.\" Murtaugh reminds her that she's grounded for smoking a joint, so he says no.", "Riggs tells Murtaugh that he has a nice family and prepares to leave for home. As he's leaving, he says, \"you don't trust me, do you?\" Murtaugh says, \"if we make it through tomorrow without your killing anyone, including me, then I'll start trusting you.\" Riggs senses a need to get serious for a moment and responds by saying, \"I'm good. In Laos I killed a guy from 1,000 yards, under windy conditions. It's the only thing I'm good at.\"", "On the way home, Riggs stops and picks up a hooker on the street, paying her $100 just to go with him to watch the Three Stooges on his little TV.", "Later that night, Murtaugh opens a large envelope that came in the mail. Inside is a Palos Verde High School yearbook, from 1983, and a VCR. On the videotape is Amanda Hunsaker, half undressed and parading around with some other women. Murtaugh shuts the video off in disgust and notices that Amanda has a twin sister in the yearbook.", "The next morning, Riggs wakes Roger up with a cup of coffee, babbling about a few clues regarding Amanda's death -- Roger angrily orders Riggs out of his bedroom. Murtaugh and Riggs go to the shooting range and try to piece together the events of the night that Amanda died. They come up with a \"thin\" explanation regarding Dixie and her eyewitness account of the incident but decide they have to check every lead. Murtaugh is proud of the grouping he has after his first round of shots. Riggs shoots and brings in his target, a much tighter grouping than Murtaugh's, who sarcastically asks if Riggs sleeps with his gun under his pillow. Riggs replies \"I would if I slept.\" Murtaugh decides to try again and fires just one shot at mid-range. It strikes the center of the outline of a man's head on the target. Riggs then sends his target all the way downrange and unloads his pistol. When it comes back, a smiley face surrounds Murtaugh's single shot. Though he doesn't say so, Murtaugh is quite impressed.", "Having earlier found drugs at the pimp's home, and the pimp ending up dying, Murtaugh assumes the Hunsaker case was closed, but Riggs finds it suspicious that the only witness to Amanda's suicide was the prostitute Dixie, who was working away from her usual \"stroll\". They deduce that Dixie poisoned Amanda and then posed as a witness to cover her crime.", "Murtaugh and Riggs go to see Dixie. As they exit their car, there are four little kids who figure out immediately that they are cops and they start chanting, \"you're gonna bust Dixie.\" As the detectives near the house, the house suddenly explodes and burns.

When one of the kids asks if Dixie might have been home, Murtaugh looks at Riggs, who nods in agreement.", "Later, in the smoldering wreckage, Riggs finds the remains of a mercury switch, evidence of a professional explosives job, possibly by someone who with military training. Alfred, one of the kids, a six-year old boy, tells them he saw a man reading the meter a little earlier in the day while he was hiding under the porch. He described the man as tall, white, blonde and sporting an Army Special Forces tattoo, just like the one on Riggs arm. Riggs becomes very concerned and can be heard muttering to himself, wondering if the fire department has any openings. Riggs reflects a bit on the circumstances of what they might be dealing with: mercenaries and mercury switches.", "Murtaugh goes to see Mr. Hunsaker at his home where a memorial service is being held for his daughter. He demands to know what Hunsaker is involved with that got his daughter killed. Hunsaker is reluctant to answer because he has another daughter he's worried about, but eventually he tells Murtaugh that for more than two years he has been involved in a heroin-smuggling operation run by a group of ex-CIA and special forces mercenaries that came from a unit called Shadow Company, operating under the guise of Air America, a CIA-fronted organization that ran their version of the Vietnam war from Laos. The scheme is masterminded by a retired general, Peter McAllister (Mitchell Ryan) the former commander of Shadow Company and his chief enforcer, Mr. Joshua (Gary Busey). Hunsaker was laundering the groups' profits through his bank. McAllister had ordered Amanda's murder when her father, Michael, unsuccessfully tried to alert Murtaugh to the scheme in an attempt to get out of the business. As Murtaugh attempts to get Hunsaker to reveal the entirety of his operation, the window behind Hunsaker explodes and Hunsaker falls dead. Outside, perched in a helicopter, is Mr. Joshua with a large sniper's rifle in his hands.

Riggs takes the blast in the chest and is thrown through a plate glass window as Joshua's car peels off. As Murtaugh rushes up to help, it's revealed that Riggs is wearing a bulletproof vest and is just bruised and in pain, and very angry.

He wants to find out what Murtaugh knows about their impending heroin transaction with Mr. Mendez.", "As Riggs and Murtaugh prepare for whatever lies ahead, Riggs tells Murtaugh that this time they do it his way, and shoot to kill. He says, \"We're gonna get bloody on this one, Roger.\" Murtaugh asks Riggs, \"Are you really crazy, or as good as you say?\" Riggs tells Murtaugh he'll just have to trust him.", "Joshua calls back and directs Murtaugh to meet them at El Mirage Lake, a dry lake bed near Victorville, CA, the next day. He tells Murtaugh that they just want to know what Michael Hunsaker told him, then they'll let Rianne go.", "The next day, Murtaugh drops Riggs off about a quarter mile from the meeting site. Riggs is armed with a sniper's rifle and he takes a prone position, hidden in some dry brush and waits. Before long, a white limousine, a black SUV, and a helicopter all approach. A total of about 10 armed men exit from the vehicles and helicopter. Murtaugh demands to see his daughter. Rianne is pulled from a vehicle and Joshua exits from the other side.", "One of the armed men demands that Murtaugh remove his hands from his pockets before they proceed. Murtaugh does so, and reveals that he's holding an armed grenade. He demands that his daughter be released immediately, or they will all die. He explains that he realizes he and Rianne would be killed as well, but at least they'd die together. Joshua approaches Murtaugh and whips his arm up, revealing a gun that he uses to shoot Murtaugh in the shoulder. Murtaugh drops the grenade and everyone scatters, but the grenade turns out to be only a smoke bomb.", "Riggs opens up with his weapon, shooting the two men on either side of Rianne with pinpoint accuracy, then the driver of the limo.

As he about to pull the trigger, McAllister appears, ordering Riggs to surrender, which Riggs does.", "The helicopter gives chase of Rianne in the limo, eventually causing her to high center the car and she is recaptured. Murtaugh had taken refuge behind his car and then attempted to run away, but he is quickly captured.", "As they both walk back, Riggs acknowledges that he knows General McAllister and that he'd come across some of his Shadow Company \"pussies\" while in Vietnam. He tells McAllister that he's going to enjoy bringing him down.", "Joshua is preparing to interrogate Riggs. He introduces his associate, an Asian man named Endo (Al Leong), an expert at torture. They have suspended Riggs from some ropes around his wrists. He's shirtless and there's a shower of water cascading over him from above. Endo has the ends of some battery cables and a sponge in his hands. He touches them to Riggs torso, causing extreme shock and pain. Joshua had promised to kill Riggs quickly if he'd just tell him what Hunsaker had told them about the upcoming heroine shipment. Riggs figures he's in for a long night, because Hunsaker hadn't told them anything. Riggs finally falls unconscious and Endo tells Joshua that he believes Riggs doesn't know anything. Joshua orders Endo to go ahead and kill Riggs.", "As Endo approaches to administer the final shock, Riggs suddenly comes to life and head butts Endo. He then lifts his legs up and wraps them around Endo's neck and breaks it. He quickly manages to escape from his bonds and goes to help Roger and Rianne.", "McAllister has Murtaugh strapped to a chair and subjected to a severe beating, with salt poured onto his shoulder wound, but he is helpless to stop it because he had no knowledge of the details of the heroin transaction. McAllister, either not believing Murtaugh or not caring, prepares to harm Rianne when Riggs bursts into the room. Riggs creates immediate mayhem, taking down and/or killing all but General McAllister, who runs and escapes. Riggs removes the bonds holding the Murtaughs and they all leave the building and head for the lounge that served as headquarters for the mercenaries.", "Riggs shoots the bartender and two others, somehow avoiding harm to any of the many customers in the lounge. They see Joshua and he leads them out into the street to continue the fight. Joshua stops a car and pulls the driver out and takes the wheel. Roger turns Rianne over to the care of a uniformed officer who appears at the scene and joins Riggs in giving chase on foot. Murtaugh can't run very well since he was injured, so he shouts at Riggs to cut over to the freeway and catch Joshua there. Meanwhile, Murtaugh decides to go find McAllister.", "Riggs sees Joshua entering the freeway and fires his machine gun at the car, causing it to veer off the road briefly and burst into flames. Joshua keeps driving the car as long as he can, then abandons it and commandeers an Audi and takes off again. Riggs had made his way down to the freeway by then and he gets hit by a taxi, bouncing off the windshield and has to give up the chase.", "General McAllister and his driver make to escape from the warehouse in their car. Murtaugh is waiting outside for them. He calmly stands and fires as the car approaches, killing the driver. McAllister leans over and takes the wheel. Murtaugh has to jump aside as the car speeds past. McAllister has no control over the accelerator and brake pedals, so he can only steer as the car enters a main street, where it's t-boned by a large bus and flipped over. The general is upside down, bleeding, surrounded by bags of drugs and several grenades. As McAllister is reaching, apparently trying to grab the grenades, they explode, destroying the car and him.", "Riggs and Murtaugh are reunited at the crash scene. When Murtaugh learns that Joshua escaped, he tells Riggs they have to get back to Murtaugh's house immediately, as that's likely where Joshua will go. They grab another detective's car and take off.", "Joshua arrives at Murtaugh's house, which is being guarded by two uniformed officers in a patrol car. He pulls up to the police car and shoots both officers dead. He goes up to the house and uses his automatic weapon to blast through the door. No one is home. He finds a note stuck to the Christmas tree that says \"Dear bad guys, no one here but us good guys.\" At that moment, the front wall of the living room caves in and an empty police car crashes into the room, a police baton wedged onto the accelerator. Riggs enters the room immediately after and sticks a gun to Joshua's head. Murtaugh tells Joshua that his \"general friend had his nuts barbecued on Hollywood Boulevard.\" Riggs can see that Joshua can't stand that he's in the predicament he's in and is searching for some way out. He asks Joshua if he wants to \"try for the title,\" via hand-to-hand combat. To allow that to happen, Murtaugh has to quickly take control of other arriving police and tell them to stay back, to let things play out.", "Riggs and Joshua fight hand-to-hand furiously, using a variety of martial arts, with each alternately appearing to take control, only to have things switch around again. Police are all around, watching. A beam from a police helicopter shines down and a broken fire hydrant is spraying water over the entire area.", "Riggs finally gets Joshua in a scissor-leg lock, but for some reason he decides not to snap Joshua's neck and lets go of him. As two officers move in to handcuff Joshua, he grabs a gun from one officer's holster and points it at Riggs. Riggs, who was being helped up by Murtaugh, quickly spins around. He and Murtaugh both bring their handguns to bear and they fire almost simultaneously, killing Joshua. Riggs finally collapses in his partner's arms.", "On Christmas day, Riggs is seen visiting Vicki's grave, cleaning some debris from it, then he tells her \"Merry Christmas, I love you.\"", "Riggs goes to the Murtaugh's home, the front of the house all patched up from the damage it incurred. Rianne answers the door and offers to go get her father. Riggs says no, that he just wanted her to give Roger something. He then hands her the single hollow point bullet that he'd reserved for killing himself, wrapped in a red ribbon. He tells Rianne to tell her father that he wouldn't be needing it anymore.", "As Riggs turns to go, Roger chases him down. He tells Riggs that he has to stay there and help him eat the \"world's lousiest Christmas turkey.\" Riggs agrees, and observes to Roger how his daughter seems to like him. Roger tells Riggs that if he tries anything with Rianne, he'll kill him. Riggs asks if he can bring a friend to dinner, then calls Sam from his truck. Sam comes running and once he's inside the house, the sounds of Sam's barking and Burbank's (the Murtaugh's cat) screeching can be heard, as the two get acquainted."]},

His roommate, Neil Perry, although exceedingly bright and popular, is very much under the thumb of his overbearing father.

Each does so in his own way, and is changed for life.", "A new English teacher, John Keating, is introduced to an all-boys preparatory school that is known for its ancient traditions and high standards. He uses unorthodox methods to reach out to his students, who face enormous pressures from their parents and the school. With Keating's help, students Neil Perry, Todd Anderson and others learn to break out of their shells, pursue their dreams and seize the day.", "Vermont, New England, 1959. The students at Welton Academy have been trained for generations to lead lives of conformity and tradition--until charismatic new professor John Keating sets foot in the institution, motivating them to think for themselves, live life to the fullest, and \"Carpe Diem\". As a result of his unconventional approach, inspirational Keating awakens the students' spirits, encourages them to be exceptional individuals, and challenges them to achieve their full potential. However, when tragedy strikes the school, drawing the wrath of a disapproving faculty, Keating and his boys will find themselves at loggerheads with the school's officials, the parents, and the system.", "New England, the late 1950s. Todd Anderson (Ethan Hawke), a lonely and painfully shy teenager, who is under pressure by his stern parents because he must live up to his older brother's reputation to attend Yale and become a lawyer, arrives for the new semester at the Welton Academy for boys -- Todd's brother also attended Welton and was a popular and well-regarded student there. This semester begins during an orientation gathering with a speech given by the stern Headmaster Nolan (Norman Lloyd), who states the academy's four pillars: Tradition, Honor, Discipline, and Excellence. Todd meets Neil Perry (Robert Sean Leonard) a friendly and ambitious student whom becomes his dorm roommate.", "Later in his dorm, Neil is ordered by his grumpy and domineering father (Kurtwood Smith) to drop his involvement with the school annual in order to maintain good grades so the boy may become a doctor much as he has done. Neil is under pressure from his stern father's will. Also, Mr. Perry tells Neil that Mrs. Perry also wants him to become a doctor, which further worries the boy. A little later, Todd tells Neil that he is in a similar situation with his parents involving his older brother who also attended Welton a few years ago, graduated, and attended Yale Law School and became a lawyer and his parents want the exact same thing for him. But Todd does not have the courage to tell his parents that he instead wants to be a writer, not a lawyer.", "During the first day of classes Todd and Neil experience the various teaching methods which include speeches by the trig teacher, as well as the Latin teacher, and the chemistry teacher who states that \"all 20 questions at the end of the first chapter are due tomorrow\". In stark contrast to these orthodox teaching methods, the guys see a different side of the school when they attend English class taught by the newly arrived (and liberal-minded) Mr. Keating (Robin Williams), whom they met briefly during the orientation -- Keating tells his class he was also a student at \"Helton\" (as the students secretly refer to the institution) himself many years ago. Keating enters his class smiling and whistling the 1812 Overture, and he first takes the boys out in the hallway to the school's displays cases containing photos and artifacts of the school's sports achievements. He tells them that they all have the potential to become powerful individuals, and they are responsible for what their futures will hold. These two actions show his difference from the other teachers because no other teacher would commit the actions he does. Also, he tells the boys they may call him \"Oh Captain, my Captain\", (the title of a poem by Walt Whitman about Abraham Lincoln) if they dare. These examples of Mr. Keating's teachings show the boys how to think for themselves. Mr. Keating then tells the boys \"Carpe Diem\", which is Latin for \"seize the day\".", "In addition to Todd and Neil, a small group of other students whom include the lovesick Knox Overstreet (Josh Charles), the flip Charlie Dalton (Gale Hansen), the pragmatic Richard Cameron (Dylan Kussman), liberal Steven Meeks (Allelon Ruggiero) and the moderate Gerard Pitts (James Waterston), also react to the first day's lesson with comments from \"that was weird\" to \"neat\". Cameron asks if anything Keating told them will be on a future test and the boys respond with mild scorn.", "The next day Keating starts the class with a traditional teaching approach by having Neil read out loud the introduction to their poetry textbook, which describes how to rate the quality of poetry according to mathematical plotting. Keating finds such mathematical criticism ridiculous and instructs his pupils to rip out the essay which is one of three ways that he demonstrates freedom of expression and non-conformity. When some students hesitate, he tells them \"this is not the Bible. This is a battle, a war. You will have to learn to think for yourselves.\"", "A few days later, Knox Overstreet is asked to attend a dinner party at the Danburry household, friends of his parents. When he arrives, a beautiful girl answers the doorbell and intently captures his attention. Later, he learns that the girl, Christine Noel, is dating Chet Danburry, but does not give up the hope of dating her.", "One day, Neil finds an old Welton yearbook with Mr. Keating in it. After seeing that Mr. Keating listed \"Dead Poets Society\" as one of his activities at the school, the boys ask Mr. Keating what this was. He replies that the DPS was a secret club dedicated to taking the meaning out of life. To do so, the members would sit in a cave near a certain pond less then a mile from school grounds and recite poetry, philosophically drawing life lessons from it to enhance their lives and appreciation of literature. With this new idea in their head from asking Mr. Keating what the DPS was, Neil and the boys decide to start up the DPS once again.", "While coming inside after recess, Neil convinces the boys to join the DPS and meet at midnight by the creek to start their first meeting. Todd tells them that he will come along to the meeting as long as he does not have to read any poetry. When they arrive at the cave, the boys hold their first meeting. Knox shows up so that he can build confidence, like learning pretty poetry, to swoon Christine. The boys begin to learn how rhythm and language in poetry can enhance their own learning and life experience.", "During their next poetry class, Mr. Keating makes the boys stand on his desk to see the world from a different perspective, another way he demonstrates non-conformity and freedom. At the end of class, Mr. Keating orders the boys to write an original poem for homework which will be read aloud during Monday's class. As he leaves the room, Keating singles out Todd and tells him he knows such an assignment frightens him.", "Keating's unorthodox teaching methods soon circulate quietly among the other teachers who scorn his liberal and idealist methods. During dinner, the Latin teacher tells Keating, \"you are taking a big risk in making your students think they are artists\". Keating replies: \"I'm only trying to make them free thinkers\". The Latin teacher, a reader of the Realist literature movement, rebukes him by saying, \"free thinkers at age seventeen?\", reciting some poetry from a Realist poet to emphasize his point. Keating recites another line \"It is only in their minds that men can truly be free. T'was always thus, and always thus shall be.\" When the professor asks him if that passage belongs to a Realist poet, Keating smiles, telling him he'd made it up on the spot.", "Neil attempts to seize the day by trying out for a part in the play 'A Midsummer Nights Dream' the school is putting on -- such an act is done in full defiance of his father's wishes. Meanwhile, Knox goes to a nearby public high school football game and sees Christine in the arms of Chet, who is a football player at that school.", "Back in English class, Mr. Keating has the boys kick soccer balls while yelling poetry aloud, the final way that he demonstrates freedom and non-conformity. Then, Neil receives a letter that says he got the part of Puck in the play. Now he must forge a letter of permission to the headmaster and Mr. Perry, along with their signature of approval.", "The next day in class, Mr. Keating tells Todd to stand up and recite his poem. When Todd tells his teacher that he did not write a poem, Mr. Keating tells the boy to make one up right now on the spur of the moment, taking him to the front of the room. Todd's new poem is about a portrait of Walt Whitman on the wall, and Mr. Keating seems to have an astounding affect on Todd. Todd improvises with Keating's aggressive but kind coaching and he refers to Whitman as the \"snaggly-toothed madman.\" The rest of the class, including one of the more cynical students applaud Todd's efforts.

Neil finds Todd sitting alone and disappointed and boosts his roommate's confidence by telling him that he should take the desk set and throw it to see how aerodynamic it is. Todd's mood is instantly improved.", "When Knox goes to Christine's party that night, he's asked by several of the local high school's football players to join them in a toast to his brother, a football hero, despite Knox' insistence he's not their guy. Later, he becomes drunk and finds himself sitting next to a mostly unconscious Christine on the couch. He recalls Keating's words \"carpe Diem\" and kisses her, only to be caught by Chet, who punches him out. Though Christine comes to his aid, Knox leaves the party.", "The day after the DPS meeting, which is also attended by some girls Charlie invited, Dalton writes a joking and anonymous letter on behalf of the DPS to the school asking if girls may be admitted to Welton Academy. Charlie also takes the bold but foolish step of signing the letter from the DPS. During a hastily arranged school meeting which addresses this letter, a phone is heard ringing. Charlie pulls out a hidden phone, answers it and says the call is from \"God\" and that God wants girls to attend Welton. The school's headmaster holds a private meeting with Charlie, demanding to know who is in the DPS. Charlie refuses and the headmaster paddles him harshly. The headmaster later talks to Keating, telling him he is aware of Keating's unorthodox teaching methods and that encouragement of free-thinking among the students is dangerous. Keating later talks to Charlie and the boys, telling the recovering Charlie that \"sucking the marrow out of life doesn't mean choking on the bone.\" In the newer era of the school, where discipline is much harsher, pranks like Charlie's can have the effect of hurting a student's future rather than making them a school legend.", "When Neil's father arrives at Welton on an unexpected visit, he scolds Neil for joining the play and orders him to quit. Neil tells Mr. Keating about the incident, and that his father won't allow Neil to act. To this, Mr. Keating suggests that Neil tell his father how the boy truly feels. Neil does, but his bossy and stubborn father continues to refuse to let him partake in the play and tells Neil that he must focus all his energy on studying to become a doctor. A few days later, Neil lies to Mr. Keating and tells him that his father allowed him to continue with the play.", "When Knox goes to Christine's high school, he embarrasses her in class by giving her flowers and reciting poetry. Christine goes to Welton where she angrily tells Knox that his actions embarrassed her in front of her classmates. Knox apologizes and asks Christine if she would go to Neil's play with him. Christine is again embarrassed, but flattered by the attention Knox displays, accepts his offer as a date.", "At the theatre, Neil gives a great performance as Puck. As he is about to give Puck's closing monologue, Neil spots his father looking stern and angry from the back but receives a standing ovation. Neil is angrily driven home by his father, who also tells Keating to stay away from his son. While at home, Mr. Perry tells Neil that in retaliation for his defiance, he will pull Neil out of Welton and forcibly enroll him in Braden Military School to prepare him for Harvard University and a career in medicine. Unable to cope with the future that awaits him or make his stern and narrow-minded father understand his emotions, Neil commits suicide by shooting himself with his father's gun.", "The next day in school, the boys are told of Neil's suicide and in separate meetings, each is questioned about the DPS after Cameron reveals the club's secrets to the headmaster. Dalton is expelled from the Welton Academy when he punches Cameron for betraying them. Cameron's defense of his actions is that they can all save their respective futures at the school if they cooperate, even if they can't keep Keating from being fired.", "When Todd is called to Nolan's office, where his parents are waiting, Nolan forces Todd to admit to being a member of the Dead Poets Society, and tries to make him sign a document blaming Keating for abusing his authority, inciting the boys to restart the Dead Poets Society, and encouraging Neil to flout his father's authority. Todd sees Richard's, Knox's, Steven's and Gerald's signatures already on the document. At first, Todd refuses to sign, but when Nolan threatens to expel him and his equally stern parents threaten to disown him should he be kicked out of school, the painfully shy Todd does not have the nerve to argue with any of them and signs the paper.", "Keating is fired from Welton and is forced to leave without any severance pay or letter of recommendation to teach at any other public or private school in the state. Although the other teachers at Welton have disapproved of his teaching methods, most of them are somewhat upset to see the likable and friendly Keating leave", "The next day, Headmaster Nolan arrives at English class where he tells the students that he is their new teacher until a substitute will arrive to replace him. The shy and afraid Todd cannot respond when asked what the boys have done in the class so far, so Nolan asks Cameron. He tells the teacher that the class thoroughly covered poetry, but skipped over Realism. The headmaster tells them they will start over and to read the introduction to their textbook, but it is ripped out, so he gives Cameron the teacher's book to read from. Just then, Mr. Keating enters the room to collect a few of his papers before he leaves. Todd reveals to Keating that he and the other students were intimidated into signing the confession. Keating tells Todd that he already knows. Nolan orders Todd to be quiet and demands that Keating leave, threatening any other student who speaks up with expulsion.", "As Keating is about to exit the classroom, Todd finally breaks through his cowardice and self-pity and calls out: \"O Captain! My Captain!\" and then stands on top of his desk and faces Keating, giving him a farewell salute. Nolan immediately yells at Todd to sit down or face expulsion. In what is probably the movie's most touching and emotionally powerful scene, one by one, Knox, Steven, Gerard, and all of the members of the Dead Poets Society, except for Cameron and a few other students, climb onto their desks and face Keating to salute their former teacher. Knowing they are too many for the school to expel en masse quietly, they remain standing on their desks despite Nolan's orders for them to sit back down until he gives up and slumps against the teacher's desk, angry and emotionally defeated. Seeing that his work at the school had not been in vain, a visibly touched Keating says: \"Thank you, boys. Thank you.\" With Todd and the other the students looking on, Keating then happily leaves the classroom with tears in his eyes, and walks out of the school for good."]},

They decide to drive through the South. Once they arrive in Alabama, they stop at a local convenience store to pick up a few snacks. But, no sooner than they leave the store, they are arrested. They had thought that they were arrested for shoplifting, but they were arrested for murder and robbery. Worse, they are facing execution for this crime. Bill and Stan do not have enough money for a lawyer, so the good news is that Bill has a lawyer in his family, his cousin, Vincent Laguardia Gambini. The bad news is that Vinny is an inexperienced lawyer who has not been at a trial. So, Vinny has to defend his clients and battle an uncompromising judge, some tough locals, and even his fiancée, Mona Lisa Vito, who just does not know when to shut up, to prove his clients' innocence. But he will soon realize that he is going to need help.", "New York friends Bill Gambini and Stan Rothenstein, driving the scenic route to Southern California where they will be attending college, are in rural Alabama when they are pulled over by the police. Thinking they will be charged with shoplifting as Bill had just discovered that he inadvertently left the Sack-O-Suds convenience store without paying for a can of tuna, and confessing to \"the crime\" when questioned by Sheriff Farley, they find that they are instead charged, in their \"confession\", of murder and accessory to murder of the store clerk with witnesses claiming to have seen two young men driving away from the store following gunshots, they and their vehicle fitting the description given by the witnesses. With Bill's mother back in New York the only person they know to call, and unable to afford a high-priced lawyer as poor college students, they are advised to have Bill's cousin, Vinny Gambini, represent them. A stereotypical brash Italian Brooklynite, middle-aged Vinny only recently passed the bar and is a proverbial ambulance chaser with no trial experience. Regardless, Bill has faith in Vinny in the Gambinis being experts in arguing. Vinny is even more of a fish out of water than Bill or Stan, as that status is both in locale with the New York gang viewing the Deep South as backward and corrupt, but also in the courtroom, especially in Vinny's dealings with uncompromising Judge Chamberlain Haller. Still, Vinny knows the importance of what he is tasked to do in Bill and Stan's lives being on the line. Added to the mix is Vinny's equally brash girlfriend, Mona Lisa Vito, who wants to help in any way she can as Vinny has told her they will get married after he wins his first case, but with Vinny always putting her to the side in wanting to prove his mettle as a lawyer on his own.", "Two teenage boys from New York are travelling down south when a series of coincidences lands them in jail charged with first degree murder. They can't afford the $50K for an attorney so they call the lawyer cousin of one of the boys. Vinny is a stereotypical New Yorker who is initially a complete disaster, but can he get them off the hook ?", "While heading for college, Bill and Stan are arrested in Alabama when circumstances point to them as having murdered a convenience store clerk. Unable to afford an attorney, they turn to Bill's cousin Vinny, a brash New Yorker who took six tries to pass his bar exam. Worse, until now he's only taken personal injury cases, none of which have gone to trial. Dragging along his even more abrasive fiancee Mona Lisa Vito, Vinny will have to straighten up fast, and keep out of jail himself, if he's going to win the case.", "While driving through the fictional Beechum County, Alabama, New Yorkers Bill Gambini (Ralph Macchio) and his friend Stan Rothenstein (Mitchell Whitfield) accidentally neglect to pay for a can of tuna after stopping at a convenience store. After they leave the store, the clerk is shot and killed, and Billy and Stan, who match the descriptions of the murderers given by witnesses, are then pulled over and detained in connection with the murder.", "Due to circumstantial evidence and a series of miscommunications based on the boys' assumption that they have merely been detained for shoplifting, Billy falsely says he shot the clerk (his tone is indignant but taken down as a confession) and ends up being charged with murder, and Stan is charged as an accessory.", "The pair call Billy's mother, who tells her son that there is an attorney in the family, Billy's cousin, Vincent LaGuardia \"Vinny\" Gambini (Joe Pesci), who travels to Beechum County accompanied by his fiancé, Mona Lisa Vito (Marisa Tomei). Unfortunately, although he is willing to take the case, Vinny is a personal injury lawyer from Brooklyn, New York, newly admitted to the bar (after six attempts and six years) with no trial experience.", "Although Vinny manages to fool the trial judge, the stoic Chamberlain Haller (Fred Gwynne), about being experienced enough to take the case, his ignorance of basic court procedures and abrasive, disrespectful attitude towards the judge gets him into trouble immediately. When Vinny is ordered to enter a plea of guilty or not guilty, he tries to talk his clients way out of the charges without a trial, much to the irritation of Haller, who also admonishes Vinny's attire of a leather blazer and unkempt hair and charges him with contempt of court and has him sent to jail for a night.", "Later, much to his clients' consternation, in the initial hearing Vinny does not cross-examine any of the witnesses. As their claims go unquestioned, it appears that the district attorney, Jim Trotter III (Lane Smith) has an airtight case that will inevitably lead to a conviction at the trial. Vinny is again charged with contempt for not dressing properly and is ferried away to the same jail as his clients. On the way, he explains to them both that a trial was inevitable considering the charges and the case being brought in a Southern town.", "After Vinny's poor showing at the hearing, Billy and Stan decide to fire him and use the public defender, John Gibbons (Austin Pendleton), but Vinny asks for one more chance to prove himself. He shows Billy that Trotter's case is based entirely on circumstantial evidence with little real proof by using a simple card trick and claiming that it's going to be much harder to fool a Gambini than Trotter believes.", "The trial then opens with Vinny representing his cousin and the public defender representing Stan. Despite some further missteps, including wearing a gaudy secondhand tuxedo to court when his suit is accidentally covered in mud and sleeping through Trotter's opening statement, Vinny shows that he can make up for his ignorance and inexperience with an aggressive, perceptive questioning style.", "While the public defender is shown to have a debilitating stammer, Vinny quickly and comprehensively discredits the testimony of the first witness. Vinny makes a point of grilling the man until he confesses that he, at least, misremembered some of the details about spotting the crime while cooking grits for his breakfast. Billy's faith is rewarded, and Stan develops newfound respect and confidence for Vinny, firing the public defender.", "Vinny's cross-examinations of the remaining eyewitnesses are similarly effective and respectful. He is able to prove conclusively that an elderly woman with poor vision and very thick-lensed spectacles couldn't have seen even half the distance she claimed. A third witness admits that he couldn't have possibly seen the crime happen through a dirty window, rusty screen and several bushes and trees in his line of sight. Trotter shoots back and produces a surprise witness, George Wilbur, an FBI analyst who testifies that his chemical analysis of the tire marks left at the crime scene shows that they are identical to the tires on Billy's Buick Skylark, even the same model of Michelin tire. With only a brief recess at a nearby restaurant to prepare his cross-examination and unable to come up with a particularly strong line of questions, Vinny becomes frustrated and lashes out at Lisa by taunting her about the usefulness of her wide-angle photographs of the tire tracks at the crime scene. She storms out, leaving Vinny alone. Back in court, he later realizes that that photo actually holds the key to the case.", "Vinny needs Lisa, an expert in automobiles, to testify to this. After requesting research from the local sheriff (later revealed to be a records search for a stolen automobile) Vinny drags Lisa into court as a rebuttal witness to Wilbur. She is questioned by Trotter about her expertise in automobiles (\"voir dire\") and soundly foils his attempt to discredit her with a trick question. Trotter allows her to testify.", "During Vinny's questioning, Lisa comes to the same conclusion regarding the tire marks and testifies accordingly. The tire marks at the crime scene couldn't have been laid by a 1964 Buick Skylark like Billy's, which did not have a suspension and differential system called \"Positraction\" that would have made two flat and even tire streaks like those in the photo. She also claims that the car that actually made the tire marks must have been a 1963 Pontiac Tempest which is very similar in size to a '64 Skylark and would have Positraction and would be available with the same color paint because cars were made by General Motors. Vinny and Lisa both relish their victory and seem to have resolved their earlier argument. Trotter and Wilbur have a tense and quiet conversation until the judge interrupts them and Vinny recalls the FBI analyst who corroborates Lisa's testimony.", "Next, Vinny calls the local sheriff, who has run the records request. The sheriff testifies that two men resembling Billy and Stan were recently arrested in Georgia driving a stolen 1963 Pontiac Tempest equipped with the same Michelin tires as Billy's car and in possession of a gun of the same caliber used to kill the clerk. Trotter then respectfully moves to dismiss all the charges.", "Throughout the story, Vinny and Judge Haller play a game of cat-and-mouse over Vinny's qualifications. Haller first discovers that, despite Vinny's claims that he tried \"quite a few\" murder cases, there exist no records of anybody named Vincent Gambini trying any case in New York State. Vinny then claims that he had his name changed during a previous career as a stage actor and continued to use the name when he opened a law practice.", "Vinny, believing that he should give the judge the name of someone with the kind of resume he claimed to have, supplies the name of a prominent New York attorney, Jerry Gallo. Unfortunately, Lisa later tells Vinny that Gallo died the previous week, and when Haller learns this, Vinny claims that Haller misheard \"Gallo\" when Vinny actually said \"Callo\". Finally, Lisa clears Vinny's standing by calling his mentor, Judge Malloy from New York, who responds to Haller's request by claiming that Jerry Callo has a long and impressive trial history.", "The film concludes with Haller apologizing for doubting Vinny and praising his skills as a litigator. Vinny and Lisa then drive off together, bickering about their future wedding plans."]},

Soon after, \"K\" Company commander Lt. Joe Clemons (Gregory Peck) meets with division commander Col. Davis (Barry Atwater) to receive orders to retake the area and is assured that \"L\" Company will protect Clemons' flank. Knowing that Pork Chop Hill holds no strategic value, Clemons surmises to friend and co-commander Lt.

As the two platoons ascend the hill at dusk, American artillery bombards the crest but the men are nevertheless unnerved to hear a Chinese propaganda broadcaster in the central command bunker calmly call out criticism of their foolhardiness and list statistics of American losses.", "Unknown to Clemons, back at division headquarters, Davis learns that \"L\" Company has been delayed getting into position because they have misconstrued their orders to provide support for Clemons' company. Once the American shelling stops, Clemons' men fall under an increasingly heavy enemy barrage and the soldiers are then shocked when bright spotlights from their own position abruptly shine down upon them, escalating enemy fire. The lights go off, and moments later, the radio man informs Clemons they have received an apology from the American group responsible for the spotlights who mistook their location for another.", "At dawn, still some distance from the enemy trenches and with his platoon severely depleted, Clemons is unable to rouse Ohashi on the radio and sends a messenger in search of the second platoon. Meanwhile, Clemons' men are startled to hear the sound of trumpets blaring, heralding a ferocious assault by the Chinese. When the fighting slows, Clemons finally reaches Ohashi by radio and demands assistance, but Ohashi reports he has lost a quarter of his men and cannot hold his position near the crest if he divides them. Dismayed by the lack of promised support along the hill's left flank, Clemons orders a small squad to provide machine gun cover there. Later, when the nearly decimated squad returns to report to Clemons, he contacts Davis to complain bitterly about the lack of assistance. Davis insists that the crest be taken as soon as possible and ignores Clemons' protest that he has too few men to accomplish the task.", "Ohashi reports that he has lost nearly half of his platoon and requests the third platoon be activated, but Clemons believes they should be held in reserve as long as possible. Disheartened, Ohashi nevertheless agrees and returns to maintain his position as Clemons is joined by a handful of soldiers dashing up the hill. Clemons is stunned to learn the 12 men are the only survivors from \"L\" Company, whose two platoons were slaughtered in their attempt to provide delayed assistance to \"K\" Company. The remainder of Clemons' platoon, joined by the additional men, then rush the next line of trenches and bunker and are relived to find it has already been secured by Ohashi's men.", "While the soldiers greet one another, the bunker is suddenly hit by numerous artillery shells. Although severely shaken, most of the men survive and angrily insist the shells came from their own side. Realizing the exhausted, demoralized men are correct, and fearing a revolt, Clemons lies, countering that the artillery came from a nearby, Chinese-held mountain.", "Anxious over the long silence from Davis, Clemons meets with Ohashi to decide upon their next action. Clemons summons Lt. Waldorf (John Alderman) and the third platoon and declares the crest must be taken to avoid the continued attrition of the remaining American forces. Knowing that Waldorf is inexperienced, Ohashi volunteers his men to make a risky bayonet charge against the crest. Clemons promises a diversionary action as well as support and the move is successful.", "Afterward, Clemons radios Davis' headquarters, which have now come under an intensive enemy barrage. Cut off after hearing Pork Chop Hill has been taken at last, Davis is unaware of Clemons' desperate plea for supplies and ammunition. Soon after, \"K\" Company's last radio is destroyed, but Clemons is pleased by the arrival of his brother-in-law, Lt. Walt Russell (Rip Torn), commander of \"G\" Company.

Moments later, a messenger arrives with news from Davis that \"G\" Company has been recalled, as Davis believes the hill secured.

Harley knocks Robin out and kidnaps him. For three weeks, Batgirl and Batman search the city for Robin until they come upon an obvious Joker booby trap. The 'gift box' erupts, leaving evidence that points Batman to the remains of Arkham Asylum, long since abandoned due to a relocation. They enter the asylum where the Joker and Harley welcome them in a grim scene resembling a casual family outing. They introduce the newest member to their 'family', their 'son' Joker Junior - Tim. Dressed in a suit matching the Joker's and wearing a freakish smile on his pale face, Tim is clearly brainwashed by the Joker's toxins. In a fury, Batman attacks the Joker while Batgirl pursues Harley. Batgirl and Harley fight in the rusted upper levels of the asylum and Batgirl demands to know why Harley allowed the Joker to do such a thing. Harley admits that they 'roughed' Tim up a bit, but she'll make it right. Harley is then knocked into a crevasse and, before Batgirl can pull her back up, loses her grip and falls into darkness.", "Meanwhile, the Joker flees further into the asylum and begins to play 'home movies' on a large projector screen for Batman to watch. Joker darkly narrates how he first captured Robin and tortured him until his will broke, at which point he began to share secrets. Joker calls Bruce by his name and admits that he finds it rather pathetic that Batman is, after all, merely a 'little boy in a playsuit crying for Mommy and Daddy'. When the projection ends, Joker ambushes Batman and slashes his chest with a knife before stabbing him in the leg and knocking him hard to the floor. Joker stands over Batman and tosses a gun to Tim who is standing nearby. Tim aims the gun at Batman and Joker encourages him to finish him. Tim pulls the trigger, laughing maniacally, and a BANG flag pops out. Batman begs to Tim, calling him by his name, as Joker becomes impatient. Tim's face twitches despite his laughter and he quickly re-aims the gun and pulls the trigger. The BANG flag shoots out, launching into the Joker's chest and knocking him back. He coughs blood and mutters, \"Thats not funny,\" before dying. Tim's laughter then succumbs to tears as Batgirl returns. She comforts Tim before they all leave together.", "Completing her story, Barbara explains to Terry that the Joker was buried beneath Arkham, Harley's body was never found, and Tim spent over a year with a friend, Leslie Tompkins, while his mind recovered, though he never again took up the mantle as the Boy Wonder. Barbara herself left the Dark Knight's company later on and relations between the three of them have never been the same. Tim is now a communications engineer and seems to be doing fine.", "Suspicious of Tim's current mental state, Terry takes the Batsuit back and decides to examine him in stealth. However, he is spotted right away due to Tim's years of training with the elder Batman. Tim swears that he has put his old life behind him and is less than nostalgic about his life as Robin. Regardless of his suspicions, Terry follows a secondary theory in Jordan Price, knowing that he harbors resentment against Bruce. He finds Price on his yacht surrounded by the Jokerz gang. Batman confronts them and Price admits that he gave the gang clearance so that they could steal goods from the factory but knows nothing about the attempt on Wayne's life. The Jokerz then reveal that they've been assigned to kill Price in order to 'tie up loose ends'. Batman saves Price as his yacht explodes from a localized beam of energy from above while the Jokerz escape once more. On shore, Batman gives Price to polic ealong with a recording proving his involvement with the Jokerz. Price is taken into custody.", "In the Batcave, a recovered Bruce sits with Ace at the computer, sullen over his inability to piece anything together. Terry confronts him and claims that the 'real' Batman would have recalled something to solve the case by now but Bruce claims that things are rarely that simple. He admits that he did not want Terry to end up like Tim; bitter, which is why he asked for the suit back. As they argue, Terry suddenly notices that, among the items in the cave smashed from the Joker's attack, only the Robin suit was shredded beyond recognition. Adding that to the fact that everything the Jokerz gang had stolen is consistent with communications software leads Terry's suspicions all the more to Tim as the answer behind the Joker's true identity. Following more research, Terry and Bruce discover that the stolen items could create a satellite defense system which Terry realizes was responsible for the spontaneous destruction of Price's yacht.", "Bruce instructs Terry to suit up and investigate. Terry requests one more weapon for his arsenal: Ace.", "Batman confronts Tim again at the local research station but finds that he is nothing more than a hologram. As the image disappears, the Joker communicates with Batman, seemingly confirming Terry's theory, and activates the satellite defense laser, destroying the station. Batman and Ace barely manage to outrun the laser with the Batmobile. After tracing down the Joker's headquarters, Batman engages the residing Jokerz gang one on one, with Ace helping to fight against the animalistic Woof. Having subdued the gang, Batman goes further inside and finds the real Tim who appears confused and unsure of how he got there. Batman becomes impatient with Tim's behavior and calls him out on working for the Joker. Tim suddenly suffers a flashback of killing the Joker and falls into a state of panic. Batman offers to call an ambulance, but Tim insists that he is fine, calling Batman 'Terry'. Shocked that Tim would know his true identity, Terry falters as Tim attacks and restrains him, telling him to stick around so that he won't miss the show.", "Tim then undergoes a transformation where he is revealed to be the Joker himself! Joker explains to a shocked Terry and Bruce that, while Tim was under his wing, he was also part of a breakthrough genetic experiment. The Joker implanted a microchip into the back of Tim's head where the Joker's DNA was essentially implanted; leading to Tim's transformation into a clone of the Clown Prince, all while remaining unaware. The Joker powers up the satellite defense system again and happily lists a few possible targets: the hospital where Dana is recovering, the park where Terry's mother and brother are, and Wayne manor. Not intimidated by Batman's threats, the Joker remains confident that he knows everything the old Batman and Robin knew at the top of their game and is thus one step ahead. But Batman asserts that the Joker doesn't know a thing about him. Ace then appears and attacks Joker, giving Batman time to escape. Bruce gives Terry some tips about the Joker; that he is very vain and likes to talk and not to let him get into Terry's head. Terry then comes up with an idea; he likes to talk too.", "Hiding in the rafters, Batman calls out to Joker and insults him, calling him less than a comedian and berating his unoriginal jokes. He surmises that the reason the Joker got such a kick out of teasing the original Batman was because he could never get a laugh out of him. He then starts laughing. This quickly infuriates the Joker who launches several bombs into the rafters, damaging the control system for the satellite in the process and re-aiming the beam onto the factory itself. Joker manages to knock Batman out of the ceiling and pins him down, choking him. He laughs in his face and maniacally begs one more laugh out of him. Batman manages to choke out a \"ha-ha\" as he takes an electric hand buzzer and zaps the microchip on the back of the Joker's neck, destroying it and whatever essence of the Joker was in Tim. Back to his old self, Tim collapses. Batman collects him and Ace and escapes the factory just before the satellite beam destroys it.", "Later, the Dee-Dee twins are released from jail on bond into the custody of their grandmother who beats them over the head, calling them ungrateful. The girls leave with her, calling her Nana Harley.", "The next day, Terry visits Tim in the hospital with Barbara. Tim thanks Terry for saving his life and notes that he is a fine successor to Bruce as Batman. As Terry leaves, Bruce appears in the doorway and makes peace with Tim.", "That night, Terry dons the Batsuit once more, vowing to continue the legacy."]},

The problem is, Diane hardly knows her secret admirer exists. As if that weren't enough, Diane's doting but overprotective father thinks his sweet only daughter deserves better.

Lloyd meets Diane's father and is very gentlemanly and polite.", "Upon arrival at the party, people are intrigued by the fact that Lloyd has shown up with Diane Court. It appears as if this is the first time that Diane has ever socialized with anyone, and they seem pleased that she showed up. It seems that while her classmates admired her, very few know her level at all.

Panic ensues not only in the general population, but also within the police forces in the Boston area; they begin to apprehend and question every known sexual criminal.

To show the public that the Commonwealth of Massachusetts is taking the matter seriously, the state attorney general appoints law professor John S. Bottomly to lead a multi-jurisdictional task force to apprehend the perpetrator. Bottomly feels ill-equipped to do so. Eventually he and his team come across two leads: one a victim, Dianne Cluny, who survives her strangling, and the other a man named Albert DeSalvo being detained for a seemingly unrelated crime. Bottomly notices that DeSalvo, who is institutionalized when he is diagnosed with a possible case of dissociative identity disorder, has an injury matching one that Cluny inflicted on the strangler. Beyond his mental disorder, DeSalvo seems like a decent man. Regardless, Bottomly wants to find out conclusively if DeSalvo is indeed the strangler, even if he will never be tried for the crimes, and even if it causes DeSalvo possible permanent injury to his psyche."]},
